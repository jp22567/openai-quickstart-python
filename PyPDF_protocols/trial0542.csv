General Design and Methodology: This is a Phase 2/3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group study in which patients with tics associated with TS will be invited to participate. Patients who qualify for the study will be central ly random ized in a 1:1 ratio (stratified by age at baseline [6 to 11 years, 12 to 16 years]) to receive either TEV -50717 or placebo. Throughout the study, patients w ill interact regularly with investigative site personnel, in clinic and by telephone, for the evaluation of safety, tic severity, and behavioral status (in clinic only). The target dose for each patient receiving TEV -50717 w ill be based on body weight and cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) impairment status at baseline. Patients will be classified as CYP2D6 impaired if they are receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor or are a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer based on blinded assessment of CYP2D6 genotype at baseline. CYP2D6 status will be used by Interactive Response Technology (IRT) for randomization into the stud y. The dose of IMP for each patient will be titrated to an optimal level follow ed by maintenance therapy at that dose. Investigators will be blinded to CYP status, with a dose cap for poor metabolizers prespecified by the IRT. The overall treatment period will be 12 w eeks in duration, including a titration period of 7 weeks, a maintenance period of 5 weeks, followed by a washout period of 1 w eek . For the YGTSS, input from the caregiver/adult is required. For both the TS -PGII and , input from the ca regiver/adult is permitted. For all other scales, for children 13years of age and under, interviews may be performed separately or jointly with the caregiver/adult as appropriate or defined by the scale; for children over 13 years of age, caregiver/adult involvement is strongly encouraged."

It should be noted that the CDI -2 has individual parent and child questionnaires. Patients who complete the study may be eligible to begin participation in an open -label safety extension study TV50717 -CNS -30047 after the end of the washout period. At the week 13 visit, patients may choose to enter Study TV50717 -CNS- 30047 (on that day), or they will have an additional week to make a decision and return for day1. Patients not participating in Study TV50717 -CNS -30047 w ill have a follow -up telephone contact to evaluate safety 1 week after the end of the washout period (2 weeks after their last dose of IMP). Screening period (up to 31 days) : After informed consent/assent, depending on the child’s age, as appropriate, is obtained, patients who are stable from a medical and psychiatric standpoint will undergo a screening evaluation, including medical history, ph ysical and neurological examination, laboratory testing, and 12 -lead ECG, along with rating scales to assess severity, frequency, and impairment of tics and comorbid TS symptoms and behavioral status. At the discretion of the investigator, the screening v isit may be divided into 2 visits if the visit length is felt to be too burdensome for the patient. If the screening visit is divided into 2 visits, the blood sample should be obtained during the first of the 2 visits. Patients who have received comprehens ive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT) for TS or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD) may participate in this study as long as therapy was completed at least 4 w eeks prior to screening. Patients will return to the clinic on day 1 for baseline procedures and to re -confirm eligibility. Patients may be rescreened 1 time if there is a change in the status of the patient regarding eligibility for the study . (Note: Details of rescreening must be approved and documented by the medical monitor and/or Clinical Surveillance and T raining [CST] team. ) YGTSS Rater Certification: All investigators and subinvestigators who will be administering the YGTSS from screening through the end of study visit must undergo and pass a Rater Certification Program which will be provided separately from this protocol. Every effort must be made to ensure that the same certified rater administers the YGTSS to a specific patient at all visits, especially at the baseline and week 12/early terminatio n visits . How ever, if due to unforeseen circumstances the same rater is absolutely unavailable to complete a visit rating, the YGTSS can be administered only by another certified individual from that study site . Titration period (7 w eeks) : Patients who rem ain eligible for participation in the study will be randomized at the baseline visit (day 1), and that evening (ie, after the study visit) will receive 6 mg of blinded IMP w ith food. Tablets should be taken with food (eg, a snack) and should not be taken o n an empty stomach. The titration scheme and maximum dose will be determined by body weight and CYP2D6 impairment status at baseline, as shown in the tables below . Patients and their caregiver/adult will interact weekly with the clinical research staff, ei ther by telephone contact or clinic visit from week 1 through week 7 of the titration period, in order to evaluate safety and establish a dose of IMP that optimally reduces tics and is well tolerated (optimal dose). Safety evaluations during titration incl ude assessment of vital signs, monitoring for adverse events and concomitant medications, 12 -lead ECGs, and rating scales for depression and suicidality. In-person (in -clinic) study visits will be scheduled at weeks 2, 4, and 6, and telephone contacts will be scheduled for weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7 in order to assess tic severity and adverse events. The dose of the IMP should be increased on a weekly basis until one of the follow ing criteria is met: The investigator determines there has been a clinically meaningful reduction in tics as indicated by a sustained reduction in the TS -CGI. The patient experiences a protocol -defined “clinically significant” adverse event (defined as an adverse event that is related to study medication and is either moderate or severe i n intensity or meets the criteria for a serious adverse event). The maximum allowable dose is reached based on the patient’s weight and CYP2D6 impairment status at baseline."
13,page_13,"Placebo -Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 05 Study TV50717- CNS -30046 13Although dose adjustments can be made up to and including the week 7 telephone cal l, if a stable dose is reached before then, the patient should continue on that dose (ie, the dose should not be increased further) for the remainder of the titration period and throughout maintenance dosing, unless there is a change in symptoms during the titration period. If a patient experiences a “clinically significant” adverse event attributable to the IMP, the investigator w ill determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary. If the determination that a patient requires a dose reduction or suspension is made during a telephone contact, an unscheduled clinic visit should be conducted as soon as practicable thereafter. Dose adjustments should be made based on all available information, including the patient and caregiver/adult reports of advers e events and tic reduction, the clinical assessment of safety and efficacy by the investigator, and information from rating scales. At the end of the titration period, the patient’s dose will be established for the maintenance period. Maintenance period (5 weeks): Patients will continue to receive their maintenance dose over the next 5 w eeks, although dose reductions for adverse events are allowed. Patients will return to the clinic at w eeks 9 and 12 for assessments of safety and efficacy. At week 12, patie nts will undergo a complete evaluation, including physical and neurological examination, safety laboratory testing, and 12 -lead ECG, CDI -2, and C -SSRS assessments, as well as the YGTSS, TS -CGI, TS -PGII, , , and C&A- GTS -QOL. In addition, patients will undergo pharmacokinetic sampling at week 12. Washout period and follow -up:All patients will discontinue IMP at the w eek 12 visit and will return 1 week later for evaluation of safety and tic reduction (week 13). Patients who co mplete the study may be eligible to begin participation in the open -label safety extension study, TV50717 -CNS -30047, at that time. For this study, the follow -up period is defined as 1 w eek of washout for patients who will participate in the open -label safety extension study TV50717 -CNS -30047 and 2 w eeks after the last dose of IMP (1 week after the end of the washout period) for patients who will not roll over into the open -label safety extension study TV50717 -CNS -30047. At the week 13 visit, patients may ch oose to enter Study TV50717 -CNS -30047 (on that day), or they will have an additional week to make a decision and return for day 1. Patients not participating in Study TV50717 -CNS -30047 w ill have a follow -up telephone contact for safety evaluation 1 week after the end of the washout period (2 weeks after their last dose of IMP [w eek 14]). Prohibited drugs will remain the same during the washout period for patients who will participate in the open -label extension study TV50717 -CNS -30047. Patients who will not participate in the extension study (Study TV50717 -CNS -30047) may begin/resume tic therapy medication after the first week of the washout period. Method of Blinding and Randomization: Patients will be randomly assigned to receive treatment with TEV -50717 or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio using an IRT. Patients will be stratified by age at baseline (6 to 11 years, 12 to 16 years). Patients and investigators will remain blinded to treatment assignment during the study. In addition, the sponsor’s clinical personnel and all vendors (with the exception of the IRT vendor and the bioanalytical sample analysis vendor) involved in the study will be blinded to the IMP identity until the database has been locked for analysis and the treatment assignments are revea led.After unblinding of this study, the study site may remain blinded to patient treatment assignments until completion of the safety extension study TV50717 -CNS- 30047. IMP Dose, Mode of Administration, and Adm inistration Rate: IMP w ill be administered a s oral tablets at a starting dose of 6 mg. Titration schemes based on body weight at baseline are shown in the tables below . The m aximum daily dose is determined by body weight and CYP2D6 impairm ent status at baseline (see the table below ). Although dose adjustments can be made up to and including the"

If a patient experience s a “clinically significant” adverse event that is attributed to the IMP, the investigator will determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary. At the end of the titration period, the patient’s dose will be established for the maintenance period. If a patient experiences an adverse event during the maintenance period and the investigator believes a dose reduction in warranted, the dose may be reduced. TEV -50717 tablets are available in the following dose strengths: 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 mg, all of which are identical in size, shape, and color (white). The IMP w ill be supplied in 40 -count blister packs. The placebo tablets and packaging will match those for TEV- 50717. IMP w ill be administered as follow s: IMP should be sw allow ed whole and taken with food. Tablets should be taken with food (eg, a snack) and should not be taken on an empty stomach. Dosing will be based on body weight and CYP2D6 impairment status at the baseline visit, as shown in the tables below . The starting dose is 6 mg in all patien ts. Daily doses will be administered twice daily, approximately 8to 10 hours apart during the day. A minimum of 6 hours should elapse betw een doses. If a patient misses a dose, and it is within 6 hours of their next dose, the missed dose should be skipped . After week 1, dose increases may not occur more frequently than every 5 days. Dose reductions, if required, should be in increments of 6 mg. If more than 1 dose reduction is required for an adverse event, the m edical monitor must be notified. During the titration period, the dose of IMP should be adjusted w eekly according to the table below to identify a dose level that optimally reduces tics and is well tolerated.

Blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed at the week 12 visit. T wo samples will be collected. The firs t sample will be collected upon arrival at the clinic. The second sample will be collected 2 to 3 hours after the first pharmacokinetic sample collection. The time between samples should be maximized in order to provide the most useful information. Patient s with early morning visits (ie, w ithin 2 hours of their scheduled AM dosing) should take their dose in the clinic after the first pharmacokinetic sample is collected. Patients will be provided w ith a diary to provide critical information on dosing before the week 12 visit. The date and time of the last dose of study medication before the w eek 12 visit should be recorded in the diary by the patient or caregiver/adult. The site w ill document the date and time of the sample collection. Prior to the clinic vi sit on week 12, patients will be reminded to record the start time of their last meal and the time of their last dose in their diary Plasma samples for both α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ m etabolites will be pooled w ith previous data and incorporated into a population pharmacokinetic analysis. The population pharmacokinetic analysis will result in a final structural model that best describes the data. A covariate assessment will evaluate the relationship betw een potential covariates (ie, body weight, age, height, etc) a nd concentrations of α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ m etabolites. The final population pharmacokinetic analysis will be included in a separate report. Exposure -response (eg, pharmacodynamic [PD] and/or safety endpoints) may be assessed if the appropriate data are availa ble. At the screening visit, a blood sample ( 3mL) will be obtained for analysis of CYP2D6 genotype. The patient’s genotype for CYP2D6 w ill remain blinded d uring the conduct of the study."

Statistical Considerations: Sample Size Rationale :It is estimated that approximately 58 patients per arm will enable a pow er of at least 90% to detect a beneficial standardized effect of 63% or m ore when the TEV -50717 arm is compared to placebo (difference of 6.0 in the change from baselin e to week 12 in TTS, assuming a standard deviation of 9.5 in each arm) in a 2 -sided type I error rate of 5% after accounting for potential dropouts. Analysis of Prim ary Endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is t he change in the TTS of the YGTSS from baseline to w eek 12. The primary analysis will be a mixed -model repeated -measures model with the change in the TTS as the de pendent variable. The model will include fixed effects for treatment group, week (5levels: Weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 ), and the treatment group by week interaction. The baseline TTS , region, and age group at baseline will be included as covariates. The unst ructured covariance matrix for repeated observations within patients will be used. The least squares means of the change in TTS from baseline at w eek12 w ill be compared (the active treatment arm and the placebo arm) using a 2 -sided test at the alpha=0.05 level of significance. In addition, actual values and changes in the TTS from baseline to each visit will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Analysis of Key Secondary Endpoints: A hierarchical (fixed -sequence) testing approach will be used for th e analysis of the primary and key secondary endpoints to maintain the experiment -wise type I error rate of 5%. If an endpoint is not statistically significant, confirmatory hypothesis testing will not be carried out on the remaining hypotheses, and remaini ng hypotheses will be considered exploratory rather than confirmatory . The change in the TS-CGI (1) and C&A -GTS -QOL ADL subscale (3) scores from baseline to week 12 will be summarized and analyzed in the same fashion as the primary analysis, with the excep tion that the baseline value of the given endpoint will be included as the covariate. TS-PGII (2) w ill be analyzed using a Cochran - Mantel- Haenszel row mean score test with a modified ridit score that controls for age group. Exploratory Analyses:"
20,page_20,"Placebo -Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 05 Study TV50717- CNS -30046 20 Multiple Com parisons and Multiplicity: The hierarchical testing method w ill be used to maintain the experiment -wise type I error of 5% level for the primary and key secondary analyses. The primary efficacy endpoint will first be tested at the 5% type I error level. If the p -value of the primary analysis is ≤0.05, the secondary hypotheses will be tested in the order listed for the secondary endpoints until either an an alysis produces a p-value >0.05 or all analyses result in a p -value ≤0.05. Analysis of Pharm acokinetic Endpoint: Samples collected for pharmacokinetic analysis will be quantified for α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ active metabolites and will be analyzed using population pharmacokinetic techniques. Analysis methods will be detailed in a separate population pharmacokinetic analysis plan. Exploratory pharmacokinetic/PD analysis may be performed on PD/safety endpoints. Safety Analyses: All adverse events will be co ded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Each patient will be counted only once in each preferred term or system organ class category for the analyses of safety. Summaries will be presented for all adverse events, adverse events determin ed by the investigator to be related to study treatment, serious adverse events, and adverse events causing withdraw al from the study. Summaries will be presented by treatment group and for all patients. Patient listings of serious adverse events and adver se events leading to withdrawal will be presented. Observed values and changes from baseline in laboratory results and vital signs will be summarized descriptively. Observed values in ECG parameters will be summarized, and counts and percentages of abnorm al findings will be presented. In addition, the number and percentage of patients with on -treatment QTcF values >450, >480, or >500 msec and change from baseline >30 or >60 msec will be presented. The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by th erapeutic class using descriptive statistics. Concomitant medications will include all medications taken while the patient is treated with IMP. Observed values in the C -SSRS and observed values and changes from baseline in the CDI -2 (Parent and Self -report versions) will be presented by treatment group for all patients."

Introduction Tourette s yndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized b ymultiple motor and phonic tics that frequently co -occurs with a variety of behavioral and ps ychiatric problems (Jankovic 2001, Jankovic and Kurlan 2011). Studies have suggested that up to 7% of school children fulfill the diagnostic criteria for TS ( Kurlan et al 2002 ). Tics are classified as either simple or complex; simple motor tics include ey e blinks, shoulder shrugs, while simple vocal tics include grunting, coug hing and sniffing. Complex motor tics include touching/tapping and walking in patterns, while complex vocal tics include echolalia (repeating another’s speech) and coprolalia (shouting obscenities or profanities) ( Jankovic 2001, Shaw and Coffey 2014). TS was thought to be a ps ychogenic disorder until improvement with neuroleptics was first observed in the 1960s, leading to the theory of central dopaminergic hy peractivit y as a possible mechanism of tics associated with TS. When the sy mptoms impair function, most physicians utilize alpha adrenergic drugs (guanfacine, clonidine), t ypical neuroleptics (haloperidol, pimozide, fluphenazine), or at ypical neuroleptics (olanzapine, ziprasidone, aripiprazole) to control tics (Gilbert and Jankovic 2014 ,Wijemanne et al 2014 ). In the United States of America (USA), haloperidol and pimozide are approved for the treatment of tics associated with TS, while aripiprazole carries a broader indication of “for the treatment of TS”. Neuroleptics have the potential for serious adverse effects, including tardive dy skinesia (TD), which ty pically manifests as an irreversible orofacial stereot ypy, and other forms of h yperkinetic movement disorder ( Waln and Jankovic 2013 ). Up to 25% of adults chronicall y treated with dopamine receptor antagonists (neuroleptics; including the so- called “at ypical” neuroleptics, such as aripiprazole) eventuall y develop TD ( Jankovic 1995 ,Pasricha et al 2006 , Peña et al 2011). Although elderly individuals, especiall y women, are particularl y susceptible to developing TD, this iatrogenic condition may also rarely occur in children ( Mejia and Jankovic 2010 ). Tetrabenazine, which depletes dopamine pres ynaptically , has been shown to be effective in treating the tics associated with TS ( Jain et al 2006 ,Jankovic 2015, Jankovic and Beach 1997 , Kenney et al 2007, Paleacu et al 2004 ,Porta et al 2008), but has not been documented to cause TD in clinical use. While generally effective in reducing the tics of TS, tetrabenazine is associated with frequent adverse events, including somnolence, nausea, depression , insomnia, and parkinsonism, that may limit its utility . Moreover, tetrabenazine is an immediate -release formulation with the following limitations: (1) adverse events of tetrabenazine, such as somnolence, akathisia, and anxiety , are often associated with peak concentration after dosing; (2) the active metabolites have short half-lives, with the attendant requirement to dose the immediate -release formulation frequentl y; and (3) the active metabolites alpha- dihydrotetrabenazine (α -HTBZ) and beta- dihydrotetr abenazine (β- HTBZ) are either primarily (α) or exclusivel y (β) metabolized by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Poly morphisms in the CYP2D6 gene necessitate genoty ping to prevent poor metabolizers from experiencing significantly greater exposure to the active drug moiety than extensive metabolizers (Mehanna et al 2013 ). To address the limitations of commercial tetrabenazine (Xenazine®), Auspex, a wholly owned subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc, developed deutetrabe nazine (referred to"
34,page_34,"Placebo -Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 05 Study TV50717- CNS -30046 34as TEV -50717, previously SD-809) that is eliminated more slowly than tetrabenazine. TEV -50717 has been shown to reduce plasma fluctuation and dosing frequency and thus can improve overall tolerability as compared to that of tetrabenazine. Data in patients receiving TEV -50717 for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD) demonstrate a favorable safety profile with low rates of neuropsy chiatric adverse events. In TS patients with troublesome motor and phonic tics, pre liminary efficacy and safety data for TEV -50717 have been generated in an open- label, Phase 1b pilot study (SD-809-C- 17). Results of this study are summarized in Section 1.3.2.2 and support further development of TEV -50717 for treatment of tics associated with TS. TEV -50717 was granted breakthrough status for treatment of TD by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on the results of Study SD -809-C- 18, and NDA 209885 was granted priorit y review status. TEV - 50717 was approved for the treatment of chorea associated with HD on 03 April 2017 and for the treatment of chorea associated with TD on 30August 2017. 1.2. Name and Description of IMP TEV - 50717 (deutetrabenazine) is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor with the chemical name (RR, SS) - 1,3,4,6,7,11b- hexahy dro- 9, 10 -di(methoxy- d3)-3-(2-methy lpropy l)- 2H-benzo[a]quinolizin -2-one. TEV -50717 is provided for this study as 6-mg, 9 -mg, 12-mg, 15-mg, and 18 -mg oral tablets, all of which are identical in size, shape, and color (white). The investigational medicinal product ( IMP)will be supplied in 40- count blister packs. A more detailed description of the product is given in Section 3.8. 1.3. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies Brief summaries of nonclinical pharmacology , pharmacokinetics, and toxicology studies and clinical studies are provided in the following sections. More detailed information is prov ided in the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB). 1.3.1. Nonclinical Studies The key nonclinical study findings are provided below, with details available in the IB. 1.3.1.1. Nonclinical Pharmacology TEV -50717 is a selectively deuterium -substituted VMAT2 inhibitor struct urally related to tetrabenazine. The metabolites formed from TEV -50717 (α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ) are potent inhibitors of VMAT2 binding, with K ivalues of 3.8 and 22 nM, respectively, that are similar to previously reported values of their corresponding non -deuterated forms ( Scherman et al 1988 ). Off-target binding occurs to a similar extent with deuterated and non -deuterated α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ. TEV -50717 and tetrabenazine in male rats at doses resulting in similar sy stemic exposure t o the test articles (α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ) produced similar, expected, exaggerated central nervous s ystem (CNS) pharmacological effects. In particular, the adverse event of cataleps y, a known response in rats to drugs which reduce CNS dopamine concentrations (Fuenmay or and Vogt 1979), was similar in magnitude after TEV -50717 and tetrabenazine administration."
35,page_35,"Placebo -Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 05 Study TV50717- CNS -30046 351.3.1.2. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism In human liver S9, the metabolite profile of TEV -50717 overlapped with that of tetrabenazine. In a clinical comparative human [14C]-absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion and mass -balance study , the approximately 22metabolites of TEV -50717 were also metabolites of tetrabenazine. Thus, previous clinical experienc e with tetrabenazine provides predictive information about the safety of TEV -50717 and its metabolites. Tetrabenazine, α -HTBZ, and β- HTBZ, and b y extension, their deuterated forms, do not inhibit or induce cy tochrome P450 ( CYP) isoenzy mes at clinically relevant concentrations ( Xenazine Prescribing Information 2015 ). M1, a minor metabolite that may circulate in greater concentrations as a metabolite of TEV - 50717 as compared to tetrabenazine, is neither an inhibitor of major C YP isozy mes or transporters nor an inducer of CYP isozy mes. M4, a major metabolite of tetrabenazine and TEV -50717 is neither an inhibitor of major CYP isozy mes or transporters nor an inducer of CYP isozy mes. 1.3.1.3. Toxicology General and Reproductive Adult Toxico logy: Oral administration of TEV - 50717 in rats reduced body weight gain, increased mammary hyperplasia, and produced estrouscyclechanges, all of which occurred with tetrabenazine at doses that produced similar s ystemic exposures to test articles and metabolites. Mammary and estrus effects are likely consequences of reduced central dopamine and subsequent increased prolactin, consistent with information in the Xenazine® (tetrabenazine) label. Oral administration of TEV -50717 in pregnant rats did not pr oduce test article -related embry ofetal toxicities, even at doses that led to reduced body weight gain in dams. Oral administration of metabolite M1 to pregnant rats from gestational day s 6 to 17 produced no test article -related maternal or fetal toxicities . Genetic Toxicology : TEV -50717 and its α - HTBZ and β -HTBZ metabolites were negative in in vitro studies for mutagenicity (bacterial reverse mutation, or the Ames test) and for chromosomal structural aberrations in human peripheral blood lymphocy tes. Oral d oses of TEV -50717 were negative for inducing micronuclei in the bone marrow of treated mice. Juvenile Toxicology : The effects of TEV -50717 on juvenile development was assessed in male and female rats with oral dosing from weaning (postnatal day [PND] 21) to PND 71, similar to human dosing from Year 2 through earl y adolescence and overlapping with TEV -50717 oral dosing in a general adult toxicology study . The effects of M1 were assessed in male and female juvenile rats from PND 25 to PND 70 with a recovery phase and postdosing reproductive assessment. TEV -50717 produced no test -article -related effects on learning and memory functions, on histopathology assessments, on reproductive capacity (male and female fertility , estrus cy clicit y), or on intrauterine sur vival of embry os from matings during recovery from test article administration. Adversely reduced body weight gain and adverse clinical observation of tremors and in- cage h yperactivity were all noted in previous studies with adult rats; these effects have not predicted adult clinical intolerance to TEV -50717. The highest dose level of M1 (50 mg/kg/day ) produced no test article -related toxicities (clinical observations, changes in body weight gain, clinical pathology , histopathology , ophthalmology, and perfo rmance in learning and memory tests)."
36,page_36,"Placebo -Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 05 Study TV50717- CNS -30046 36The NOAEL (no- observed -adverse- effect level) for toxicities in juvenile rats is lower than that in adults; however, the total (α+β) -HTBZ exposure multiples or safety margins comparing rat to humans at the adult and juv enile age categories are similar. The potential for increased sensitivity to the effects of TEV -50717 in pediatric patients is mitigated by 2factors. First, the effects of TEV -50717 on behavior and weight gain recovered with cessation of test article admi nistration in the juvenile rat toxicology study. Second, the clinical significance of tremors and reduced bod y weight gain in rats dosed with TEV -50717 are unclear because these findings were not adverse events of note in adults or adolescent patients. Whi le hy poactivity in rats has the potential to relate to clinical observations of somnolence, this adverse effect is controlled with dose reduction. In clinical comparison, the adverse event profile of tetrabenazine in adult patients is qualitatively similar to patients from approximately 22 months to 18 y ears of age ( Jain et al 2006 , Kenney et al 2007, Porta et al 2008 ). 1.3.2. Clinical Studies The clinical development plan for TEV - 50717 to date includes:   1 completed Phase 3pivotal study for the treatment of chorea associated with HD 1 completed Phase 3 long -term safety study in patients with HD 2 completed Phase 2/3 and Phase 3 studies in patients with TD     Further details may be found in the IB. 1.3.2.1. Clinical Pharmacology Studies Seven Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies were conducted in healthy adult subjects. In addition, sparse pharmacokinetic sampling was included in the P hase 3 studies with HD patients where population pharmacokinetic analyses were performed to extensively evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetics/pharmacody namics relationship of TEV -50717. A summary of the clinical pharmacology findings is provided in the IB. Pharmacometric anal yses of the active metabolites of TEV- 50717 based on the Phase 1 clinical pharmacology in healthy adult subjects were performed to support dose selection and pharmacokinetic characterization in a pediatric population. Subse quently , a further pharmacometric anal ysis of active metabolites following administration of TEV -50717 to adolescent TS patients with tics (Study SD-809-C- 17) was recently completed. The results of these anal yses are described in Section 1.3.2.3."

Clinical Safety and Efficacy Studies TEV -50717 has pharmacologic activity indistinguishable from tetrabenazine, a VMAT2 inhibitor with established efficacy intreating the motor and phonic tics associated with TS. 1.3.2.3. Pharmacometrics Analysis of TEV -50717 Active Metabolites to Support Dose Selection and Pharmacokinetic Characterization in a Pediatric Population Population pharmacokinetic modeling of the TEV -50717 active metabolites -HTBZ and β- HTBZ has been performed throughout the clinical development program. Based on sequential pharmacokinetic sampling data obtained in healthy subjects in the Phase 1 program, a structural population pharmacokinetic m odel was developed to guide dose selection for HD patients with chorea (SD -809- CLN -076) and subsequentl y optimized to better describe the absorption/bioconversion profile of -HTBZ and β -HTBZ (Study SD-809- CLN - 077)."
38,page_38,"Placebo -Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 05 Study TV50717- CNS -30046 38Employ ing the structural model defined in Study SD-809- CLN - 077, sequential and sparse pharmacokinetic sampling data obtained from Study SD-809-C- 17 were combined with the Phase 1 data emplo yed in Study SD- 809-CLN - 077 to estimate the exposure total of ( +β)-HTBZ in adolescent patients (age 12 to 18 years) with TS and to simulate exposure in adolescent and pediatric patients (age 6 to 11 years) with and without concomitant use of a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor across a range of doses ( Appendix B). Population model parameters were re -estimated for the combined Phase 1 and adolescent data obtained from patients in Study SD-809-C- 17. The model was used to simulate total ( +β)-HTBZ exposures across a range of body weights corresponding to a pediatric and adolescent population according to the Centers for Disease Control growth charts. This analy sis provides the basis for the dosing recommendations in Section 5.1. 1.4. Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Patients Additiona l information regarding benefits and risks to patients may be found in the current IB and in the United States prescribing information for AUSTEDO™(deutetrabenazine). 1.5. Selection of Drugs and Dosages A detailed description of IMP administration is presente d in Section 5.1. 1.5.1. Justification for Dosage of Active Drug The dose ranges to be evaluated in this study , based on body weight and CYP2D6 impairment status at baseline, were selected on the basis of the safet y, preliminary efficacy , and population pharmacokinetic data generated from Study SD-809- C-17 ( Table 2). In this study , TEV -50717 up to 18 mg twice daily (36 mg/day ) was well tolerated and demonstrated clinically meaningful benefit in adolescents with TS -associated tics. The dosages proposed in the present stud y aim to match the exposure achieved in adults receiving up to 48 mg/day (24 mg twice dail y), a level previous ly demonstrated to be efficacious, safe, and well tolerated in patients with HD-associated chorea. IMP will be titrated on a weekl y basis for 7 weeks, based on investigator, patient, and parent/guardian assessments of tic reduction and adverse event s. Thi s dosing strategy is practical in a clinical setting and affords sufficient time between dose steps for efficacy and safet y to be assessed. It is also consistent with the clinical application of tetrabenazine, another VMAT2 inhibitor with accepted efficacy in this population. A 5 -week maintenance period is sufficient for stable treatment to allow evaluation of safet y and efficacy at the target dose. 1.5.2. Justification for Use of Placebo As TS is not a progressive neurological disorder, and available treatments a re for s ymptomatic control, the use of placebo is justified in a short- term study where safet y is carefully monitored."
39,page_39,"Placebo -Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 05 Study TV50717- CNS -30046 39Moreover, a placebo control is ideal for characterizing the efficacy and safety of an experimental agent in a new stud y population. 1.6. Compl iance Statement This study will be conducted in full accordance with the I nternational Council for Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) E6 and an y applicable national and local laws and regulations (eg, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations [21CFR] Parts 11, 50, 54, 56, 312, and 314, Directive 2001/20/EC of the Eu ropean Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws, regulations, and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the implementation of GCP in the conduct of clinical studies on medicinal products for human use). Any episode of noncompliance will be documented. The investigator is responsible for performing the clinical study in accordance with this protocol and the appl icable GCP guidelines referenced above for collecting, recording, and reporting the data accurately and properly . Agreement of the investigator to conduct and administer this clinical study in accordance with the protocol will be documented in separate cli nical stud y agreements with the sponsor and other forms as required by national competent authorities in the country where each investigational center is located. The investigator is responsible for ensuring the privacy , health, and welfare of the patients during and after the clinical study and must ensure that trained personnel are immediatel y available in the event of a medical emergency . The investigator and the involved clinical study personnel must be familiar with the background and requirements of t he study and with the properties of the IMP as described in the IB. The principal investigator at each investigational center has the overall responsibility for the conduct and administration of the clinical study at that investigational center and for con tacts with study management, with the I ndependent Ethics Committee/I nstitutional Review Board (IEC/I RB), and with competent authorities. 1.7. Study Population and Justification The population to be studied includes children and adolescents, 6 through 16 y ears of age, with TS. Per selection criteria, the participants’ tics need to be troublesome and cause distress or impairment based on the assessment of the patient, parent/guardian, and investigator. Based on these criteria, this is a study population in need of treatment. 1.8. Location and Study Duration This study is planned to be conducted in North America, Russia, and Europe, at approximately 50 centers. It is expected to start in January 2018 and have a duration of approximately 15 months. Additional centers will be added, if needed. Expected duration of the study may also be extended dependent on enrollment and other factors."

Overall Design and Sc reening Period This is a Phase 2/3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel group stud y in which patients with tics associated with TS will be invited to participate. Patients who qualify for the study will be centrall y randomized in a 1:1 r atio (stratified by age at baseline [6 to 11 y ears, 12 to 16years]) to receive either TEV -50717 or placebo. Throughout the study , patients will interact regularl y with investigative site personnel, in clinic and b y telephone, for the evaluation of safet y,tic severity , and behavioral status (in clinic only ). The target dose for each patient receiving TEV -50717 will be based on body weight and CYP2D6 impairment status at baseline. Patients will be classified as CYP2D6 impaired if they are receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor or are a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer based on blinded assessment of CYP2D6 genot ype at baseline. CYP2D6 status will be used by Interactive Response Technology (IRT) for randomization into the study . The dose of IMP for each patient will be ti trated to an optimal level followed b y maintenance therap y at that dose. Investigators will be blinded to CYP status, with a dose cap for poor metabolizers prespecified b y the I RT (Table 2). The overall treatment period will be 12 weeks in duration, including a titration period of 7 weeks, a maintenance period of 5 weeks, followed b y a washout period of 1 week. For the YGTSS, input from the caregiver/ad ult is required. For both the TS -PGII and input from the caregiver/adult is permitted. For all other scales, for children 13 y ears of age and under, interviews may be performed separatel y or jointly with the caregiver/adult as appropriate or defin ed by the scale; for children over 13 years of age, caregiver/adult involvement is strongl y encouraged. Questions should be directed to the child, but the caregiver/adult should be encouraged to add relevant information. I t should be noted that the CDI - 2 has individual parent and child questionnaires. Patients who complete the study may be eligible to begin participation in an open -label safet y extension study (TV50717 -CNS - 30047) after the end of the washout period. At the week 13 visit, patients may choose to enter Study TV50717 -CNS -30047 (on that day ), or they will have an additional week to make a decision and return for day 1. Patients not participating in Study TV50717 -CNS -30047 will have a follow -up telephone contact to evaluate safet y 1 week after the end of the washout period (2 weeks after their last dose of IMP). 3.1.2. Screening Period The screening period in this study is up to 31 days. After informed consent/assent, depending on the child’s age, as appropriate, is obtained, patients who are stable from a medical and psychiatric standpoint will undergo a screening evaluation, including medical history , phy sical and neurological examination, laboratory testing, and 12- lead ECG, along with rating scales to assess severit y, frequency, and impairment of tics and comorbid TS sy mptoms and behavioral status."
43,page_43,"Placebo -Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 05 Study TV50717- CNS -30046 43At the discretion of the investigator, the screening visit may be divided into 2 visits if the visit length is felt to be too burdensome for the patient. If the screening visit is divided into 2 visits, the blood sample should be obtained during the first of the 2 visits. Patients who have received comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics (CBIT) for TS or cognitive behavioral therap y (CBT) for obsessive -compulsive disorder (OCD) may participate in this study as long as therap y was completed at least 4 weeks prior to screening. Patients will return to the clinic on day 1 to perform baseline procedures and to reconfirm eligibility . Patients may be rescreened 1 time if there is a change in the status of the patient regarding eligibility for the study . (Note: Details of rescreening must be approved and documented b y the medical monitor and/or Clinical Surveillance and Training [CST] team .) 3.1.3. Titration Period During the titration period (7 weeks), patients who r emain eligible for participation in the study will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio stratified b y age (6 to 11 y ears, 12 to 16 y ears) at the baseline visit (day 1), and that evening (ie, after the study visit) will receive 6 mg of blinded I MP with food. Tablet s should be taken with food (eg, a snack) and should not be taken on an empt y stomach. The titration scheme and maximum dose will be determined b y body weight and CYP2D6 impairment status at baseline, as shown in Table 2. Patients and their caregiver/adult will interact weekl y with the clinical research staff, either b y telephone contact or clinic visit from week 1 through week 7 of the titration period, in order to evaluate safety and establish a dose of IMP that optimally reduces tics and is well tolerated (optimal dose). Safety evaluations during titration include assessment of vital signs, monitoring for adverse events and concomitant medications, 12 -lead ECGs, and rating scales for depression and suicidality . In-person (in- clinic) study visits will be scheduled at weeks 2, 4, and 6, and telephone contacts will be scheduled for weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7 in order to assess tic severit y and adverse events. The dose of the IMP should be increased on a weekl y basis until one of the following criteria is met: The investigator determines that there has been a clinically meaningful reduction in tics,as indicated b y a sustained reduction in the TS -CGI The patient ex periences a protocol- defined “clinically significant” adverse event (defined as an adverse event that is related to study medication and is either moderate or severe in intensity or meets the criteria for a serious adverse event). The maximum allowable dose is reached, based on the patient’s weight and CYP2D6 impairment status at baseline. Although dose adjustments can be made up to and including the week 7 telephone call, if a stable dose is reached before then, the patient should continue on that dose (ie , the dose should not be increased further) for the remainder of the titration period and throughout maintenance dosing, unless there is a change in sy mptoms during the titration period. If a patient experiences a “clinically significant” adverse event attributable to the I MP, the investigator will determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary . If the determination that a patient requires a dose reduction or suspension is made during a telephone contact, an unscheduled clinic visit should be cond ucted as soon as practicable thereafter. Dose adjustments should be made based on all available information, including the patient and caregiver/adult reports of adverse event s and tic reduction, the clinical assessment of safet y and"

At the end of the titration period, the patient’s dose will be established for the maintenance period. 3.1.4. Maintenance Period During the maintenance period (5 weeks), patients will continue to receive their maintenance dose, although dose reductions for adverse events are allowed. Patients will return to the clinic at weeks 9 and 12 for assessments of safety and efficacy. At week 12, patients will undergo a complete evaluation, including ph ysical and neurological examination, safety laboratory testing, 12-lead ECG, CDI -2, and C -SSRS assessments, as well as the YGTSS, TS -CGI, TS -PGII, , , and C&A -GTS -QOL. In addition, patients will undergo pharmacokinetic sampling at week 12. 3.1.5. Washout Period and Follow -up All patients will discontinue IMP at the week 12 visit and will return 1 week later for evaluation of safet y and tic reduction (week 13). Patients who com plete the study may be eligible to begin participation in the open -label safet y extension study TV50717 -CNS -30047. For this study , the follow - up period is defined as 1 week of washout for patients who will participate in the open -label safet y extension study TV50717- CNS -30047 and 2 weeks after the last dose of IMP (1week after the end of the washout period) for patients who will not roll over into the open -label safet y extension study TV50717- CNS -30047. At the week 13 visit, patients may choose to enter St udyTV50717 -CNS -30047 (on that day ), or they will have an additional week to make a decision and return for day 1. Patients not participating in Study TV50717 -CNS -30047 will have a follow -up telephone contact to evaluate safet y 1 week after the end of the washout period (2 weeks after their last dose of IMP). Prohibited drugs will remain the same during the washout period for patients who will participate in the open- label extension study TV50717- CNS -30047. Patients who will not participate in the extensio n study (Study TV50717- CNS -30047) may begin/resume tic therap y medication after the first week of the washout period. See Table 1for study procedures and assessments . See Figure 1for stud y schema."

Justification for Study Design At the present time, effective treatment options for TS are suboptimal and limited. As a chronic condition impairing major life activities during childhoo d, such as occupational, social, and educational activities, TS presents an area of significant unmet medical need in the pediatric population. Preliminary efficacy and safet y data for TEV -50717 as a treatment for TS have been generated in an open -label, P hase 1b pilot study (Study SD-809-C-17). Results of Study SD-809-C- 17 supported further development of TEV -50717 as a treatment of TS. Consequently , the standard placebo -controlled, double -blind study design (TEV -50717 versus placebo in a 1:1 ratio) was chosen for the next study (ie, this Phase 2/3 study) to determine whether IMP treatment results in a statistically significant effect on tics in patients with TS. The justification for the choice of the comparator (placebo) is provided in Section 1.5.2, the choice of dosage is discussed in Section 1.5.1, while the justifications for the choice of the population and the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the stud y are provided in Section 1.7and Section 4.3, respectivel y."

Pharmacok inetic Measures and Time Points Blood samples will be obtained for the measurement of plasma concentrations of TEV - 50717 (deutetrabenazine), α -HTBZ, β -HTBZ, and other metabolites, as needed. Blood sampling for pharmacokinetic anal ysis will be performed at the week 12 visit. Two samples will be collected. The first sample will be collected upon arrival at the clinic. The second sample will be collected 2 to 3 hours after the first pharmacokinetic sample collection. The time between samples should be maximized in order to provide the most useful information. A description of the pharmacokinetic measures is provided in Section 8. 3.6. Randomization and Blinding This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study . Patients will be randoml y assigned to receive treatment with TEV -50717 or matching plac ebo in a 1:1 ratio stratified by age at baseline (6 to 11 years, 12 to 16 y ears). Patients and investigators will remain blinded to treatment assignment during the stud y. Patients will be centrally randomly assigned to the treatment groups by means of a computer-generated randomization list after confirmation of all eligibility criteria. The creation of the randomization list will be under the responsibility and oversight of Syneos Health . In addition, the sponsor’s clinical personnel and all vendors (with exception of the IRT vendor and the bioanal ytical sample anal ysis vendor) involved in the study will be blinded to the I MP identity until the database is locked for anal ysis and t he treatment assignment revealed. After unblinding of this study , the study site may remain blinded to patient treatment assignments until completion of the safet y extension study TV50717 -CNS -30047. The randomization list and treatment will be assigned to the relevant treatment groups through a qualified service provider ( ie, via IRT). The generation of the medication list and management of the IRT s ystem will be done by a qualified service provider under the oversight of Nuvelution TS Pharma ."

Maintenance of Randomization and Blinding 3.7.1. Randomization Patient randomization codes will be maintained in a secure location within Syneos Health, Biometrics. At the time of anal ysis, when treatment codes are needed, the Syneos Health statistician assigned to the study will make a request to unblind and will receive the unblinded codes. 3.7.2. Blinding/Unblinding Pharmacokinetic data may be assessed during the study . For patients who have pharmacokinetic sample bioanal ysis and/or data analy sis conducted, the individuals responsible for sample bioanaly sis and other responsible personnel will know who received IMP and who received placebo during the stud y (of those patients only). Personnel responsible for bioanalysis will be provi ded with the randomization code in order to facilitate the anal ysis. However, the personnel responsible for bioanaly sis and pharmacokinetic data anal ysis will not have access to clinical safet y and efficacy data, will not have an y interaction with study personnel, and will provide concentration data to other personnel in a manner that will not identify individual patients (ie, a dummy patient identifier will be linked to an individual patient’s concentration data). For information about personnel who may be aware of treatment assignments, see Section 3.6. These individuals will not be involved in conduct of any study procedures or assessment of any adverse events . In case of a serious adverse event or pregnancy , or in cases when knowledge of the IMP assignment is needed to make treatment decisions, the investigator may unblind the patient’s IMP assignment as deemed necessary , mainl y in emergency situations. Individual treatment codes, indicating the treatment randomization for each randomized patient, will be available to the investigator(s) and/or pharmacist(s) at the study center via the IRT s ystem. If possible, the sponsor should be notified of the ev ent prior to breaking of the code. If this is not possible, the sponsor should be notified immediately afterwards, and the patient’s drug code assignment should not be revealed. Breaking of the treatment code can alway s be performed by the site without pri or approval by the sponsor. When a blind is broken, the patient will be withdrawn from the stud y, and the event will be recorded onto the case report form (CRF). However, if a patient is unblinded by mistake, the investigator should discuss with the medica l monitor whether or not the patient should be withdrawn. The circumstances leading to the breaking of the code should be fully documented in the investigator’s study files and in the patient’s source documentation. Treatment assignment should not be recor ded in any study documents or source document. In blinded studies, for adverse events that are defined as: suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) (ie, reasonable possibility ; see Section 7.1.4), Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance (GPSP) may independentl y request that the treatment code be revealed (on a case-by-case basis) to comply with regulatory requirements. The report wil l be provided in an"
49,page_49,"Placebo -Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 05 Study TV50717- CNS -30046 49unblinded manner for regulatory submission. If this occurs, blinding will be maintained for the investigator and for other personnel involved in the conduct, anal ysis, and reporting of the data. 3.7.3. Independent Data Monitoring Committee During the conduct of this study , an IDMC will review accumulating safet y data on a regular basis to ensure the continuing safet y of the stud y patients and review of an y study conduct issues. The IDMC will be composed of independent phy sicians with expert ise in the relevant therapeutic field and other relevant experts, such as a statistician. The IDMC will receive safet y data periodicall y which will be presented b y masked treatment groups. They will have the right to recommend modification of the study forsafet y reasons. IDMC sessions can be open or closed. During open sessions, representatives of the sponsor may be present, and information is provided and discussed in a blinded fashion. During closed sessions, the only participants are members of the IDMC and the designated unblinded statistician (if approved to be present). If there is a request to unblind any individual treatment assignment, a written request from the IDMC (as a committee), signed b y the IDMC chairperson, should be made to the unblinded statistician. The appropriate medical and operational personnel will be notified but will not receive the unblinded treatment information. An y use of unblinded treatment assignments should be clearly documented and reported to the sponsor at study termin ation. The IDMC chairperson will communicate with Nuvelution TS Pharma in regard to issues resulting from the conduct and clinical aspects of the study. Nuvelution TS Pharma and Syneos Health will work closel y with the committee to provide the necessary data for review. The conduct and specific details regarding the IDMC sessions and requests to unblind any blinded treatment assignment are outlined in the IDMC charter. 3.8. Drugs Used in the Study 3.8.1. IMP The IMP is a matrix formulation and is designed as a gastro -erosional tablet to be administered with food and should not be taken on an empty stomach. TheIMP is coated with a white polymer coating to aid in swallowing. TEV -50717 tablets have been manufact ured according to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. TEV -50717 tablets are available in the following strengths: 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 mg, all of which are identical in size, shape, and color (white). The IMP will be supplied in 40 -count blist er packs . The placebo tablets and packaging will match those for TEV -50717. Each blister pack (40 -count tablets per dose strength per blister pack) will contain a sufficient supply of drug until the next specified visit/telephone contact, plus overage to a ccount for potential delay s in study visits. A more detailed description of administration procedures is given in Section 5.1."

The packaging will be the same as described for TEV -50717 above. A more detailed description of administration procedures is given in Section 5.1. 3.9. Drug Supply and Accountability 3.9.1. Drug Storage and Security The IMP (TEV -50717 and placebo) should be stored protected from light, at a controlled room temperature, 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); however, storage between 15°C and 20°C (59°F and 68°F) is acceptable if there is no alternative. The IMP should be stored in a dry , securely locked, substantiall y constructed cabinet or enclosure with access limited to authorized staff. 3.9.2. Drug Accountability Each IMP shipment to the site will include a packing slip listing the contents of the shipment, drug return instructions, and an y applicable forms. The investi gator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of IMP and other study materials from the sponsor are correctl y received, recorded, handled and stored safel y and properl y in accordance with the local regulations, and used in accordance with this protocol . A record of IMP accountability (ie, IMP and other materials received, used, retained, returned, or destroy ed) must be prepared and signed by the principal investigator or designee, with an account given for an y discrepancies. Empt y, partially used, and unused IMP will be disposed of, as agreed with the sponsor/development partner. 3.10. Duration of Patient Participation and Justification This study will consist of up to a 31- day screening period, a 12- week double -blind treatment period, and a 1 -week washout pe riod. Patients who complete the study may be eligible to begin participation in an open -label safety extension study TV50717 -CNS -30047 after the end of the washout period. Patients not participating in Study TV50717 -CNS -30047 will have a follow -up telephon e contact to evaluate safety 1 week after the end of the washout period (2 weeks after their last dose of IMP). Patients are expected to participate in this study for its entire duration, which is a minimum of 14weeks. See Section 12.4 for the definition of the end of the stud y. 3.11. Stopping Rules and Discontinuation Criteria There are no formal rules for early termination of this study . During the conduct of the study , serious adverse events will be reviewed (see Section 7.1.5) as they are reported from the investigational center to identify safet y concerns. The study may be terminated by the sponsor at any time. A patient may discontinue participation in the study at an y time for an y reason (eg, lack of efficacy , consent withdrawn, and adverse event). The investigator and/or sponsor can withdraw a"
51,page_51,"Placebo -Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 05 Study TV50717- CNS -30046 51patient from the study at any time for any reason (eg, protocol violation or deviation as defined in Section 11.1.2, noncompliance, or adverse event). Please see Section 4.4for the withdrawal criteria and procedures. 3.12. Source Data Recorded on the Case Report Form All patient data must have supportive original source documentation in the medical records, or equivalent, before they are transcribed onto the CRF. Data may not be recorded directl y onto the CRF and considered as source data unless the sponsor provides written instructions specify ing which data are permitted to be recorded directly onto the CRF, such as eScales. If patient data are processed from other vendors (eg, clinical laboratory , central ECG, diary data), the results will be sent to the investigational center, where they will be retained but not entered into the CRF. These data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing data management) f or direct use with the clinical database (see Section 13.1). All clinical patient data from other vendors will be available to the investigator. The CRFs are filed in the sponsor’s central file after study completion. 3.13.

The investigator should repeat the ECG assessment twice and compare the average of the 2 pre -treatment QTcF values (baseline and screening) to the average of the 3 post- baseline QTcF values. The IMP must be stopped for an y confirmed post -baseline QTcF value >500 msec or increase from baseline >60 msec. g.when a blind is broken due to safet y concerns (see Section 3.7.2 ). If a patient is unblinded by mistake, the investigator should discuss with the medical monitor whether or not the patient should be withdrawn. h. if the investigator or the sponsor determines that the patient is not in compliance with the study protocol, the investigator and the sponsor should determine whether the patient should be withdrawn from the stud y (Section 5.4). In addition, a patient may be withdrawn from the study as described in Sections 3.7, 3.11, 3.13.4, 5.4, and 7.1.7 . Should a patient decide to withdraw after administration of IMP, or should the investigator decide to withdra w the patient, all efforts will be made to complete and report all observations up to the time of withdrawal. A complete final evaluation of the patient’s withdrawal should be made as soon as possible after the last dose of IMP and an explanation given as to why the patient is withdrawing or being withdrawn from the study . Assessments to be conducted at the early termination visit are described in Section 3.13.3.2.2."

Drugs Administered During the Study IMP (see Section 3.8) will be administered as oral tablets at a starting dose of 6 mg. Titration schemes based on body weight at baseline are shown in Table 2. The maximum daily dose is determined b y bod y weight and CYP2D6 impairment status at baseline . Although dose adjustments can be made up to and including the week 7 telephone call, if a stable dose is reached before then, the patient should continue taking that dose for the remainder of the titration period and throughout maintenance dosing. If a p atient experiences a “clinically significant” adverse event that is attributed to the I MP, the investigator will determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary . At the end of the titration period, the patient’s dose will be established for the ma intenance period. If a patient experiences an adverse event during the maintenance period and the investigator believes a dose reduction is warranted, the dose may be reduced. IMP will be dispensed in the clinic. Patients will receive doses for 2 weeks at baseline, week 2, and week 4 visits (current dose level and next dose level) to cover the telephone contacts. At week 6 and week 9 visits, patients will receive doses for 3 weeks. IMP will be administered as follows: IMP should be swallowed whole and take n with food. Tablets should be taken with food (eg, a snack) and should not be taken on an empty stomach. Dosing will be based on body weight and CYP2D6 impairment status at the baseline visit, as shown in Table 2. The starting dose is 6 mg in all patients. Daily doses will be administered twice dail y, approximately 8 to 10 hours apart during the day . A minimum of 6 hours should elapse between doses. If a patient misses a dose and it is within 6 hours of their next dose, the missed dose should be skipped. After week 1, dose increases may not occur more frequentl y than every 5 days. Dose reductions, if required, should be in increments of 6 mg. If more than 1 dose reduction is required for an adverse event, the medical monitor must be notified . During the titration period, the dose of the IMP will be adjusted weekl y according to Table 2to identify a dose level that optimally reduce s tics and is well tolerated. Investigators will be blinded to CYP status, with a dose cap for poor metabolizers prespecified b y the IRT. IMP will be packaged in blister packs and provided for patients to take at home (see Section 3.8)."

Restrictions Medications prohibited before and/or during the study are described in Section 5.3. While patients receiving strong CYP2D6 inhibitors such as paroxetine, fluoxetine, and bupropion at baseline may be enrolled into this study , the addition or removal of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors during treatment is discouraged as this would have an effect on exposure to active circulating drug. If the addition or removal of a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor is required fr om a clinical perspective, the medical monitor should be contacted so an appropriate change in IMP can be made. The use of quinidine and terbinafine are prohibited (see Appendix A, Table 8). Restrictions in regard to sexual activity and required laboratory values are provided in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. As with other VMAT2 inhibitors (tetrabenazine, reserpine), patients should be advised that the concomitant use of alcohol or other sedating drugs with TEV -50717 may have additive effects and cause or worsen somnolence. Given the age of the study population , the use of alcohol during this study is prohibited. Patients should be advised not to drive a car or operate dangerous machinery until they understand how TEV -50717 affects them."
73,page_73,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 05 Study TV50717- CNS -30046 73Use of illicit drugs is prohibited from the time of signing of the informe d consent/assent form and throughout study participation. Patients may not donate blood from the time of informed consent/assent, while taking the IMP, and for 14 day s after the last dose. 5.3. Prior and Concomitant Therapy or Medication Any prior or concomitant therap y, medication, or procedure a patient has had within 3 months before IMP administration and up to the end of the study period, including follow -up, will be recorded on the CRF. Generic or trade name, indication, and dosage will be recorde d. The sponsor will encode all therap y and medication according to the World Health Organization drug dictionary . At each clinic visit after the screening visit, the investigator will ask patients whether they have taken an y medications (other than IMP), i ncluding over -the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal or nutritional supplements, since the previous visit. Parents/patients will be instructed during the course of the study to notify the investigator if any new medication is prescribed, including over -the-counter medications. An y prescribed medication should be reviewed with the investigator. Indication, dosage, and start and end dates should be entered on the CRF. Medications that are allowed, provided that conditions outlined in the table are met, are shown in Appendix A , Table 5. The medical monitor must be contacted if a patient is receiving (or has to begin or stop receiving during the stud y ) a medication that is associated with QTc prolongation or that is a known strong CYP inhibitor. Addition of a strong CYP inhibitor is prohibited. Prohibited medications that are associated with QTc prolongation are listed in Appendix A, Table 6, while prohibited antipsy chotic drugs are listed in Appendix A , Table 7. 5.4. Procedures for Monitoring Patient Compliance The investigator will be responsible for monitoring patient compliance. A check of IMP compliance will be performed during each visit after the initial dispensation of IMP, and IMP accountabili ty records will be completed. If the investigator or the sponsor determines that the patient is not in compliance with the study protocol, the investigator and the sponsor should determine whether the patient should be withdrawn.

Dose Reduction and Temporary IMP Discontinuation Dose Reduction If a patient experiences a “clinically significant” adverse event that is attributed to I MP, the investigator will determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary . Dose adjustments should be made based on all available information, including the p atient and caregiver/adult reports of adverse events and tic reduction, the clinical assessment of safet y and efficacy by the investigator, and information from rating scales. If more than 1 dose reduction is required for an adverse event, the medical monitor must be notified. If the determination that a patient requires a dose reduction or suspension is made during a telephone contact, an unscheduled clinic visit should be conducted as soon as practicable thereafter. Dose Suspension Suspension of study med ication for up to 1 week, if warranted for patient safet y, is allowed. If the patient restarts stud y medication within 7 day s of suspension, the full dose of TEV-50717 may be resumed without titration. Suspensions of study medication for adverse events mus t be reviewed with the medical monitor before therapy is restarted . If a subject’s serum potassium or magnesium were tested and found to be below the lower limit of normal and clinically significant , the laboratory test should be repeated at least once. If the abnormality in the repeated laboratory test is consistent with the prior laboratory test, the IMP must be suspended. The M edical Monitor must be contacted to determine the appropriate investigation and treatment. TEV -50717 may only be restarted once serum potassium or magnesium have normalized. The reason for a dose reduction or suspension must be clearly documented. If a dose reduction or suspension occurs before a scheduled clinic visit, the clinic visit will be postponed so that efficacy evaluation s can be performed at least 5 days after the change. The patients who restart IMP treatment will follow the visit schedule as outlined in Table 1. Patients who withdraw from the study will proceed as described in Section 4.4. 5.6.

ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY Site-administered efficacy scales include the YGTSS and the , and self -administered efficacy scales include the TS -PGII, and C&A -GTS -QOL. 6.1. Primary Efficacy Measure and Justification The prim ary efficacy measure is the TTS of the YGTSS. The YGTSS is administered at screening; baseline; and weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 13: Complete assessment (Checklist and Severity Ratings) at screening, baseline, and weeks 4 and 12 Severity Ratings assessment only at weeks 2, 6, 9, and 13 Input from caregiver/adult is required for all patients irrespective of age. The choice of YGTSS (specificall y the TTS) as a primary efficacy measure is supported by its wide use in clinical practice for evaluation of s ymptoms associated with TS and its successful use in the Phase 1b study SD -809-C- 17 (Section 1.3.2.2). The YGTSS rating scale is a semi -structured clinician rating instrument that provides an evaluation of the number, frequency , intensity , complexity , and interference of motor and phonic tics ( Leckman et al 1989 ). The items pertaining to the tic ratings are scored on 2 subscales: Motor Tics and Vocal Tics. Behaviors are rated on a 6 -point scale. The scale has a look- back period of 1 week. Additionally , the scale assesses the severit y of tics, which includes overall impairment of the patient, and combines motor and visual tic infor mation into a TTS score. A can then be determined by combining the patient’s severit y rating with the TTS. A reference sample is provided in Appendix G. 6.2. Key Secondary Efficacy and Exploratory Measures 6.2.1. Tourette Syndrome –Clinical Global Impression The TS - CGI is administered at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 13. The TS -CGI scale is a 7-point L ikert scale that allows the clinician to use all available information to assess the impact of tics on the patient’s quality of life. The TS -CGI is rated as follows: 1 (normal), 2(borderline), 3 (mild), 4 (moderate), 5 (marked), 6 (severe), and 7 (extreme). A reference sample is provided in Appendix H. 6.2.2. Tourette Syndrome -Patient Global Impression of Impact The TS -PGII is administered at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 13. Input from the caregiver/adult is permitted. The TS - PGII is a single- item questionnaire that asks the patient to assess the degree of impact due to current tics. The TS -PGII uses a 5 -point scale, ranging from not at all (1) to very much (5), to assess overall resp onse to therap y. In general, patient-rated global measures of"
77,page_77,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 05 Study TV50717- CNS -30046 77change have face validity and have been shown to correlate with disability for a number of chronic conditions. 6.2.3. 6.2.4. Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome- Quality of Life Scale The C& A-GTS -QOL is administered at baseline, week 6, and week 12. Children 13 years of age and under may be interviewed separately or jointly with the caregiver/adult as appropriate or defined b y the scale. For children over 13 years of age, caregiver/adult invo lvement is strongl y encouraged. Questions should be directed to the child, but the caregiver/adult should be encouraged to add relevant information. The C&A -GTS -QOL is a 27- item questionnaire specific to TS patients that asks the patient to assess the ext ent to which their quality of life is impacted by their s ymptoms. The C&A -GTS - QOL contains 6 subscales (cognitive, coprophenomena, ps ychological, ph ysical, obsessive - compulsive, and ADL) and uses a 5- point L ikert scale ranging from no problem to extreme problem. Patients will also be asked how satisfied they feel overall with their life at that moment by using a VAS scale between 0 and 100 ( Su et al 2017 ). A reference sample is provided in Appendix K. 6.2.5. 6.2.6."

ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY In this stud y, safety will be assessed b y qualified study personnel by evaluating the following: reported adverse event s,clinical laboratory test results, vital signs measurements, ECG findings, physical examination findings (including body weight a nd height measurements), use of concomitant medication, neurological examination, C- SSRS, and CDI -2. 7.1. Adverse Events 7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can, therefore, be an y unfavorable and unintended ph ysical sign, s ymptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severit y during t he course of thisstudy , or significant worsening of the disease under study or of any concurrent disease, whether or not considered related to the IMP (TEV -50717). A new condition or the worsening of a pre- existing condition will be considered an adverse event . Stable chronic conditions (such as arthritis) that are present before stud y entry and do not worsen during this study will not be considered adverse event s. Accordingl y, an adverse event can include an y of the following: intercurrent illnesses physical injuries events possibly related to concomitant medication significant worsening (change in nature, severit y, or frequency) of the disease under study or other pre-existing conditions (Note: A condition recorded as pre- existing that is intermitten tly symptomatic [eg, headache] and that occurs during thisstudy should be recorded as an adverse event .) drug interactions events occurring during diagnostic procedures or during the washout phase of this study laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient from the study , are associated with clinical signs and sy mptoms or a serious adverse event, or require medical treatment or further diagnostic work- up, or are considered by the investigator to be clinically significant (Note: Abnormal laboratory test results at the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the stud y or receiving study treatment are not considered adverse events.)"
80,page_80,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 05 Study TV50717- CNS -30046 807.1.2. Recording and Reporting Adverse Events For recording of adverse events, the study period is defined for each patient as that time period from signature of the informed consent/assent form to the end of the follow -up period. For this study , the follow- up period for recording of adverse events is defined as 1 week of washout fo r patients who will participate in the open -label safety extension study TV50717 -CNS -30047 and 2weeks after the last dose of IMP for patients who will not roll over into Study TV50717- CNS - 30047. All adverse events that occur during the defined study perio d must be recorded both on the source documentation and the CRF, regardless of the severit y of the event or judged relationship to the I MP. For serious adverse events, the Serious Adverse Event Form must be completed, and the serious adverse event must be reported immediately (see Section 7.1.5.3.1). The investigator does not need to activel y monitor patients for adverse event s after the defined period. Serious adverse event s occurring to a patient after the treatment of that patient has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures described in Section 7.1.5.3.1 . At each contact with the patient, the investigator or design ee must question the patient about adverse events b y asking an open -ended question such as, “Have y ou had any unusual sy mptoms or medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe.” All reported or observed signs and sy mptoms will be recorded individually , except when considered manifestations of a medical condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible. When such a diagnosis is made, all related signs, symptoms, and an y test findings will be recorded collecti vely as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, on the Serious Adverse Event Form. The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until resolved, stabilized, or returned to baseline; until the patient is referred for continued care to a health care professional; or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study procedure is made. The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24 hours), action taken regarding IMP, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be recorded both on the source documentation and the CRF. The relationship of each adverse event to IMP and study procedures, and the severit y and seriousness of each adve rse event, as judged by the investigator, must be recorded as described below. Further details are given in the safet y monitoring plan. 7.1.3. Severity of an Adverse Event The severit y of each adverse event must be recorded as 1 of the following: Mild: No limitation of usual activities Moderate: Some limitation of usual activities Severe: Inability to carry out usual activities"
81,page_81,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 05 Study TV50717- CNS -30046 817.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the IMP The relationship of an adverse event to the IMP is characterized as follows: Term Definition Clarification No reasonable possibility (not related)This category applies to adverse events that, after careful consideration, are clearly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc) or to adverse events that, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged to be unrelated to the IMP.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “no reasonable possibility” if it is clearly due to extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply: It do es not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of the IMP. It could readily have been produced by the patient’s clinical state, environmental, or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient. It does not follow a known pattern of response to the IMP. It does not reappear or w orsen when the IMP is re-administered. Reasonable possibility (related)This category applies to adverse events for which, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, a connection with the administration of IMP cannot be ruled out with certainty.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the following apply: It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP. It cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient. It disappears or decreases on cessation or red uction in dose. There are important exceptions when an adverse event does not disappear after discontinuation of the IMP, yet an IMP relationship clearly exists. It follows a known pattern of response to the IMP. 7.1.5. Serious Adverse Events An additional blood sample for the measurement of IMP concentration should be collected, if possible, from each patient experiencing a serious adverse event leading to discontinuation of IMP at an y time during the study . If study center personnel are unable to obtain a blood sample in a timely fashion, this should be discussed with the medical monitor to determine whether the sample still needs to be obtained. For recording of serious adverse events, the stud y period is defined for each patient as the time period from signatu re of the informed consent/assent form to the end of the follow -up period, as defined in Section 7.1.2. If the investigator becomes aware of serious adverse events occurring in a patient after the end of the follow -up period, the serious adverse events should be reported to the sponsor following the procedures described in Section 7.1.5.3.1."
82,page_82,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 05 Study TV50717- CNS -30046 827.1.5.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at an y dose that results in any of the following outcomes or actions: results in death is a life- threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event); it does not refer to an event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, which means that hospital inpatient admission or prolongation of hospital stay were required for treatment of an adverse event , or that they occurred as a consequence of the event. Hospitalizations scheduled before the patient signed the informed consent form will not be considered serious adverse event s, unless there was worsening of the preexisting condition during the patient’s participation in this study . results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (refers to a substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions) is a congenital anomal y/birth defect an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasi as or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Note: Any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an important medical event. All occurrences of possible drug- induced liver injury that meet Hy ’s law criteria, defined as all of the below, must be reported by the investigator to the sponsor as a serious adverse event: alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increase of >3×the upper limit of normal (ULN) total bilirubin increase of >2 ×ULN absence of initial findings of cholestasis (ie, no substantial increase of alkaline phosphatase [AL P]) An adverse event that does not meet an y of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be regarded as a nonserious adverse event. 7.1.5.2. Expectedness A serious adverse event that is not included in the adverse reaction section of the relevant reference safet y information (RSI ) by its specificity, severit y, outcome, or frequency is considered an u nexpected adverse event . The RSI for this study is the IB."

The sponsor’s GPSP will determine the expectedness for all serious adverse events. For the purpose of SUSAR reporting, the version of the IB at the time of occurrence of the SUSAR applies. 7.1.5.3. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event 7.1.5.3.1. Investigator Responsibility To satisfy regu latory requirements, a ll serious adverse events that occur during the study , regardless of judged relationship to administration of the IMP, must be reported by the investigator according to the instructions provided on the serious adverse event form. The event must be reported within 24 hours of when the investigator learns about it. Completing the Serious A dverse Event Form and reporting the event must not be delay ed, even if not all the information is available. The investigator does not need to activel ymonitor patients for adverse event s once this study has ended. Serious adverse events occurring to a patient after the last administration of I MP of that patient has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them. The serious adverse event form should be sent to the local safet y officer (LSO) or designee (a contract research organization in a country without a sponsor L SO) (contact information is in the Clinical Study Personnel Contact I nformation section); the L SO will forward the report to the sponsor’s GPSP. The following information should be provided to record the event accurately and completel y: study number investigator and investigational center identification patient number onset date and detailed description of adverse event investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the IMP (no reasonable possibility , reasonable possibility ) Additional information includes: age and sex of patient date of first dose of IMP date and amount of last administered dose of IMP action taken outcome, if known severit y explanation of assessment of relatedness"

Additional information (follow -up) about an y serious adverse event unavail able at the initial reporting should be forwarded by the investigator within 24 hours of when it becomes known to the same address as the initial report. For all countries, the sponsor’s GPSP will distribute the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) form/Extensible Markup Language (XML) file to the LSO/ Syneos Health for submission to the competent authorities, IEC/I RBs, and investigators, according to regulations. The investigator must ensure that the IEC/IRB is also informed of the event, in accordance with national and local regulations. Blinding will be maintained for all stud y personnel. Therefore, in case of a SUSAR, only the LSO/ Syneos Health will receive the unblinded report for regulatory submission; the others will receive a blinded report. Note: Although pregnancy is not a serious adverse event , the process for reporting a pregnancy is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event , but using the pregnancy form (see Section 7.3). 7.1.5.3.2. Sponsor Responsibility If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the IMP or s tudy procedures, the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify all investigators participating in sponsored clinical studies of TEV -50717 and the appropriate competent authorities (and I EC/IRB, as appropriate). In addition to notify ing the investigato rs and regulatory authorities (and IEC/I RB, as appropriate), other action may be required, including the following: altering existing research by modify ing the protocol discontinuing or suspending the stud y modify ing the existing consent form and informin g current stud y participants of new findings"

Protocol -Defined Adverse Events of Special Interest No protocol -defined adverse event s of special interest were identified for this study . 7.1.7. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event Any patient who experiences an adverse event may be withdrawn from the study or from study treatment at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor. If a post -baseline QTcF value >500 msec or change from baseline >60 msec is found, the investigator should repeat the ECG assessment twice and compare the average of the 2 pre -treatment QTcF values (baseline and screening) to the average of the 3 post -baseline QTcF values. The IMP must be stopped for any confirmed post -baseline QTcF value >500 msec or increase from baseline >60 msec. If a patient is withdrawn wholly or in part because of an adverse event , both the adverse event s page and termination page of the CRF will be completed at that time. In addition, a blood sample should be obtained for the measurement of IMP concentrations, if possible. The patient will be monitored at the discretion of the investigator (eg, until the event has resolved or stabilized, unt il the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study procedure is made). The investigator must inform the clinical project ph ysician/clinical leader as soon as possible of a ny patients who are being considered for withdrawal due to adverse event (s). Additional reports must be provided when requested. If a patient is withdrawn from the study for multiple reasons that include adverse events, the termination page of the CRF should indicate that the withdrawal was related to an adverse event . An exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an adverse event that, in the opinion of the investigator, is not severe enough to warrant discontinuation but that requires the use of a prohibited medication, thereb y requiring discontinuation of the patient. In such a case, the reason for discontinuation would be need to take a prohibited medication, not the adverse event . 7.1.8. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency , deviations from the protocol may be allowed on a case -by-case basis. To ensure patient safety , after the event has stabilized or treatment has been administered (or both), the investigator or other phy sician in attendance must contact the ph ysician identified in the Clinical Study Personnel Contact Information section of this protocol as soon as possible to discuss the situation. The investigator, in consultation with the sponsor, will decide whether the p atient should continue to participate in the study . 7.2.

Questions should be directed to the child, but the caregiver/adult should be encouraged to add relevant information. The C -SSRS is an interview by trained study personnel. Suicidal ideation Patients with a positive C -SSRS suicidal ideation score on either items 1 or 2 or a change on the CDI -2 Parent or Self -Report Profiles consistent with increasing depressive symptoms must be 1) discussed with the medical monitor, 2) re -evaluated within 2 to 3 days in a clinic visit, a nd 3) treated according to the investigator’s medical judgment. Consultation with a child and adolescent psy chiatrist or licensed child/adolescent mental health provider is advised, followed b y close ongoing monitoring. If patients endorse or report a C- SSRS suicidal ideation level of 3, 4, or 5, subjects will be evaluated immediately b y the stud y investigator and referred for ps ychiatric evaluation. The medical monitor will be immediately consulted. If it is determined by the investigator, after consultation with the medical monitor and the consulting psy chiatrist, that exposure to the I MP may have contributed to this change in C -SSRS and/or increased depressive s ymptoms, IMP will be immediatel y discontinued and the patient terminated from the study . In cases where it is determined that IMP did not contribute to changes in depression or suicidality , the investigator will consult with the medical"

Suicidal behavior Actual attempt: If patients report an y suicidal behavior that is an actual attempt as assessed in the C- SSRS, they will be evaluated immediately by the study investigator, referred for psychiatric evaluation, and terminated from the st udy. Interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, or Preparatory Acts or Behavior: If patients report an y suicidal behavior that is interrupted, aborted, or preparatory as assessed in the C -SSRS, they will be evaluated immediately by the study investigator and referred for ps ychiatric evaluation. I n cases where it is determined in the psy chiatric evaluation that IMP did not contribute to changes in suicidal behavior, the investigator will consult with the medical monitor, the consulting ps ychiatrist, and/or sponsor to determine whether the patient should continue in the study . A reference sample is provided in Appen dixE. 7.2.3. Children’s Depression Inventory, Sec ond Edition The CDI -2 (p arent and s elf-report profiles) is administered at screening, baseline, and weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 13. As the CDI -2 is designed for children 7 to 17 y ears of age, children 6 years of age at baseline will not complete the Self -report version; the caregiver/adult will complete the Parent version. The CDI -2 Self -report is a 28 -item self -report questionnaire assessing depressive sy mptoms in children 7 to 17 y ears of age with basic reading and comprehension skills. In the CDI -2, children are asked to choose 1 of 3 statements that most closely aligns with their feelings in the previous 2weeks. The questionnaire covers both the major and minor sy mptoms of depression as outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision ( Sun and Wang 2015 ). The CDI-2 Parent is a 17 -item questionnaire administered to parents to assess depression- related behaviors observed in their children. In the CDI-2 Parent, parents are asked to rate their child’s behaviors in the past 2 weeks on a 4 -point Likert scale from “no t at all” to “much or most of the time”. The questionnaire allows for the division of depressive s ymptoms into functional problems and emotional problems ( Sun and Wang 2015 ). A reference sample is provided in Appendix D. 7.3. Pregnancy Any female patient becoming pregnant during the study will discontinue IMP. All pregnancies of female patients participating in the study that o ccur during the study , or within 14 days after the end of the study , are to be reported immediatel y to the individual identified in the Clinical Study Personnel Contact Information section of this protocol, and the investigator must provide the sponsor (LS O/Syneos Health) with the completed pregnancy form."
88,page_88,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 05 Study TV50717- CNS -30046 88The process for reporting a pregnancy is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event but using the pregnancy form (see Section 7.1.5.3). The investigator is not required to report patients who are found to be pregnant between screening and baseline, provided no IMP was given. All female patients who become pregnant will be monitored for the outcome of the pregnancy (including spontaneous, elective, or voluntar y abortion) . If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of the infant up to 8weeks of age), including details of birth and presence or absence of an y birth defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be repor ted to the sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy during the study and any complication of pregnancy that the investigator becomes aware of after withdrawal from the study will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as appropriate. If the pregnancy in the female patients participating in the study does not continue to term, 1 of the following actions will be taken: For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event . For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, re port as a serious adverse event . For an elective abortion notdue to developmental anomalies, report on the pregnancy form; do not report as an adverse event . 7.4. Medication Error and Special Situations Related to the Investigational Medicinal Product Any administration of IMP that is not in accordance with the study protocol should be reported on the CRF either as a violation, if it meets the violation criteria specified in the protocol (Section 11.1.2), or as a deviation, in the patients source documents, regardless of whether or not an adverse event occurs as a result. All instances of incorrect medication administration should be categorized on the CRF as “Non -Compliance with I MP”. The following are t ypes of medication errors and special situations: 1.Medication error: An y unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or administration of a medicinal product while in the control of the healthcare pro fessional, patient, or consumer. 2.Overdose: Administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given per administration or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommended dose according to the authorized product information. Clinical judgment should al ways be applied. Any dose of IMP (whether the test IMP or placebo), whether taken intentionally or unintentionally in excess of the dose prescribed, must be immediately reported to the sponsor. 3.Misuse: Situations where the I MP is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with the authorized product information. 4.Abuse: Persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of IMP, which is accompanied by harmful ph ysical or ps ychological effects."

Breastfeeding: Suspected adverse reactions that occur in infants following exposure to a medicinal product from breast milk. 7.5. Clinical Laboratory Tests All clinical laboratory test results outside of the reference range will be judged by the investigator as belonging to one of the following categories: abnormal and not clinically significant abnormal and clinically significant The clinical significance of the laboratory values will be evaluated by the criteria described in the laboratory manual and by the judgement of the investigator. A laboratory test result that is judged b y the investigator as clinicall y significant will be recorded both on the source documentation and the CRF as an adverse event, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2. An event may include a laboratory ordiagnostic test abnormality (once confirmed by repeated testing) that results in the withdrawal of the patient from the study , the temporary or permanent cessation of IMP or medical treatment, or further diagnostic work -up. Abnormal laboratory tests can b e repeated without approval from the medical monitor. (Note: Abnormal laboratory or diagnostic test results at the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the study or receiving IMP are not considered adverse events.) 7.5.1. Serum Chemistry, Hematology, and Urinalysis Clinical laboratory tests (eg, serum chemistry , hematology , urinal ysis) will be performed at the time points detailed in Table 1.

Sample testing results will not be provided to the study team until the study is unblinded. This assessment potentially includes the association anal ysis of th e variation in CYP2D6 gene with clinical treatment responses to the I MP (eg, efficacy , pharmacokinetics, tolerability , and safet y features or disease susceptibility and severity features). See Section 8.3.1 for further details. 7.6. Vital Signs Vital signs (pulse, BP, body temperature, and respiratory rate) will be measured at the time points detailed in Table 1. All vital signs results outside of the reference ranges will be judged b y the investigator as belonging to one of the following categories: abnormal and not clinically significant abnormal and clinically significant Before pulse and BP are measured, the patient must rest in a supine or semi -erect/seated position for at least 5 minutes. (The same position and arm should be used each time vital signs are measured for a given patient). At basel ine, week 4, and week 12, orthostatic BP and pulse will be measured after the patient is in a standing position for at least 3 minutes. Forany abnormal vital sign finding, the measurement should be repeated as soon as possible. Any vital sign value that i s judged b y the investigator as clinically significant will be recorded both on the source documentation and the CRF as an adverse event, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2. 7.7. Electrocardiography A 12 -lead ECG will be conducted at the time points detailed in Table 1. All ECGs will be performed after at least 5 minutes rest in a supine or semi -supine position. A qu alified ph ysician at a central diagnostic center will be interpreting the ECG. All ECG results outside of the reference ranges will be judged by the investigator as belonging to one of the following categories: abnormal and not clinically significant abno rmal and clinically significant Any ECG finding that is judged by the investigator as clinicall y significant (except at the screening visit) will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the source documentation and in the CRF, and monitored as describe d in Section 7.1.2. If a post -baseline QTcF value >500 msec or change from baseline >60 msec is found, the investigator should repeat the ECG assessment twice and compare the average of the 2 pre- treatment QTcF values (baseline and screening) to the average of the 3 post -baseline QTcF values. The IMP must be stopped for an y confirmed post -baseline QTcF value >500 msec or increase from baseline > 60 msec."

Physical Examinations Physical examination, including height and weight, general appearance, skin, head, ey es, ears, nose, throat, neck, l ymph nodes, cardiovascular, respiratory , musculoskeletal, abdominal, and extremities will be performed at thetime points detailed in Table 1. Weight must be measured with shoes and outerwear off. Any physical examination finding that is judged by the investi gator as a clinically significant (except at the screening visit) will be considered an adverse event , recorded on the CRF, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2. 7.9. Assessment of Suicidality TEV -50717 is considered to be CNS -active. In addition, there have been some reports of suicidal ideation or behavior as reported in the product label when it has been given to some patients with certain conditions. The sponsor considers it important to monitor for such events before and during this clinical stud y. Some CNS -active IMPs may be associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation or behavior when given to some patients with certain conditions. Although this I MP or other similar medicinal products in this class have not been shown to be associated with an increased risk of suicidal thinking or behavior when given to this study population, the sponsor considers it important to monitor for such events before or during this clinical study . The study population being admi nistered TEV -50717 should be monitored appropriatel y and observed closely for suicidal ideation and behavior or any other unusual changes in behavior. Consideration should be given to discontinuing TEV-50717 in participants who experience signs of suicidal ideation or behavior and detailed recommendations are provided in Section 7.2.2. Baseline assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior and treatmen t -emergent suicidal ideation and behavior will be assessed during the study using the C -SSRS described in Section 7.2.2. Depression and Suicidality as an Adverse Event Families and caregivers of subjects in Study 30046 will be instructed to monitor patients for an y changes in or new onset of depressive s ymptoms; unusual changes in mood, cognition, or behavior; or onset of and/or changes in suicidal i deation or behavior, and to report such symptoms immediately to the study investigator. Telephone contacts and clinic visits also allow opportunities for investigators to assess adverse events. If a relevant change in status is identified, patients will be seen immediately for an unscheduled visit by the study investigator and discussed with the medical monitor. The patient will be referred for further ps ychiatric evaluation if there is any suspected suicidal ideation with any level of intent, suicidal beha vior, or clinical findings suggesting that the patient may be dangerous to self or others, and/or experiencing depression. The investigator will record these symptoms as an adverse event of depression and/or suicidality . If it is determined by the investig ator, after consultation with the medical monitor and the consulting psy chiatrist, that exposure to the I MP may have contributed to the adverse event of depression or suicidality , IMP will be immediately discontinued and the patient will be terminated from the study .

A reference sample is provided in Appendix E. 7.10. Neurological Examinations Neurological examination, including mental status, cranial nerves, motor system (strength, tone, and posture), coordination, gait and balance, tendon reflexes, and sensation, will be performed at the time points detailed in Table 1. An y neurological examination finding that is judged b y the investigator as a potentially clinicall y significant change (worsening) compared with the screening value will be considered an adverse event , recorded on the CRF, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2 . 7.11. Concomitant Therapy or Medication Concomitant therap y or medication usage will be monitored throughout the study. Parents/patients will be instructed during the course of the study to notify the investigator if any new medication is prescribed/administered, including over -the-counter medic ations. Any prescribed/administered medication should be reviewed with the investigator. Medications that are allowed, provided that conditions outlined in the table are met, are shown in Appendix A , Table 5. The tables of allowed and prohibited medications are not comprehensive and may not include all possible concomitant medications. The medical monitor must be contacted if a patient is receiving (or has to begin or stop receiving during the stud y) a medication that is associated with QTc prolongation or that is a known strong CYP inhibitor. Prohibited medications that are associated w ith QTc prolongation are listed in Appendix A , Table 6, while prohibited antipsy chotic drugs are listed in Appendix A , Table 7. 7.12.

Pharmacok inetic Assessment Blood samples will be obtained for the measurement of plasma concentrations of TEV -50717 (deutetrabenazine) , α-HTBZ, β -HTBZ, and other metabolites, as needed. Blood sampling for pharmacokinetic anal ysis will be performed at the week 12 visit. Two samples will be collected. The first sample will be collected upon arrival at the clinic. The second sample will be collected 2 to 3 hours aft er the first pharmacokinetic sample collection. The time between samples should be maximized in order to provide the most useful information. Patients with early morning visits (ie, within 2 hours of their scheduled AM dosing) should take their dose in the clinic after the first pharmacokinetic sample is collected. Patients will be provided with a diary to provide critical information on dosing before the week 12 visit. The date and time of the last dose of study medication before the week 12 visit should be recorded in the diary by the patient or caregiver/adult. The site will document the date and time of the sample collection. Prior to the clinic visit at week 12, patients will be reminded to record the start time of their last meal and the time of their last dose in their diary . Plasma samples for both α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ metabolites will be pooled with previous data and incorporated into a population pharmacokinetic anal ysis. The population pharmacokinetic analysis will result in a final structural model t hat best describes the data. A covariate assessment will evaluate the relationship between potential covariates (ie, bod y weight, age, height, etc) and concentrations of α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ metabolites. The final population pharmacokinetic analysis will be included in a separate report. Additional details regarding sampling and handling as well as shipment and anal ysis of samples will be provided in the laboratory manual. 8.2. Pharmacodynamics Assessment Exposure -response (eg, pharmacod ynamic [PD] and/or safet y endpoints) may be assessed if the appropriate data are available. 8.3. Pharmacogenetics 8.3.1.

Summaries will be presented b y treatment group. 9.5.4.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis The pr imary anal ysis will be a mixed -model, repeated-measures with the change in the TTS as the dependent variable. The model will include fixed effects for treatment group, week (5levels: weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 ), and the treatment group by week interaction. The baseline TTS , region, and age group at baseline (2 levels: 6 to 11 y ears, 12 to 16 y ears) will be included as covariates. The unstructured covariance matrix for repeated observations within patients will be used. I n case that the model does not converg e, the Maximum -Likelihood estimation method will be used instead of the default Restricted Maximum- Likelihood. If the model still does not converge, then a simpler covariance structure with fewer parameters will be used, according to the following order: H eterogeneous Autoregressive (1), Heterogeneous Compound Sy mmetry , Autoregressive (1), and Compound Sy mmetry . The least squares means of the change in TTS from baseline at week 12 will be compared (the active treatment arm and the placebo arm) using a 2 -sided test at the alpha=0.05 level of significance.

Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations and Violations 11.1.1. Protocol Amendments No changes from the final approved (signed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written approval or favorable opinion of a written amendme nt by the IEC/IRB and national and local competent authorities, as applicable , except when necessary to address immediate safety concerns to the patients or when the change involves only nonsubstantial logistics or administration. The principal investigato r at each investigational center, the coordinating investigator (if applicable), and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment. 11.1.2. Protocol Violations Any deviation from the protocol that affects, to a significant degree, (a) the safet y, ph ysical, or ment al integrit y of the patients of the study and/or (b) the scientific value of the study will be considered a protocol violation. Protocol violations may include non -adherence on the part of the patient, the investigator, or the sponsor to protocol- specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, primary objective variable criteria, or GCP guidelines; noncompliance to IMP administration; use of prohibited medications. Protocol violations will be identified and recorded b y investigational center personnel in a log o r as part of the CRF. All protocol violations will be reported to the responsible IEC/IRB, as required. When a protocol violation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to discontinue the patient from the study or permit the patient to continue in the study , with documented approval from the medical expert. The decision will be based on ensuring the safety of the patient and preserving the integrity of the study . Changes in the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the protocol are notprospectivel y granted b y the sponsor. If investigational center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria was entered in a study , they must immediately inform the sponsor of the protocol violation. I f such patient has alre ady completed the study or has withdrawn earl y, no action will be taken but the violation will be recorded. 11.2. Information to Study Personnel The investigator is responsible for giving information about the study to all personnel members involved in the study or in any element of patient management, both before starting the study and during the course of the study (eg, when new personnel become involved). The investigator must ensure that all stud y personnel are qualified b y education, experience, and training to perform their specific task. These study personnel members must be listed on the investigational center authorization form, which includes a clear description of each personnel member’s responsibilities. This list must be updated throughout the study , as necessary . The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study personnel, including the investigator, and for ensuring they comply with the protocol. Additional information will be"

Study Monitoring To ensure compliance with GCP guidelines, the study monitor or representative is responsible for ensuring that patients h ave signed the informed consent form, and the study is conducted according to applicable Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), the protocol, and other written instructions and regulatory guidelines. The study monitor is the primary association between the sponsor and the investigator. The main responsibilities of the study monitor are to visit the investigator before, during, and after the study to ensure adherence to the protocol; that all data are correctl y and completely recorded and reported; and that informed consent/assent, depending on the child’s age, as appropriate, is obtained and recorded for all patients before they participate in the study and when changes to the consent form are warranted, in accordance with I EC/IRB approvals. The study monitor will contact the investigator and visit the investigational center at regular intervals throughout the study . The stud y monitor will be permitted to check and verify the various records (CRFs and other pertinent source data records, including specific ele ctronic source document [see Section 3.12]) relating to the study to verify adherence to the protocol and to ensure the completeness, consistency , and accuracy of the data being recorded. If electronic CRFs are used for the study , the study monitor will indicate verification by electronically apply ing source document verification flags to the CRF and will ensure that all required electronic signatures are being implemented accordingl y. As part of the supervision of study prog ress, other sponsor personnel may , on request, accompan y the study monitor on visits to the investigational center. The investigator and assisting personnel must agree to cooperate with the study monitor to resolve any problems, errors, or possible misunderstandings concerning the findings detected in the course of these monitoring visits or provided in follow- up written communication. 11.4. Clinical Product Complaints A clinical product complaint is defined as a problem or potential problem with the phy sical quality or characteristics of clinical drug supplies or clinical device supplies used in a clinical research stud y sponsored by Teva. Examples of a product complaint include but are not limited to: suspected contamination questionable stability (eg, color change, flaking, crumbling, etc) defective components missing or extra units (eg, primary container is received at the investigational center with more or less than the designated number of units inside) incorrect packaging, or incorrect or missing labeling/ labels unexpected or unanticipated taste or odor, or both"
105,page_105,"Placebo- Controlled Study –Tourette Sy ndrome Clinical Study Protocol with Amendment 05 Study TV50717- CNS -30046 105device not working correctly or appears defective in some manner Each investigational center will be responsible for reporting a possible clinical product complaint by completing the product complaint form provided by Teva and emailing it to within 48 hours of becoming aware of the issue. For complaints involving a device or other retrievable item, it is required that the device (or item) be sent back t o the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. For complaints involving a drug product, all relevant samples (eg, the remainder of the patient’s drug supply ) should be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. 11.4.1. Product Complaint Information Needed from the Investigational Center In the event that the product complaint form cannot be completed, the investigator will obtain the following information, as available: investigational center number and principal investi gator name name, phone number, and address of the source of the complaint clinical protocol number patient identifier (patient study number) and corresponding visit numbers, if applicable patient number, blister pack, and kit numbers (if applicable) for do uble-blind studies product available for return Yes/No product was taken or used according to protocol Yes/No description or nature of complaint associated serious adverse event Yes/No clinical supplies unblinded (for blinded studies) Yes/No date and name of person receiving the complaint Note: Reporting a product complaint must not be delay ed even if not all the required information can be obtained immediately . Known information must be reported immediately . The sponsor will collaborate with the investigat or to obtain an y outstanding information. 11.4.2. Handling of IMP at the Investigational Center The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from the investigator’s clinical study supplies. The sponsor may request th at the investigator return the product for further evaluation and/or anal ysis. If this is necessary , the clinical study monitor or designee will provide the information needed for returning the IMP. If it is determined that the investigational center must return all I MP, the sponsor will provide the information needed to handle the return."

Data Collection Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study . The data collected on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management s ystem (CDMS) that meets the technical requirements described in 21CFR Part11. The CDMS will be fully validated to ensure that it meets the scientific, regulatory , and logistical requirements of the study before it is used to capture data from this study . Before using the CDMS, all users will receive training on the system and study -specific training. After they are trained, use rs will be provided with individual system access rights. Data will be collected at the investigational center by appropriatel y designated and trained personnel, and CRFs must be completed for each patient who provided informed consent/assent. Patient identity should not be discernible from the data provided on the CRF. Data will be verified b y the stud y monitor using the data source, and reviewed for consistency b y Data Management using both automated logical checks and manual review. All data collected wi ll be approved b y the investigator at the investigational center. This approval acknowledges the investigator’s review and acceptance of the data as being complete and accurate. If data are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanal ytical laboratory , central ECG center, diary data, electronic patient -reported outcome [ePRO] Tablet), the results will be sent to the investigational center, where they will be retained but not entered in the CRF, unless otherwise specified in the protocol. These data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing data management) for direct entry in the clinical database. Laboratory test results will not be entered in the CRF unless otherwise specified in the protocol. A ll data from other sources will be available to the investigators. For patients who enter a study but do not meet entry criteria, at a minimum, data for screening failure reason, demography , and adverse event s from the time of informed consent/assent will be entered in the CRF. 13.2. Data Quality C ontrol Data Management is responsible for the accuracy , quality , completeness, and internal consistency of the data from this study . Data handling, including data quality control, will comply with international regulatory guidelines, including ICH GCP guidelines. Data management and control processes specific to this study , along with all steps and actions taken regarding data management and data quality control, will be described in a data management plan. CRFs received will be processed and reviewed for completeness, consistency , and the presence of mandatory values. Applicable terms will be coded according to the coding conventions for this study . Logical checks will be implemented to ensure data quality and accuracy . Any necessary changes will be made in the clinical database, and data review and validation procedures will be repeated as needed. Data from external sources will be compared with the information available in the CDMS. Discrepancies found will be queried."

Ame ndment 01 Dated 22 June 2017 The primary reason for this amendment is to change aspects of the conduct, concomitant mediations, titration instructions, sample size, acceptable contraceptive methods, analy sis of the data, and clinical stud y personnel. This amendment is considered to be substantial (ie, requires approval by CA, IEC, and/or IRB) by the sponsor’s Authorized Representative. Other nonsubstantial changes have been made to the protocol (and protocol s ynopsis, as appropriate). These changes are unlikely to affect the safety or rights (ph ysical or mental integrit y) of the patients in this clinical study or the scientific value of the clinical stud y.

Furthermore, TEV 50717 has the same mechanism of action and indistinguishable pharmacology as tetrabenazine, an agent that is generally accepted among movement disorder experts to provide clinical benefit in this patient population ( Jankovic and Kurlan 2011 ). Based on the nonclinical data discussed above and similar efficacy observed for tetrabenaz ine and TEV 50717 in studies of other indications (see Additional information regarding benefits and risks to patients may be found in the current IB and in the United States prescribing information for AUSTED O™ (deutetrabenazine).The section was modified to reflect accurate information regarding known and potential benefits and risks to patients."

Potential Risks of TEV 50717 The following information is based on clinical trial experience with TEV 50717 and the United States prescribing information for Xenazine (tetrabenazine): TEV 50717 is contraindicated in patients who are actively su icidal, or in patients with untreated or inadequately treated depression. TEV 50717 is contraindicated in patients with impaired hepatic function. TEV 50717 is contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). TEV 50717 should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within a minimum of 14 days of discontinuing therapy with an MAOI. TEV 50717 is contraindicated in patients taking reserpine. At least 21 days should elapse after stopping reserpine before starting TEV 50717. Additiona l information regarding each potential issue may be found in the current IB. 1.4.2. Overall Risk and Benefit Assessment for This Study There is a significant need to identify new treatments for TS that do not antagonize dopamine receptors, as these latter agents pose serious risks such as metabolic syndrome and TD, a movement disorder that is often irreversible. The results from Study SD 809 C 17 demonstrated meaningful efficacy in the context of good tolerability and no signal on safety scales, vital signs, laboratory parameters, or 12 lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). These findings are consistent with results in other study populations, such as HD, where the rates for TEV 50717 and placebo were similar for overall adverse events, neurologic and psychiatric adverse events, as well as dose reduction or dose suspension for adverse events (see IB for details)."

Male contraception: Male patients must always use a condom, except in cases of no genotoxicity; or no demonstrated or suspected human teratogenicity/fetotoxicity. Vasectomy: Use of contraceptive methods applies also to vasectomized men, because of the risk asso ciated with transfer of a drug via seminal fluid.

Amendment 02 Dated 03 October 2017 The primary reason for this amendment is to incorporate CYP2D6 genot yping results into the IRT in order to allow for a dose cap to be applied in a blinded manner, update drug packaging to ensure blinding of CYP2D6 impairment status, reorder the statistic al testing methodology (ie, the inclusion of TS- PGII assessment after TS -CGI and before the C&A -GTS -QOL ADL subscale), clarify the study day window for each visit or call, and include prohibited medications that are associated with QTc prolongation. This a mendment is considered to be substantial (ie, requires approval by Competent Authority , IEC, and/or IRB) by the sponsor’s Authorized Representative.

Titration schemes based on body weight at baseline are shown in Table 2. The maximum daily dose is determined by body weight a nd CYP2D6 impairment status at baseline and any use of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (see Table 3) . Although dose adjustments can be made up to and including the week 7 telephone call, if a stable dose is reached before then, the patient should continue taking that dose for the remainder of the titration period and throughout maintenance dosing. If a patient experiences a “clinically significant” adverse e vent that is attributed to the IMP, the investigator will determine if a dose reduction or suspension is necessary. At the end of the titration period, the patient’s dose will be established for the maintenance period. If a patient experiences an adverse e vent during the maintenance period and the investigator believes a dose reduction is warranted, the dose may be reduced. IMP will be dispensed in the clinic. Patients will receive doses for 2 weeks at baseline, week 2, and week 4 visits (current dose level and next dose level) to cover the telephone contacts.

The potential for increased sensitivity to the effects of TEV -50717 in pediatric patients is mitigated by two factors. First, the effects of TEV -50717 on behavior and weight gain recovered with cessation of test article Nonclinical background information addition."

Second, the clinical significance of tremors and reduced body weight gain in rats dosed with TEV -50717 are unclear because these findings were not adverse events of note in adults or adolescent patients. While hypoactivity has the potential to relate to clinical observations of somnolence, this adverse effect is controlled with dose reduction.
