Generalized pustular psor iasis is a severe, debilitating, and life-threatening systemic inflammatory disease ( Marrakchi 2011, Benjegerdes 2016 ). The interleukin-36 (IL-36) pathway, by promoting inflammatory responses, has been s hown to play a key role in pathogenesis of GPP. In individuals with a normal IL-36/interleukin-36 receptor (IL- 36R) axis, the action of the IL-36 cytokines is counter-balanced by IL-36Ra, an IL-36 receptor ant agonist. This natural antagonist reduces excessive IL-36 response by blocking the binding of IL-36 agonist ligands to the IL-36R . Several studies have identified IL-36RN mutations, the gene cod ing for IL-36Ra, in a subset of GPP patients (Marrakchi 2011; Onoufriadis 2011; Sugiura 2012; Capon 2013, Na varini 2017) . These mutations disrupt the inhibitory function of IL-36Ra, leading to uncontro lled IL-36R activation. Other genetic defects have also been associated with GPP, including mutations in the AP1S3 and CARD14 genes (Mahil 2016; Jordan 2012; Farooq 2013 ). Regardless of the presence of known mutations, activation of IL-36 pathway has been associated with sustained inflammatory respons e in GPP suggesting a key role of IL-36 in inflammatory skin diseases. Currently, there is no approved and registered marketed therapy for GPP. Present treatment options are limited to existing plaque psoriasis and systemic immunomodulat ory therapies, which have limited efficacy in GPP ( Benjegerdes 2016) . The investigational product, ANB019, is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that specifically binds to IL-36R and antagonizes IL-36 sig naling. Therefore, inhibition of IL-36 signaling by blocking IL-36R may provide a novel strategy to co ntrol the pathological inflammatory cascade driven by the IL-36 pathway in patients with GPP. The inf ormation obtained from this study may provide important insights into potential new treatment options for GPP."

The IL-36 cytokines (IL-36α, IL -36β, and IL -36γ) engage with IL-36R to initiate signaling events leading to pro-inflammatory responses. IL-36 signaling is counter balanced by IL-36Ra, an IL-36 receptor antagonist that binds to IL-36R and competes with activity of I L-36 cytokines. Mutations in the gene encoding the IL-36Ra ( IL-36RN ) result in uncontrolled activation of the IL-36 pathway leading to the development of generalized pustular psoriasis (G PP), a severe and life-threatening disease ( Marrakchi 2011, Benjegerdes 2016 ). As such, inhibition of IL-36 signaling, by targeting IL-36R with a specific mAb, may represent a novel strategy to c ontrol the pathological inflammatory cascade driven by the IL-36 pathway activation. AN B019 is being developed as a potential first-in-class therapy for GPP, palmoplantar pustular psoriasis (PPP), and other inflammatory diseases where the IL-36 pathway might play a patho genic role. 2.1 Study Rationale This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mu ltiple doses of ANB019 in subjects with GPP. Generalized pustular psoriasis is a severe, deb ilitating, and life-threatening systemic inflammatory disease ( Marrakchi 2011, Benjegerdes 2016 ). Skin lesions manifest with widespread sterile pustules on ery thematous skin over large BSA s. Skin rash is accompanied by high fever, general malaise, leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and frequently includes functional extracutaneous organ involvement that might lead to mortality ( Marrakchi 2011 ). The IL-36 is associated with acute and chronic inflammation a nd has been shown to play a key role in pathogenesis of GPP. Several studies have identif ied GPP-associated IL-36RN in a subset of GPP patients ( Marrakchi 2011; Onoufriadis 20 11; Sugiura 2012; Capon 2013, Nav arini 2017 ). These mutations disrupt the inhibitory function of IL-36Ra, l eading to uncontrolled IL-36R activation. Other genetic defects have also been associat ed with GPP, including mutations in the AP1S3 and CARD14 genes ( Mahil 2016; Jordan 2012; Farooq 2013 ). Regardless of mutations, activation of the IL-36 pathway has been associate d with a sustained inflammatory response in pustular psoriasis suggesting a key role of IL-36 in inflammatory skin diseases. Currently there is no approved therapy for GPP. Treatment optio ns are limited to existing plaque psoriasis (PP) and systemic immunomodulatory therapies, which have limited and inconsistent efficacy ( Benjegerdes 2016) . ANB019 is an mAb that specifically binds the IL-36R and antagonizes IL-36 signaling. Therefore, inhibition of IL-36 sign aling by blocking IL-36R may provide a novel strategy to control the pathological inflammato ry cascade driven by IL-36 pathway in patients with pustular psoriasis. The information obta ined from this study is considered important for future clinical practice as it may pro vide important insights into potential new treatment options for GPP."
16,page_16,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol ANB019-002 –Amendment 5 29 October 2019 172.2 Background Generalized pustular psoriasis is a severe inflammatory skin dise ase characterized by the presence of widespread pustules covering almost the entire body along with systemic inflammatory manifestations, such as fever, leukocytosis, and el evated CRP. Generalized pustular psoriasis is a rare disease in the US, and although the exact prevalence has not been fully estimated, it is considered to affect only a few thousand individuals. The prevalence of GPP has been studie d in Japan and France and repo rted as approximately 7.46 and 1.76 cases per million of the population, respectively ( Ohkawara 1996; Augey 2006 ). Although GPP has been associated with psoriasis, it is considered as a d istinct disease entity based on different pathological pathways. Several studies have identifie d GPP-associated IL-36RN mutations in a subset of GPP patients ( Marrakchi 2011; Onoufriadis 2011; Sugiura 2012; Capon 2013, Navarini 2017 ). These mutations disrupt the inhibitory function of IL-36Ra, l eading to uncontrolled IL-36R activatio n. While a significant proportio n of GPP cases are associated with deficiency of IL-36Ra, also known as DITRA, approximately 5 1% to 84% of patients reported no mutation of the IL-36RN . Other genetic defects have also been associated with GPP, including mutations in the AP1S3 and CARD14 genes ( Mahil 2016; Jordan 2012; Ohkawara 1996 ). Regardless of the presence of kn own mutations, activation of IL-36 pathway has been associated with sustained inflamma tory response in GPP suggesti ng a key role of IL-36 in inflammatory skin diseases. There is no effective and approv ed treatment for GPP. Recurrent flares are common, even years after diagnosis (Benjegerdes 2016, Oji 2015, Navarini 2017) . Patients often require continued systemic immunomodulatory therapy causing significant and severe AEs. Therefore, inhibition of IL-36 by targeting the IL-36R with ANB019 will control excess ive activation of the IL-36 pathway and potentially offer a novel and effective treatment f or patients with GPP. 2.2.1 Nonclinical Studies ANB019 has strong inhibitory activity of human as well as the cyno molgus monkey IL-36R. Nonclinical data obtained from studies with ANB019 in primary h uman and cynomolgus monkey cells and from in vivo non-human primate studies demonstra ted that: xANB019 shows reactivity with human and cynomolgus monkey IL -36R ( dissociation constant ), but not with mouse or rat IL -36R. xIn primary human and cynomolgus monkey cell populations, kerati nocytes, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human whole blood, ANB019 inhibits IL-36R- mediated release of interleukin-8 (IL-8). xThe observed serum half-life of ANB019 in cynomolgus monkeys was 304 hours after single IV dose administration, and 310 hours after single SC dose admin istration at 10 mg/kg, with"
17,page_17,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol ANB019-002 –Amendment 5 29 October 2019 18bioavailability approximately 76% consistent with the anticipat ed PK characteristics for a human IgG4 scaffold mAb in the monkey. xRepeat-dose, Good Laboratory Practice toxicity and toxicokinetic studies of 4 and 13 weeks in duration have been co nducted with ANB019 administered by wee kly SC and IV injection to cynomolgus monkeys. There were only minor treatment-related injection site findings in the 4-week repeat-dose study. Tr eatment-related effects in the 13-week toxicity study included increased observations of nonformed feces and prolapsed rectum, and protozoa in the stomachs of monkeys, the latter being consistent with the m echanism of action of an immune-modulator in cynomolgus monkeys ( Augey 2006 ). These studies established a no observed adverse effect level for males at 60 mg/kg/dose adminis tered IV and for females at 60 mg/kg/dose administered SC after 13 weeks of dosing. 2.2.2 Clinical Studies ANB019-001, a first in human Phase I study in healthy subjects and subjects with psoriasis has been conducted (ANB019-001 2018). The Single Ascending Dose (SAD) part of the study enrolled 48 hea lthy adults and has been completed. Six dose levels were administered to 8 subjects in e ach cohort: 10 mg, 40 mg, 100 mg, 300 mg, and 750 mg by IV injection and 100 mg by SC injecti on. After single dose administration, ANB019 was genera lly well tolerated in male and female healthy adults 18-43 years old. Overall, 40 subjects (83%) experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE). The percentage of subjects who experienced at lea st 1 TEAE was similar across treatment groups: 29 subjects, 81% in ANB019 group and 11 subject s, 92% in placebo. The most commonly reported AEs were upper respiratory tract infection (U RTI) (28% ANB019, 50% placebo), headache (28% ANB019, 25% placebo), viral URTI (11% AN B019, 8% placebo), oropharyngeal pain (8% ANB019, 0% placebo), nausea (8 % ANB019, 0% placebo), tension headache (6% ANB019, 8% placebo), gastroenter itis (6% ANB019, 0% placebo), herpes simplex (6% ANB019, 0% placebo), acne (6% ANB019 , 0% placebo), and catheter site pain (6% ANB019, 0% placebo). All other SAEs occurre d as single events. The majority of TEAEs were mild (73%) and moderate (26%) in severity w ith exception of 1 severe AE of elevated creatine kinase deemed unrelated to study treatme nt. No subject discontinued the study due to AE. There were no SAEs reported in the SAD portion of the study. No clinically relevant abnormalities were noted in vital signs, physical exam inations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), or laboratory parameters. One subject with PP was enrolled and completed the study as per pr otocol. This subject received a single dose of 750 mg by IV injection. The PP cohort was remove d from the study and no further subjects were enrolled. N o TEAEs were reported for the su bject with PP in the SAD part of the study."
18,page_18,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol ANB019-002 –Amendment 5 29 October 2019 19The Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) part of the study enrolled 24 hea lthy adults. Three dose levels were administered to 8 subjects in each cohort: 40 mg, 100 mg, and 300 mg by IV infusion once a week for 4 weeks. In each cohort, 6 of 8 subjects received ANB019 and 2 subjects received placebo. In the MAD part of the study, 19 of 24 subjects (79%) experienced at least 1 TEAE. Overall, ANB019 was generally well tolerated in healthy adults (20 to 37 years old). The TEAEs were reported by 16 of 18 subjects (89%) in the ANB01 9 treatment group and in 3 of 6 subjects (50%) in the placebo group following IV infusion o nce a week for 4 weeks. The most common TEAEs were headache (39% ANB019, 17% placebo) and upp er respiratory tract infection (17% ANB019, 17% placebo). The majority of AEs were mi ld (83%) and moderate (17%) in severity with no severe events reported. There was no AE leading to study treatment withdrawal reported. One subject developed AE of neutropenia 7 days after the last dose of ANB019 100 mg IV with absolute neutrophil count of 0.7 × 109/L (previously 2.3 × 109/L on Day1, 2.1 × 109/L on Day 7, 2.0 × 109/L on Day 14, and 2.0 × 109/L on Day 21). The subject was completely well and asymptomatic with no recent illness reported. All other laboratory parameters were normal. The absolute neutrophil count returned to within the normal range 4 days later (3.1 × 109/L) and the subject completed the study. The AE was assessed by the Investigator as moderate and related to study treatment. There were no SAEs reported in the MAD part of the study. No mean ingful trends were observed in vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, or laborato ry parameters. The PK data generated after either a single or multiple IV dose administration indicated linear PK with area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) increasing in a generally dose proportionate manner . The mean m aximum observed concentration (Cmax)was following a single maximum dose of following a single administration. The Cmaxincreased with weekly IV dosing indicating accumulation during the 4-week dosing period. However, there was little change in serum c oncentration on Day 29 compared with predose Day 22, indicating that steady state had been achieved after 4 weekly doses. T he terminal half -life of ANB019 was approximately 597 hours after SC injection and between after IV injection . 2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment Subjects with GPP may or may not receive direct benefit from par ticipating in this study. Details about specific benefits and risks for participants in this clini cal trial can be found in the Investigator ’s Brochure (IB) and ICF. The safety profile of ANB019 in humans is limited. ANB019 was well tolerated in heal thy male and female adults, an d in 1 subject with PP, in first in human Phase I study (Australian Study ANB019-001) when administ ered as single or multiple doses, up to 100 mg by SC and 750 mg by IV injection. Overall summ aries of TEAEs by severity and relationship showed no marked differences between treatments (ANB019 versus"
19,page_19,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol ANB019-002 –Amendment 5 29 October 2019 20placebo) and no apparent dose-relat ed trends in subjects follow ing ANB019 administration. Commonly occurring TEAEs of headache and upper respiratory tract infection occurred in both the SAD and MAD parts of the study. There were no death or serio us adverse events (SAEs) and no subjects withdrawn due to TEAEs. There has been 1 SAE of sepsis reported in the ongoing ANB019-0 02 study that was considered possibly related to the study drug. The subject had a medical h istory of sepsis and experienced the SAE after the 750 mg IV dose administration. Antibiotic tre atment rapidly resolved the sepsis episode with com plete patient recovery. No major toxicities were observed i n the 4-week, repeat-dose tox icity study. The main finding consisted of minor, non-adverse, i njection site reactions assoc iated with the SC route of administration. Treatment-related effects observed in the 13-week, repeat-dose t oxicity study included protozoa in the stomach, an increase in nonformed feces and prolapsed rect um observations, the latter was not dose-related. The increase i n protozoa in the stomach has b een observed in monkeys treated with immune-modulating drugs ( Augey 2006 ) and is consistent with the putative mechanism of action of ANB019. The increased incidence of protozoa, nonforme d feces and prolapsed rectum were not considered adverse as they responded to veterinarian i ntervention. Gastrointestinal infections are clinically moni torable and, in the case of most protozoa, are readily treatable even in the context of immunocompromised individuals ( Farthing 2006 ). One female monkey receiving 60 mg/kg ANB019 IV was found moribund on Study Day 34. The cause of the moribund nature was not determine d and had an uncertain relatio nship to ANB019 but could be due to treatment-related immune -modulation. However, data publi shed on IL-36 R deficient humans shows no deleterious effec t on general health and normal immune function broadly preserved, indicating that inhibition of IL-36 R, apart from dis ease modification, does not compromise host defenses. Similar to other immune-modulating tr eatment paradigms, subjects should be closely monitored for any gastrointestinal clinical m anifestations including infections and evaluated on ongoing basis. If a gastrointestinal infection is suspected, the subject should be treated as clinically indicated. As allergic or anaphylactic reactions may occur in subjects treat ed with mAbs, subjects should be observed during and after study drug administration. Subjects with true allergic/anaphylactic reactions should not receive further doses of the product. As ANB019 is an mAb, based on clinical studies with other mAbs, st udy participants may experience symptoms of an apparent allergic reaction to the dru g, also know n as ‘cytokine release syndrome .’The symptoms of this vary dramatically but can include: xMild to moderate fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting."
20,page_20,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol ANB019-002 –Amendment 5 29 October 2019 21xModerate to severe signs and symptoms such as edema, hypotension, and pulmonary infiltrates (eg, blood and mucus in the lung). Such reactions should be managed as clinically indicated and ac cording to standard clinical practice."

23,page_23,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol ANB019-002 –Amendment 5 29 October 2019 244.0 STUDY DESIGN 4.1 Overall Design This is an open-label, single arm, multiple dose study to assess the clinical efficacy, as well as the safety, tolerability, and PK of multiple doses of ANB019 in subj ects with GPP. The screening period will be up to 42 days (6 weeks) prior to admin istration of study drug on Day 1. Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject prior to initiating any study related procedures. All screening procedures will be conducted i n accordance with the Schedule of Activities (see Section 1.3). On Day 1, subjects who meet the entry criteria will receive a 750 mg I V dose of ANB019 in an open-label manner followed by 3 doses of 100 mg SC administered o n Days 29, 57, and 85. Subjects will leave the study center after completion of the 5 hour s postdose assessments following IV administration and the 3 hours postdose assessments after the first and second SC injections and with the Investigator ’s approval. Subjects with any ongoing AEs or SAEs at the time of scheduled discharge from the study center should remain at the study center until the Investigator has determined that these events have resolved or ar e deemed as not clinically significant. After completing Day 1 assessments, the subjects will return to t he study center for follow-up visits on Days 3, 8, weekly from Day 8 to Day 29, and every other week up to Day 85, and monthly for 12 weeks to monitor changes in disease activity, saf ety, and tolerability. In addition, subjects will be contacted via phone by study staff to assess fo r safety (eg, AEs and changes in concomitant medications) on Days 36, 50, 64, and 78. Subjects who are nonresponders wil l be early terminated 4 weeks after the 750 mg IV dose administration. A nonresponder is defined as: x“No change” on CGI: 0 points change in JDA total score and not meeting “other criteria” for minimally improved. x“Worsened” based on CGI: ≥ 1-point increase in JDA total score. Disease activity (response to study treatment) will be evaluate d using the CGI scale according to the modified JDA severity index, change in total BSA as measured b y modified JDA index affected by GPP, systemic manifestations and laboratory finding s as per modified JDA severity index, GPPPGA scale, and PASI sc ore (if PP is present). In additi on, change in serum cytokines (including but not limited to IL-8) will be recorded. Quality of life (QoL) will be assessed using theDLQI. Serum samples for PK and immunogenicity will be collected before the administration of ANB019 and at the other time point s specified in the Schedule o f Activities (see Section 1.3). Refer to Table 2 for additional information on sample collection and time points. All subjects"
24,page_24,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol ANB019-002 –Amendment 5 29 October 2019 25enrolled in the study will be ask ed to participate in the skin biopsy and/or genetic analysis; however, participation is optional and subjects will be asked to give specific consent for these assessments. Safety assessments including AE/SAE monitoring, vital signs meas urements, physical examination, ECGs, laboratory measurements, and urine assessmen ts will be performed during the study. The EOS visit will be on Day 169 and all subjects will return to t he study center for the EOS procedures (see Section 1.3). 4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design Currently there are no approved treatment modalities for use in subjects with GPP, and there is little evidence-based information to guide the management of th is severe, life-threatening type of psoriasis. In this context, the development of agents with new mechanisms of action is considered important for future clinical pract ice. This open-label single a rm multiple dose study may provide evidence-based information about the clinical effect of this novel treatment. 4.3 Justification for Dose ANB019 will be administered as a single IV dose of 750 mg follow ed by 3 doses of 100 mg SC administered on Days 29, 57, and 85. The doses selected for this study have demonstrated favorable saf ety profile and prolonged pharmacodynamic activity in a Phase I study (ANB019-001). A loadin g dose of 750 mg IV will be administered on Day 1 to enable steady state concentration to be reached faster at initiation of the ANB019 l00 mg SC dose. The 12-w eek treatment duration is expe cted to provide adequate time to assess the safety and efficacy of ANB019 in subjects wit h GPP. 4.4 End of Study Definition A subject is considered to have completed the study if they have co mpleted all protocol specified visits including the last visit on Day 169 (see Section 1.3). The EOS is defined as the date of the last visit of the last sub ject in the study. 4.5 Study Stopping Criteria 4.5.1 Stopping Criteria for Individual Subjects Dosing for any individual subject will be stopped if the subjec t experiences a SAE or a clinically significant possibly drug related AE, which in the opinion of t he study physician, Investigator, or Sponsor’s medical representative, warrants discontinuation of the study for that subjec t’s wellbeing. Details on subject withdrawal are presented in Sectio n 7.0."
25,page_25,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol ANB019-002 –Amendment 5 29 October 2019 264.5.2 Criteria for Stopping the Study Termination of a study may occur upon decision of the Sponsor, upon decision of the Investigator, by request of an authority, because of withdrawal of a positive vote by the responsible Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Re view Board (IRB); or if new safety or efficacy information leads to an unfavorable risk-bene fit judgment for any trial medication. The Sponsor may discontinue the trial if it becomes unjustifiable for medical or ethical reasons, for poor enrollmen t, or because of discontinua tion of clinical development of ANB0019 for safety reasons. Furthermore, the Investigator and/or Sponsor have the right to close a study center, at any time, after consultation between the involved parties. The IEC/IRB, the competent authority and the local authority must be informed within 15 days of a decision being made. The Investigator is obliged to inform the local authority whereas information of the IEC/IRB and competent authority is to be performed b y . If the study center has to be closed prematurely, will provide all essential documents necessary for the Sponsor’s Trial Master File as defined in the Note for Guidance on G ood Clinical Practice (GCP) (CPMP/ICH/135/95). The study will be terminated prematurely in the following cases : xIf SAEs occur resulting in the risk-benefit ratio not being reason able anymore. xIf the pattern of AEs observed in the study interferes signific antly with the risk-benefit evaluation provided to the Investigator prior to the start of th e study. xIf the number of discontinued subjects is so high or the number o f included subjects is so low that proper completion of the study could not realistically be expected. xIf the results of parallel studies show evidence for unacceptab le risks. xIf severe protocol violations and misconduct occur which unacce ptably affect the safety or rights of the subjects, or render questionable the validity o f the study results."

Electronic data capture will be used for this study, meaning tha t all eCRF data will be entered in electronic forms at the study center. Data collection will be c ompleted by authorized study center staff designated by the Investigator. Appropriate training and security measures will be completed with the Investigator a nd all authorized study center staff prior to the study being initiated and any data being entered into the system for any st udy subjects. All data must be entered in English. The eCRFs should always re flect the latest observations on the subjects participating in the stu dy. Therefore, the eCRFs are to be completed as soon as possible during or after the subject ’s visit. To avoid inter-observer variability, every effort should be made to ensure that the same individual who made the initial baseline determinations completes all efficacy and safety evaluations. The Investigator must verify that all data entries in the eCRFs are accurate and correct. If some assessments are not done, or if certain information is not available or not applicable or unknown, the Investigator sho uld indicate this in the eCRF. The Investigator will be required to electronically sign off on the clinical data. The monitor will review the eCRF s and evaluate them for complet eness and consistency. The eCRF will be compared with the source documents to ensure that there are no discrepancies between critical data. All entr ies, corrections and alterations are to be made by the responsible Investigator or his/her designee. The monitor cannot enter data in the eCRFs. Once clinical data of the eCRF have been submitted to t he central server, correcti ons to the data fields will be audit trailed, meaning that the reason for change, the name of the pe rson who performed the change, together with time and date will be logged. Roles and rights of the center staff responsible for entering the clinical data into the eCRF will be determined in advance. If additional corrections are needed, the responsible monitor or Data Manager will raise a query in the EDC application. The appropriate study center staff will answer queries sent to the Investigator. This will be audit trailed by the EDC application meaning that the name of investi gational staff, time and date stamp are captured. The eCRF is essentially considered a data entry form and should not constitute the original (or source) medical records unless otherwise specified. Source docu ments are all documents used by the Investigator or hospital that relate to the subject ’s medical history, that ve rify the existence of the subject, the inclusion and e xclusion criteria and all record s covering the subjec t’s participation in the study. They include but are not limited to laboratory notes, ECG results, memoranda, pharmacy dispensing records, subject files, etc. Sourc e data should be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, accurate, and complete. Cha nges to source data should be traceable, should not obscure the original entry, and should be explained if necessary (eg, via an audit trail)."

These will be made available for inspection by the study monitor at each monitoring visit. Th e Investigator must submit a completed eCRF for each subject who receives study treatment, r egardless of duration. All supportive documentation submitted with the eCRF, such as labor atory or hospital records, should be clearly identified with the study and subject number. A ny personal information, including subject name, should be removed or rendered illegible to preserve individual confidentiality. Electronic case report form records will be automatically appen ded with the identification of the creator, by means of their unique User ID.

If an entry on an eCRF requires change, the correction should be made in accor dance with the relevant software procedures. All changes will be fully recorded in a pr otected audit trail, and a reason for the change will be required. Data Handling and Record Keeping The Investigator must maintain essential study documents (protoc ol and protocol amendments, completed eCRFs, signed ICFs, relevant correspondence, and all other supporting documentation). The study center should plan on retaining such documents for approximately 15 years after study completion. The study center should retain such documents until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 2 years after the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the study tre atment (ANB019). These documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or the hospital, institution, or private practice in which the study is being conducted. Subject identificati on codes (subject names and corres ponding study numbers) will be retained for this same period of time. These documents may be transferred to another responsible party, acceptable to Sponsor, who agrees to abide b y the retention policies. Written notification of transfer must be submitted to Sponsor.

Events Meeting the AE Definition xAny abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chem istry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measureme nts), including those th at worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the Investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease). xExacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing conditio n including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. xNew conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment admi nistration even though it may have been present before the start of the study. xSigns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-d rug interaction. xSigns, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdo se of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose pe r se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. x""Lack of efficacy"" or ""failure of expected pharmacological acti on"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy ass essments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will b e reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE. Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition xAny clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or othe r abnormal safety assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the In vestigator to be more severe than expected for the subject ’s condition. xThe disease/disorder being stud ied or expected progression, sig ns, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the subject ’s condition. xMedical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): th e condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. xSituations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occu r (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). xAnticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected a t the start of the study that do not worsen."
69,page_69,"CONFIDENTIAL Protocol ANB019-002 –Amendment 5 29 October 2019 70Definition of SAE An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at an y dose: a) Results in death b) Is life-threatening The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of “serious” refers to an event i n which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an even t, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. c) Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existin g hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Co mplications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication pro longs hospitalization or fulfil s any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d) Results in persistent disability/incapacity xThe term disability means a substantial di sruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. xThis definition is not intended to include experiences of relat ively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functi ons but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f) Other situations: xMedical or scientific judgment shoul d be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may n ot be immediately life- threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subje ct or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the o ther outcomes listed in the ab ove definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatm ent in an emergency room or at home for allergic bron chospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of d rug dependency or drug abus e."

Ea ch event must be recorded separately. xIt is notacceptable for the Investigator to send photocopies of the subject ’s medical records to Safety in lieu of completion of the /AE/ SAE CRF page. xThere may be instances when cop ies of medical records for certa in cases are requested by Safety . In this case, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the subject number, will be redacted on the copies of the medic al records before submission to Safety . xThe Investigator will attempt to establish a diagno sis of the event based on sig ns, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (n ot the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE report ed during the study and assign it to 1 of the following categories: xMild: An event that is easily tolerated by the subject , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities. xModerate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday activities. xSevere: An event that prev ents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as seve re should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a category utilized for ratin g the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. Assessment of Causality xThe Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. The AE must be ch aracterized as unrelated, possibl y related, and related. o “Unrelated” clinical event with an incom patible time relationship to study drug administration, and that could be explained by an underlying co ndition or other drugs or chemicals or is incontrovertibly not related to the IP o “Possibly related” Clinical event with a reasonab le time relationship to study dru g administration, and th at is unlikely to be attributed t o concurrent condition or othe r drugs or chemicals o“Related” Clinical event with pl ausible time relationship to study drug administration and that cannot be explained by concurren t condition or other drugs or c hemicals xThe Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the rel ationship. xAlternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment ad ministration will be considered and investigated. xThe Investigator will also consult the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. xFor each AE/SAE, the Investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality."
