Amendment 6(06-Feb-2020 ) This amendment is considered to be substantial ba sed on the criteria set forth in Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (65). Overall rationale for the amendment The main reason s for th is amendment are: xTo introduce the possibility for eligible subjects in selected countries of the present LP0162 -1334 trial to continue in a long -term extension trial (conducted under a separate protocol [LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND] ). Eligible subjects from the present trial will be allowed to enter ECZTEND after completion of the treatment period and up to 26 weeks from the ir last investigational medicinal TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 3"

Additional changes included in the amendment are also presented in the table below. The table below presents the changes in each se ction. Changes have either been summarised (written in plain text only) or marked as tracked changes (text adde d to the protocol is written in bold and deleted text has a line through it ). Section no. and name Description of change Brief rationale 1 Protocol synopsis 3 Schematic of trial design 7.1 Trial design The following text has been added (bold) to Section 7.1 Trial design and summarised in Section 1 Protocol synopsis and Section 3 Schematic of trial design: Safety follow -up period (Week 52 to Week 66) After completion of the treatment periods or premature discontinuation of IMP, all subjects will c omplete an off-treatment follow- up period for the assessment of safety, PK, and immunogenicity (i.e. ADA), except subjects who transfer to ECZTEND before Week 66 (see below). During follow -up, subjects will be allowed to receive standard of AD care (excluding biologic therapies) at the investigator’s discretion, if needed. Long -term extension trial (LP0162-1337, ECZTEND) Eligible subjects from selecte d countries may be invited to enter a long -term extension trial conducted under a separate protocol (LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND). Subjects who transfer to ECZTEND, must ha ve had their last visit in the treatment period (Week 52) un der the current protocol (LP0162 -1334). Subjects may ente r ECZTEND up to 26 weeks from their last IMP injection in the present trial (Week 50) to their first IMP injection in ECZTEND (baseline). Subjects may therefore enter ECZTEND (baseline) without completing the safety follow up visit (16weeks after their last IMP injection ) in the present trial, and those subjects will have their safety follow -up visit in ECZTEND.Introduced to allow for subjects in the present trial (LP0162 -1334) to continue in ECZTEND, and to clarify when the subjects can transfer to ECZTEND.

All subjects will have a safety follow -up 16 weeks after last injection of IMP (see Panel 5 ). This is considered the end of trial visit. For subjects who enrol in the long- term extension trial (conducted under a se parate protocol [LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND]), the end of trial visit will be the last visit in the present trial before transfer to ECZTEND (between Week 52 and Week 66); subjects who transfer to ECZTEND before completing the safety follow -up visit in the present trial will have their safety follow -up visit in ECZTEND.To clarify in the trial procedures which visit is considered the end of trial visit for subjec ts who transfer to ECZTEND . 1 Protocol synopsis 7.1 Overall trial design 9.3.1 BlindingThe following text has been added in Section 9.3.1 Blinding and summarised in Section 1 Prot ocol synopsis and Section 7.1 Overall trial design : Analysis of data per last subject’s Week 52 visit To fulfil the commitments in the PIP and the PSP, an analysis of trial data up to and including visit 29 (Week 52) will be performed and will require unblinding of data. To perform this analysis, an analysis group consisting of Clin ical Pharmacologists, Medical Experts, Safety Advisors, Statisticians, Statistical Programmers and Medical Writers will be unblinded to individual subject treatment allocation followi ng database lock for the 52-week data. All staff involved in the conduct of the trial will remain blinded to treatment allocation for the entire duration of the trial. This principle will be applied to all investigator staff and to staff employed by the sponsorexcept for those who are directly involved in the execution of the analysis.To clarify that a n analysis group, not including trial staff or investigatorinvolved in the trial conduct, will be unblinded after all subjects have completed the treatment period and before all subjects have completed the safety follow -up period . 7.3 End of trial definitionA subject is considered to have completed the trial if they have completed all periods of the trial including the final safety follow -up visit at Week 66. Subjects who enter the long- term extension trial (LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND) after completion of the end of treatment visit (Week 52) will also be considered as trial completers.To clarify who will be considered trial completers.

Subjects from selected countries w ho qualify for the long -term extension trial (LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND) may be offered participation (see Sectio n 7.1). To reflect the opportunity to continue in ECZTEND. 11.9 End of trial Added bullet to end of trial form: Has the subject been transferred to the open-label ECZTEND trial (LP0162 -1337)? If yes, which was the last visit (including phone call) th e subject attended in this trial?To clarify how it is to be documented if subjects transfer to ECZTEND. 13.2 Collection of adverse event reportsAEs must be collected from time of first trial- related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent form (ICF) until completion of the clinical trial (defined as the safety follow -up visit 16 weeks after last IMP injection). For subjects entering the long-term extension trial (LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND), any (S)AE with onset before the subject’s final visit in the LP0162 -1334 trial should be reported in the LP0162 -1334 trial. If ongoing, the (S)AE will also be recorded as medical history in ECZTEND.Toclarify the reporting of (S)AEs during transfer from trial LP0162 -1334 to ECTZEND. 13.4.1 Investigator reporting responsibilitiesFor subjects entering the long -term extension trial (LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND), any SAE(s) with onset before the final visit in the present trial, must be reported in the LP0162 -1334 trial eCRF, includ ing any follow-up data requested by Global Safety. SAEs occurring after the completion of the present clinical trial (i.e., after the last safety follow up visit) should not be routinely sought or collected. However, such events should be reported to Global Safety at LE O Pharma (see contact details above) if the investigator becomes aware of them.

In addition, a statement that the SAE has stabilised or is chro nic should be added to the narrative description of the SAE on the SAE form.To provide clarification on how to handle SAEs where the final outcome is recovering/resolving at the end of the trial. 14.3.10 Analysis of data per last subject’s Week 52 visitAddition of a section describing the analysis of data per last subject’s Week 52 visit: To fulfil the commitments in the PIP and the PSP, the trial will be unblinded once all ra ndomised subjects have completed the Week 52 visit. At the cut -off date of the last subject’s Week 52 visit, all efficacy, safety, PK, and ADA data for the treatment periods have been collected and all endpoints used to test pre -specified hypotheses are final. Thus, no adjustments in significance level of the primary and secondary efficacy analys es are relevant. The CTR will include all data from all ra ndomised subjects from the initial, maintenance, and open- label treatment periods and all available data from the safety follow up period as per data cut -off date.To clarify that data will be unblinded (to ana n a l y s i s group), analysed and reported when all subjects have completed the treatment period and before all subjects have completed the safety follow -up period . Appendix 3E: Registration, reporting and publication policyResults of this clinical trial will be posted on the corporate website of LEO Pharma in accordance with LEO Pha rma’s Position on Public Access to Clinical Trial Information no later than 12 months 6 months after trial completion.To clarify that the reporting of the trial results will be 6 months from trial completion as this trial includes adolescent subjects.

The IGA is an instrument used in clinic al trials to rate the severity of the subject's global AD and is based on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). 2. The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD. The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72, with higher values indicating more severe and/or more extensive condition. 3. The SCORAD is a validated tool to evaluate the extent and severity of AD lesions, along with subjective symptoms. The maximum total score is 103, with higher values indicating more severe disease. 4.The Adolescent Pruritus NRS is used by subjects to assess their worst itch over the past 24 hours using an 11- point NRS with 0 indicating 'no itch' and 10 indicating 'worst itch possible'. 5. The CDLQI is a validated questionnaire with content specific to those with dermatology conditions. It consists of 10 items addressing the subject’s perception of the impact of their skin disease on various aspects of their quality of life over the last week such as dermatology- related symptoms and feelings, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep, and the treatment. Each item is scored on a 4- point Likert scale (0 = ‘not at all’; 1=‘only a little’; 2 = ‘quite a lot’; 3 = ‘very much’).

Subjects with missing data and subjects who receive rescue treatment from the Week 2 to Week 16 visit will be considered as non -responders in the analysis.

Reduction of Adolescent Pruritus NRS weekly average of at least 4 from baseline to Week 16 is a binary endpoint, and as such it will be analysed as described for the primary endpoints. Change from baseline to Week 16 in C DLQI will be analysed the same way as change in SCORAD. Testing strategy : The overall type I error rate in the tests of primary and secondary endpoints will be protected by a combination of hierarchical testing and Holm- Bonferroni multiplicity adjustment embedded in a graphical approach. Within each dose level, the 2c o - primary endpoints, IGA 0/1 and EASI75 at Week 16, will be tested hierarchically, followed by a Holm -Bonferroni adjustment of the testing of the 3 secondary endpoints.

In its severe form, AD is characterised by widespread skin lesions, intractable itch, as well as increased susceptibility to bacter ial, viral, and fungal skin infections ( 1-4). AD rash distribution varies with patient age ( 5). In infants <2 years, AD usually involves the scalp, face, neck , and extensor surfaces of th e extremities. In children from 2 years of age to puberty, the flexural surfaces of the extremities, head and neck, and wrists and ankles are more often involved. In adolescents and adults, eczematous changes are typically seen on the head and neck, flexur al surfaces of the extremities, and hands and feet. AD is associated with a substantial patient bur den that typically includes poor quality of life (QoL) and sleep disturbance ( 6). AD is characterised by an activated T -helper -2 (Th2) pathway with increased skin expression of key Th2 cytokines including interleukin (IL) 13 (7, 8). The expression of IL -13 is increased in lesional skin compared to non -lesiona l skin, and the proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ cells expressing IL-13 is upregulated in AD patients comp ared to individuals without AD ( 7, 9). IL-13 acts on keratinocytes to release C -C motif chemokine ligand (CCL) 22 an d recruit more IL-13 expressing Th2 cells, decrease differentiation, and contribute to decreased barrier function ( 10). IL-13 also drives immunoglo bulin E (IgE) production and contributes to mast cell activation status and, once allergen cross -links IgE on the cell surface, drives histamine release and induces itch ( 11, 12). Indeed, itch is a key issue in AD, which drives significant mechanical damage to the skin and further facilitates allergen and pathogen entry. These effects together drive and exacerbate th e disease phenotype. A review of the available preclinical literature from mouse and human ex vivo models suggests IL -13 as a, if not the, central mediator of the AD skin phenotype. Indeed, there is evidence that blocking the IL -4 receptor (which is part o f the receptor complex that also binds IL -13) with the monoclonal antibody dupilumab leads to clinical improvement in subjects with AD ( 13). Even if the clinical manifestations of AD in children and adults are different with regard to the anatomical distribution, IL -13 is an important player in the pathogenesis of AD in both children and adults. Counts of IL -13-positive CD4+ lymphocytes in the perip heral blood of children with AD are significant ly correlated with AD severity (14). Also, increased levels of IL-4 and IL -13 together with eosinophils in blood correlate with disease severity in both paediatric and adult patients with AD (15). Furthermore, IL-4/IL-13 polymorphisms have TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 39"
40,page_40,"Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.0 Page 40 of 182 been shown to be associated with an increa sed incidence of AD in children at age 2 ( 16, 17). Thus, across age groups there is compelling evidence for IL -13 as a central mediator of the AD skin phenotype. 5.2 Experience with investigational medicinal product Tralokinumab is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) subclass that specifically binds to human IL -13 and blocks interactio n with the IL -13 receptors ( 18–20). A compilation of clinical and nonclinical data on tralokinumab including pharmacoki netics (PK) is given in the current version of the investigator ’s brochure. In total, 14 clinical trials with tralokinumab have been completed to date, with phase 3 development ongoing in AD. A phase 2b dose -finding trial has been completed in AD . Other clinical trials with tralokinumab have been conducted in subjects with asthma, ulcerative colitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and in healthy subjects. In a phase 2b trial (D2213C00001), adults with moderate -to-severe AD on a background of mild to moderate topical corticosteroids (TCS) were treated with 3 different regimens of tralokinumab (45 mg every second week [Q2W], 150 mg Q2W, or 300 mg Q2W) or placebo to evaluate the safety and efficacy over a treatment period of 12 weeks. The primary endp oints were change from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) at Week 12 and the percentage of subjects achieving Investigator ’s Global Assessment (IGA) response of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at Week 12. Secondary endpoints included change fr om baseline in EASI and Scoring Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) scores, and the percentage of subjects achieving at least 50% reduction from baseline in EASI and SCORAD scores (EASI50 and SCORAD50). In the overall intent -to-treat phase 2b population, an improve ment in EASI score at Week 12 was seen in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group versus placebo. 26% of subjects achieved an IGA of 0 or 1 in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group versus 12% in the placebo group. The most commonly reported causally related treatmen t-emergent adverse event (AE) was upper respiratory tract infection (6 subjects [3.9%] in the combined tralokinumab group [45 mg, 150 mg, and 300 mg] and 2 subjects [3.9%] in the placebo group). In total, more than 2,3 00 subjects have been treated with tra lokinumab (cut -off date: 18-Aug-2018). Adolescent subjects with asthma have been investigated in a single -dose phase 1 trial (20 adolescent subjects exposed to tralokinumab) as well as in 2 completed phase 3 trials (58adolescent subjects exposed to tralok inumab). In these trials, the tralokinumab PK and safety profile (based on reporting of AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to discontinuation of IMP) was largely similar in the adult and adolescent trial populations with asthma.

Possible risks associated with use of tralokinumab are summarised in Section 5.6. 5.3 Trial rationale AD is a chronic inflammatory skin disease which is more prevalent in children than in adults. No curative treatment of the disease is currentl y available. There is a clear and compelling unmet medical need for mo re effective and safe treatments for moderate -to-severe AD in the paediatric age groups as current immunosuppressive medications, such as cyclosporine, methotrexate, and azathioprine, are associated with long-term toxicities . TCS, especially those of high potency, are associated with a variety of long -term safety concerns, including the systemic effects of absorbed corticosteroids such as adrenal suppression, poor growth, hypertension, hyperglycaemia, insulin resis tance, and cataracts, as well as local skin damage and atrophy. These safety concerns are increased in paediatric patients, whose greater body surface area -to-weight ratio is thought to increase percutaneous absorption ( 21). Furthermore, AD is recognised to cause substantial morbidity and to have a serious impact on the psychological wellbeing and QoL in children ( 22). Also t o fulfil the regulatory requirements under the US Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) (23), the EU regulation on medicinal products for paediatric use (24) and Internationa l Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E11 ( Guideline on the clinical investigation of medicinal products in the p ediatric population) (25), LEO Pharma A/S (hereafter LEO Pharma) is committed to conduct a trial with tralokinumab in adolescent subjects with AD, aged 12 to <18years. Hence, t he present trial is part of the paediatric clinical development programme of tralokinumab for AD, investigating the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab monotherapy in the treatment of adolescent subjects with moderate -to-severe AD who are inadequately controlled with topical therapies. Furthermore, the trial is designed to gain valuable information on the PK of tralokinumab in this population and to select the d oses for a PK/safety trial in younger children ( 2 to <12years). Based on input from the European Medicines Agency ’s (EMA ’s) Paediatric Committee (PDCO), 2 doses of tralokinumab will be evaluated in this trial to assess whether 300 mg or 150 mg tralokinumab would be the optimal dose in the adolescent population. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate whether tralokinumab provides more effective control of the skin manifestations of AD than does placebo. In addition, secondary endpoints addressing symptom scores and extent of AD (SCORAD), itch -related sleep loss and itch severity, and health -related quality of life (H RQoL) measures related to AD are also TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 41"

As AD is a chronic disease requiring long -term treatment, it is also relevant to evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab as maintenance treatment. After the 16 -week initial treatment period, the trial will evaluate 2 differ ent treatment options for maintenance therapy , that is , dosing every 2 (Q2W) or every 4 weeks (Q4W) . Thus, the trial will contribute to th e characterisation of the benefit /risk profile of tralokinumab in the adolescent population. 5.4 Justification for dose The selected dose s for the initial treatment period in this trial is subcutaneously administered 300 mg and 150 mg tralokinumab Q2W. All subjects randomised to receive treatment with tralokinumab will get an initial loading dose on Day 0 (baseline); subjec ts randomised to 300mg will receive a loading dose of 600 mg and subjects randomised to 150 mg will receive 300mg. The administration of the loading dose of tralokinumab will allow systemic concentrations to reach steady state faster, and potentially red uce the time to onset of clinical effect. The serum concentrations of tralokinu mab after the 600 mg loading dose will not exceed the serum tralokinumab concentrations at steady state for the 300 mg Q2W. The 300 mg Q2W dose is also used in the ongoing phase 3 trials in adults. Based on a phase 1 trial in 20 adolescents (12 to 17 years) with asthma (trial CD-RI-CAT-354-1054) , the PK profile of a single SC dose of tralokinumab ( 300 mg ) has been evaluated. Overall, the PK parameters including maximum serum concentration (Cmax), time of maximum serum concentration ( Tmax), and absolute clearance ( CL/F ) were largely similar to that observed in the adult population. Tralokinumab was well tolerated, no serious adverse events ( SAEs ) were reported, and no confirmed anti-drug antibodies ( ADA ) were detected after dosing. Further, t he data from th is phase 1 trial in adolescents with asthma , along with all available adult PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) data, were combined in a population PK -PD model . This model support ed the finding that t ralokinumab PK is dose - linear and stationary with time , and that overall exposure and variability are similar between weight -based and non -weight -based dosing at the dose level of 300 mg Q2W . The PK profile in adult subjects with AD in the phase 2b trial was comparable to the PK profile in adult and adolescent subjects with asthma . Given the relatively shallow dose - TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 42"

In the maintenance treatment period, subjects in 2 of the treatment arms will be dosed with tralokinu mab (either 300 mg or 150 mg) Q4W. This approach will allow the sponsor of the trial, LEO Pharma, to evaluate whether less frequent dosing of tralokinumab (every 4 vs. every 2 weeks) may be sufficient for long-term maintenance of efficacy. 5.5 Ethical consider ations Participation in this trial is voluntary and subjects can withdraw at any time. The subject’s legally authorised representative(s) will give informed consent, and subjects must give their informed consent (assent) as appropriate and according to nat ional laws and regulations. No vulnerable subject incapable of giving informed consent will be enrolled in this clinical trial. Furthermore, female subjects who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or trying to become pregnant will not be enrolled. Female subjects of child bearing potential who are sexually active , must agree to use a highly effective method of c ontraception to prevent pregnancy during the clinical trial and until 16weeks after discontinuation of treatment with the investigational medicinal product (IMP). In additio n, all female subjects of child bearing potential will have a pregnancy test performed before, during , and at end of treatment to ensure that no foetuses are exposed to the IMP. AD is a chronic and recurrent skin disorder and no curative t reatment of the disease is currently available . Further, there is a clear and compelling unmet need for more effective, safe treatments for moderate -to-severe AD in the paediatric age groups. AD is widely prevalent in children including adolescents (26–28). Although AD usually presents as mild disease in the paediatric age group, around 10 -30% of children with AD may have moderate - to-severe disease ( 29–31). AD is recognised to cause substantial morbidity and to have a serious impac t on the psychological wellbeing and QoL in children ( 22). The efficacy of 2 doses of tralokinumab will be evaluated in ad olescent subjects with moderate -to-severe AD who are otherwise healthy. Tralokinumab tr eatment will be compared with placebo control treatment . There are several reasons why this trial is a placebo -controlled monotherapy trial. First, this will allow for a better understanding of the clinical benefits of tralokinumab in adolescents without confoundi ng data interpretation by concomitant use of TCS therapy. Second, the pivotal phase 3 trials in adults are also conducted as monotherapy trials, and the comparison and e xtrapolation of data from the adult to the adolescent population is considered to be most appropriate if the present trial is conducted in the TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 43"

Third, TCS and topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) have limited efficacy in patients with m oderate -to-severe disease. Placebo control was considered to provide the best design for efficient assessment of both benefit and risk in adolescents (12 to <18 years). Recognising that prolonged placebo treatment may not be optimal in this population, a 2 :1 (tralokinumab:placebo) randomisation is planned to increase the opportunity for subjects to receive active treatment. Furthermore, subjects who do not achieve a clinical response at Week 16 (including subjects randomised to placebo) will get the opportu nity to receive open -label tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W treatment with optional use of TCS, if considered appropriate by the investigator. In addition , subjects may receive rescue treatment at the discretion of the investigator if medically necessary (i.e., to control intolerable AD symptoms) through treatment and follow -up. To ensure subject safety, investigators are informed only to enrol subjects they expect can complete wash -out of previous AD medications during the screening period without experiencing intolerable worsening of AD symptoms. In addition, subjects and/or their legally authorised representatives will be informed to contact the investigator, if the subject ’s AD worsens significantly. In accordance with the current version of the ICH Good Clin ical Practice (GCP) guidelines, qualified medical personnel employed by LEO Pharma will be readily available to advise on trial-related medical questions. Medical monitoring will be performed throughout the trial. Safety data will be reviewed regularly by Global Safety at LEO , and by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC , see Appendix 3 H) to ensure that prompt action is taken, if needed, to maximise patient safety. In conclusion, the trial design chosen for this efficacy and safety trial on tralokinumab is regarded as ethically justified and adherent with ethical requirements. 5.6 Benefit/ risk assessment Tralokinumab is a new biological therapy under investigation for the treatment of moderate - to-severe AD in both the adult and paediatric age groups. Based on the benefits in treating AD reported with dupilumab, a m onoclonal antibody that blocks the effects of IL -4 and IL -13 by targeting a common receptor subunit ( 13, 32–34), there is a reasonable expectati on that tralokinumab will prove to be an effective treatment of moderate -to-severe AD.

45,page_45,"Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.0 Page 45 of 182 Tralokinumab has already demonstrated efficacy in moderate -to-severe AD and t he evidence discussed in Section 5.2 further supports the hypothesis that tralokinumab may benefit individuals with AD. An important aspect in the benefit /risk evaluation is the reassuring safety profile of tralokinumab in AD, asthma, ulcerative colitis, idiopa thic pulmonary fibrosis, and in trials with healthy subjects. Throughout an extensive clinical development programme in asthma, no safety concern has been identified with the use of tralokinumab , and tralokinumab w as well tolerated. The AE profile for tralokinumab has been comparable to that for placebo in controlled clinical trials. Injection -site reactions have generally been mild and ADAs have been detected in very few subjects exposed to tralokinumab for up to o ne year ; concerns about neutralising antibodies have not been raised. A number of theoretical potential risks have been identified that are described in the current version of the investigator's brochure, including hypersensitivity reactions, immune comple x disease, severe infections, malignancies, and interference with reproductive function . Measures are in place in this trial to protect participating subjects as follows: xClose monitoring of subjects during the trial with trial visits every 2 weeks during the treatment period as described in the schedule of trial procedures (Section 4). xClose monitoring of subjects during the post dosing period (at th e first 3 IMP dosing visits in the initial treatment period and in open -label treatment ) as a precautionary measure against hypersensi tivity reactions (further details are given in Section 11.4.1 ). xMonitoring of subjects for clinical manifestations that may be associated with the development of specific antibodies to tralokinumab (i.e., immune complex disease). xExclusion of subjects w ith untreated systemic helminth infestations or subjects who have failed to respond to standard of care therapy (neutralisation of IL -13 might theoretically cause a worsening of parasitic infestation, in particular, prevention of expulsion of gastrointesti nal worms (helminths) [ 35]). xExclusion of subjects with a history of tuberculosis requiring treatment within 12 months prior to the screening visit .

In conclusion, previous clinica l experience with tralokinumab shows no major safety or tolerability concerns and appropriate measures have been instituted in this trial to protect subjects from possible risks that have been prev iously identified and to closely monitor each subject. The current benefit/ risk profile is considered favourable and supports the administration of tralokinumab for the purposes of achieving the objectives of this trial.

The trial will consist of a screening period of 2 to 6 weeks (Weeks -6/-2 to 0), an initial treatment period of 16 weeks (Weeks 0 to 16) and a maintenance treatment period of 36 weeks (Weeks 16 to 52). The primary endpoint is assessed at Week 16, and the final efficacy assessment will be cond ucted at Week 52. A14-week follow -up period for the assessment of safety is also included (Weeks 52 to 66) . Subjects who transfer to ECZTEND before completing the safety follow -up visit in the present trial will have their safety follow -up visit in ECZTEN D. Subjects without clinical response at Week 16 , subjects who receive rescue treatment from the Week 2 visit to the Week 16 visit (hereinafter “Week 2 to Week 16”), and subjects who lose their response during the maintenance period will be transferred to open -label treatment (tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W with optional use of TCS and/or TCI ) if they meet certain criteria (see below) , and if considered appropriate by the investigator. Transfer to open -label treatment may occur at any visit from Week 16 while the subject is in the maintenance treatment period. A schematic of the trial design is provided in Panel 1. Screening period (Week -6 to Week 0) Prior to attending any trial procedure, a signed informed consent must be obtained from the subject’s legally authorised representative(s) and from the subject (as appropriate and according to national laws and regulations). The screening period has a mini mum duration of 2 weeks and a maximum duration of 6 weeks and includes 1 or 2 screening visits. The exact duration of the screening period for the individual subject depends on the length of any wash - out period needed (as also specified in the exclusion cr iteria in Section 8.3): x6 weeks for subjects using tanning beds or phototherapy . x4weeks for subjects using systemic immunosuppressive/immunomodulating drugs, systemic corticosteroid use, or ≥3bleach baths during any week within the 4weeks . x2 weeks for subjects using TCS, TCI , or topical phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE -4) inhibitors. If no wash -out or a 2 -week wash -out period is required, screening will be reduced to 2 weeks and reduced to 1 visit (Week -2; visit 2), i.e., the 2 screening visits will be merged.

All subjects will attend a screening visit 14 days before baseline (Week -2; visit 2) where they will receive electronic diary (eDiary) training and start completion of the electronic patient - reported outcome (ePRO ) questionnaires in the eDiary. Data entered into the eDiary during the 2 weeks before randomisation will be used to calculate baseline values of the patient - reported outcomes (PROs). All subjects will use an emollient twice daily (or more, as needed) for at least 14 days before randomisation and will continue this treatment throughout the trial (including safety follow - up). Subjects will initiate emollient treatment no later than the W eek -2 visit. Initial treatment period (Week 0 to Week 16) Following the screening period, approximately 29 4subjects will be randomised 1:1:1 to one of the following groups stratified by region (Europe, North America, Australia, and Japan) and baseline disease severity (IGA of 3 or 4) : xTralokinumab 300 mg Q2W : tralokinumab 600 mg ( loading dose ) at baseline, then tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. xTralokinumab 150 mg Q2W: tralokinumab 300 mg ( loading dose) at baseline, then tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W. xPlacebo Q2W: place bo (loading dose ) at baseline, then placebo Q2W. To ensure blinding, all treatment groups will receive the same number of injections at each visit. Thus, the tralokinumab 150 mg group will receive both tralokinumab and placebo injections at all dosing visits.

During follow -up, subjects will be allowed to receive standard of AD care (excluding biologic therapies) at the investigator ’s discretion, if needed. Long -term extension trial (LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND) Eligible subjects from selected countries may be invited to enter a long -term extension trial conducted under a separate protocol (LP0162 -1337, ECZTEND).

Subjects may enter ECZTEND up to 26 weeks from their last IMP injection in the present trial (Week 50) to their first IMP injection in ECZTEND (baseline). Subjects may therefore enter ECZTEND (baseline) without completing the safety follow up visit (16 weeks after their last IMP injection ) in the present trial, and those subjects will have their safety follow -up visit in ECZTEND.

Each subject will receive 4 SC injections (each of 1mL) to receive a loading dose of tralokinumab or placebo. At subsequent visits in the initial treatment period, each subjec t will receive 2 SC injections (each of 1mL).

The inj ection site must be recorded in the source documents at each treatment visit and re corded in the eCRF. Further details on IMP administration are provided in a n IMP handling manual. IMP administration must be carried out according to these instructions. After IMP administration For the first 3 IMP dosing visits in both the initial treatment period (i.e., Weeks 0, 2, and 4) and in open -label treatment , subjects will be monitored prior to and after IMP administration for immediate drug reactions for a minimum of 2 hours with vital signs taken every 30 minutes or until stable, whicheve r is later . Vital signs will be documented in the eCRF. As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible. The World Allergy Organization has categorised anaphylaxis into 2 subgroups: allergic anaphylaxis (mediated by an immunolo gic mechanism) and nonallergic anaphylaxis (which has a nonimmunologic cause) ( 38). The clinical criteria for defining anaphylaxis for this trial a re listed in Appendix 5 . Appropriate drugs, such as epinephrin e, antihistamines, corticosteroids, etc., and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available at the trial sites, and trial personnel should be trained to recognise and respond to anaphylaxis according to local guidelines. If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, a blood sample will be drawn from the subject as so on as possible after the event, at 60 minutes ± 30 minut es after the event, and at discharge, for analysis of serum tryptase at the central laboratory. Conditions requiring rescheduling of IMP administration If any of the following should occur, the investigator should reschedule the visit and IMP should not be administered until the rescheduled visit: xThe subject has an intercurrent illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, may compromise the safety of the subject in the trial (e.g., viral il lnesses). xThe subject is febrile (defined as ≥38°C) within 72 hours prior to IMP administration.

Subjects eligible for the maintenance part of the trial will be re -randomised to maintenance treatment at Week 16. Subjects randomised to tralokinumab (150 or 300 mg) who have a clinical response at Week 16 (i.e. IGA 0/1 or EASI75 , achieved without use of rescue treatment from Week 2 to Week 16 ), will be re -randomised to the maintenance treatment period at the randomised dose in a 1:1 ratio (tralokinumab Q2W:tralokinumab Q4W) stratified by region and IGA response at Week 16 (IGA 0/1 or IGA >1). Subjects randomised to placebo who have a clinical response at Week 16 (achieved without use of rescue tr eatment from Week 2 to Week 16) will continue on placebo. Subjects who are not eligible for the ma intenance part of the trial will be transferred to open - label tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W treatment (with optional TCS and/or TCI use), if considered appropriate by the investigator . The IRT will be used to control randomisation , re-randomisation, and stratification factors, along with IMP supply chain and expiry tracking. 9.3.1 Blinding This is a double -blinded trial in which tralokinumab and placebo are visually distin ct from each other. Neither the subject nor any of the investigator or LEO Pharma staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation an d monitoring of the subjects will be aware of the treatment received. The packaging and labelling of the IMPs will contain no evidence of their identity. IMP is packed in identical boxes, with non -sequential kit numbers to ensure that unblinding does not occur during shipment and handling of the drug. Since tralokinumab and placebo are visually distinct and not m atched for viscosity, IMP will be handled and administered by a qualified, unbli nded HCP (trained site staff) at the site who will not be involved in the management of trial subjects and who will not perform any of the TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 65"

If needed, the unblinded HCP may perform the safety assessments (except assessment of AEs) for subjects in open -label treatment. If treatment allocation for a subject becomes known to the investigator or other trial staff involved in the management of trial subjects, LEO Pharma must be notified immediately. Should an issue arise with the IMP (e.g., damaged kit or syringe that has been assigned to a subject prior to administration, or any other unex pected event with the kit or syringe [e.g., a malfunction during IMP administration ]), the unblinded HCP at the site will contact the clinical research associate (CRA) to deter mine whether any specific actions are required. See Section 9.10 for details on reporting of product complaints. The trial site will maintain a written plan de tailing which staff members are blinded/unblinded and the process of IMP administration used to maintain the blind. Analysis of data per last subject ’s We ek 52 visit To fulfil the com mitments in the PIP and the PSP, an analysis of trial data up to and including visit 29 (Week 52) will be performed and will require unblinding of data. To perform this analysis, an analysis group consisting of Clinical Pharmacologists, Medical Experts, Safety Advisors, Statisticians, Statistical Programmers and Medical Writers will be unblinded to individual subject treatment allocation following database lock for the 52-week data. All staff involved in the c onduct of the trial will remain blinded to treatment allocation for the entire duration of the trial. This principle will be applied to all investigator staff and to staff employed by the sponsor except for those who are directly involved in the execution of the analysis. 9.3.2 Emergency unblinding of individual subject treatment While the safety of a subject always comes first, it is still important to carefully consider if unblinding is necessary to ensure a subject ’s safety. An emergency unblinding request can be made by the investigators, HCPs who are not members of the trial staff, or authorised LEO Pharma personnel. Provisions are in place for 24 -hour emergency unblinding of individual subject treatment. If emergency unblinding is required, the investigator can unblind a subject ’s treatment in the IRT. For a requester who is not a member of the trial staff and who does not have access to the IRT (e.g., a physician at an emergency room), a local contact number for the emergency unblinding contract research org anisation (CRO) is provided on the subject card (see Appendix 3B) to be used if the investigator or de legated site staff cannot be reached.

The emergency unblinding CRO will clarify that the requester requires immediate unblinding without further medical consultation. Should the requester wish to discuss whether unblinding is necessary, the emergency unblinding CRO will divert the requester to the medical cover. 9.4 Background treatment All subjects must use an emollient twice daily (or more, as needed) for at least 14 days before randomisation; the background treatment should preferably be an additive free, basic bland emollient. Subjects must continue their b ackground emollient treatment throughout the trial. 9.5 Rescue treatment If medically necessary (i.e., to control intolerable AD sympto ms), rescue treatment for AD may be provided to trial subjects at the discretion of the investigator. Prohibited medications and procedures are described in Section 9.7. Subjects who receive topical rescue treatment (TCS of any WHO class [see Appendix 6 ], or TCI) will continue treatment with IMP. If possible, investigators should attempt to limit the first step of rescue treatment to topical treatments , and escalate to systemic treatments only for subjects who do not respond adequately after at least 14 days of to pical treatment. However, systemic rescue treatment may be instituted immediately, if considered appropriate by the investigator. If a subject receives rescue treatment with systemic corticosteroids or non -steroidal systemic immunosuppressive drugs (cyclos porine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, azathioprine, etc.), IMP will be immediately discontinued (see Section 10.2.2 , reasons for temporary discontinuation of IMP). After the treatment wi th these medications is completed, IMP may be resumed if deemed appropriate by the investigator, but not sooner than 5 half -lives after the last dose of systemic rescue treatment . The u se of biological rescue treatment will be disallowed for the entire trial duration. Investigators should make every attempt to conduct efficacy and safety assessments (at least disease severity scores [IGA and EASI], concomitant medications/procedures, and AEs) immediately before administering any rescue treatment. An unscheduled visit may be used for this purpose, if necessary. TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 67"

In order to obtain the most representative efficacy evaluation of tralokinumab in adolescents, it is key to assess the effi cacy status of each trial participant at the planned primary endpoint visit (nominal Week 16 visit [visit 11x, Panel 2]), irrespective of whether the subject has discontinued IMP or not. Therefore, permanent discontinuation of IMP is evaluated as a separate occurrence that does not necessitate that the subject also withdraw s from the trial . This is to enable selected subsequent trial visit s to be conducted, including the nominal Week 16 visit (if discontinuation of IMP occurs prior to Week 16). Hence, permanent discontinuation of IMP and withdrawal from trial are considered to be 2(potentially ) separate occurrences : xPermanent discontinuation of IMP occurs when all further trial treatment is stopped. The subject will continue to participate in selected trial visit activities as outlined in Section 10.2.1 . xWithdrawal from trial occurs when stop of all trial activities takes place before the last planned safety follow -up visit (Week 66 ). This may either happen at the time of permanent discontinuation of IMP or later. Subjects who permanently disco ntinue IMP and subjects who withdraw from the trial will not be replaced. 10.2 IMP discontinuation rules 10.2.1 Reasons for permanent discontinuation of IMP Subjects will permanently disco ntinue IMP in the event of: xAnaphylactic reaction or other severe systemic reaction to IMP injection. xAn AE that, in the opinion of the investigator or sponsor ’s medical expert, contraindicates further dosing.

The trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab versus placebo in adolescent subjects with moderate -to-severe AD. The trial endpoints have been selected to evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab in improving the severity and extent of AD including both objective signs of disease and subjective symptoms (e.g. itch) as well as HRQoL . The planned trial design is considered appropriate for evaluating the trial objectives, as the double -blind conditions regarding the subject ’s treatment (tralokinumab or placebo) are maintained and the possible observer bias regarding treatment effects are minimised. Stratification by region (Europe , North America , Australia , and Japan ) and baseline disea se severity (IGA 3 or 4) in this multi -centre trial will provide a strong basis for generalisation of the findings to the target patient population. Further, the trial population will comprise male and female subjects to explore differences in effects betw een genders and across the adolescent age range. By using a placebo -controlled parallel -group design for the initial treatment period, superiority of tralokinumab to placebo can be investigated and will allow for a better understanding of tralokinumab effi cacy in relation to PK in adolescents. This contrasts with a design where tralokinumab is used as add -on to best standard of care (e.g. TCS) where there will be confounding influence by the concom itant therapy on the efficacy assessments, particularly in c ase of unbalanced use. Precise dose -finding is essential because going forward unnecessary exposure should be avoided in adolescents and because the PK modelling also guides dose -selection for younger age groups in future paediatric trials with tralokinuma b. The most important inclusion criterion for entry into the trial is a diagnosis of AD (as defined by the Hanifin and Rajka 1980 criteria for AD) ( 36) at screening and a history of AD for at least one year, to ensure correct diagnosis and rule out differential diagnosis. A prerequisite for inclusion into the trial is a documented history of topical AD treatment failure (due to inadequate response), to ensure that the subject is candidate for systemic treatment.

Appropriateness of assessments The clinical efficacy of tralokinumab treatme nt will be assessed by IGA, EASI, and SCORAD: xIGA is a key instrument used in clinical trials to rate the severity of the subject ’s global AD. xEASI is a validated measure used i n clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD ( 41). xSCORAD is a validated tool to assess the extent and severity of AD lesions and subjective symptoms ( 43). The efficacy endpoints IGA score of 0 or 1 and EASI75 are recognised as important endpoints in clinical trials in AD by regulators in the US , EU, and Japan . Several validated patient -reported questionnaires (CDLQI, POEM, HADS) have been included to assess the efficacy of tralokinumab on patient -reported outcomes and HRQoL . Blood concentrations of tralokinumab will be analysed using validated bioanalytical methods and standard PK parameters will be derived to evaluate the tralokinumab exposure in adolescents . The pharmacodynamic effect of tralokinumab tr eatment will be assessed using established assays to quantify serum levels of selected cytokines (IL -22 and CCL17) as well as IgE. In this trial, biomarker mRNA expression will be analysed from blood mononuclear cells to assess the response to treatment and to id entify new biomarkers of relevance for AD. In patients with AD, cytokine mRNA in blood mononuclear cells has been shown to be differentially expressed compared to healthy subjects (55). Normal skin is colonised by a wide variety of microorganisms, including fungi, viruses, and bacteria. The skin microbiome is complex and diverse, and varies between individuals and anatomical sites ( 56). Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonisation has been proposed to play a key role in AD pathophysiology via bacterial production of specific virulence factors (57). Resolution of active disease in AD in response to therapy correlates with reduction of S.aureus colonisation and increases in microbiome diversity ( 58).

This method was also used i n the tralokinumab phase 2b trial in adult subjects with moderate -to-severe AD to demonstrate that the frequency of subjects testing positive for S.aureus was lower following treatment with tralokinumab compared with placebo. Global analyses of microbiome diversity will also be incl uded in a phase 3 trial in adults (LP0162 -1325) , with results expected in 2019. The present trial will , if considered appropriate, also use gene sequencing to identify specifi c microbial strains present on the skin and further characterise the treatment ef fects on the skin microbiome in adolescent subjects with AD. AD is a recurrent form of dermatitis where subjec ts have a high susceptibility to itching and irritants or allergens even on non -lesional skin, which is characterised clinically by atopic dry skin and functionally by cutaneous barrier disrupt ion and water deficiency. Previous studies have shown that the barrier -disrupted dry skin of AD patients mainly is attributable to significantly decreased levels of ceramides in the stratum corneum ( 59). Skin barrier function will be assessed (in a subgroup of subjects) us ing skin tape stripping and TEWL. The skin tape stripping is a minimally invasive me thod that has been used for assessment of b iomarkers reflecting the integrity of the skin barrier in AD patients ( 60, 61) as well as for obtain ing information about the inflammatory processes in the skin of AD patients ( 62). TEWL is a method used for assessing t he impaired cutaneous permeabili ty barrier of the stratum corneum in AD skin (60, 63). Systemic treatment of AD has been shown to improve the barrier integrity by decreasing TEWL ( 64). Data on antibodies against tralokinumab (ADAs) will be collected and the potential for immunogenicity will be evaluated until 16 week s after the last dose of tralokinumab, to ensure adequate wash -out (approximately 5 times the half -life). The serum samples for determination of presence or absence ADA will be analysed using a validated bioanalytical method. Safety will be assessed using standard clinical methods of subject evalu ations, such as AE monitoring, ECG, vital sign and clinical laboratory measurements.

The sample size is chosen to provide a sufficient power for demonstrating efficacy of tralokinumab versus placebo for the primary endpoints. Under the assumption that the IGA 0/1 responder rates at Week 16 for the tralokinumab 300mg dose and placebo are 30% and 10%, respecti vely, the power to detect a difference between tralokinumab 300 mg and placebo will be approximately 94% at a 2 -sided 5.0% significance level. Further , assuming corresponding responder rates of 40% and 15% for EASI 75 at Week 16 will imply a nominal power of approximately 98% to detect a difference between tralokinumab 300 mg and placebo for that endpoint. The combined power for detecting a difference between tralokinumab 300 mg and placebo in both primary endpoints at a 5.0% significance level is then at least 92%. For the tralokinumab 150 mg dose, the accumulated power for subsequently rejecting the 2hypotheses of no difference to placebo for the primary IGA 0/1 and EASI75 endpoints at a 2.5% significance level bec omes approx imately 84% and 80%, when using the same assumptions as for the tralokinumab 300 mg dose. 14.2 Trial analysis sets All screened subjects will be accounted for in the CTR. All subjects randomised to initial treatment will be included in the full analysis set and will be analysed for efficacy. Exclusions from the full analysis set can be considered in special cases as described in ICH E9, Section 5.2.1., Full Analysis Set. If it is decided to exclude a randomised subject from the full analysis set, a justification addressing ICH E9 will be given. A per protocol analysis set will be used as an efficacy subset for the analysis of the primary endpoints up to Week 16 (visit 11), and analyses based on the per protocol analysis set w ill be performed to support the results obtained for the full analysis set. The per protocol analysis set will be defined by excluding subjects from the full analysis set for whom any of the following conditions apply: TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 107"

The applied estimands incorporate 2 main types of events that influence how the treatment effects are estimated: xInitiation of rescue treatment : Some of the estimands use rescue treatment (from the Week 2 visit to the Week 16 visit [hereinafter “Week 2 to Week 16 ”]) as an event that modifies the applied value of an endpoint, e.g. by defining a subject receiving rescue treatment as a non -responder. xPermanent discontinuation of IMP : This event occurs when a subject is permanently withdrawn from the treatment or the trial as described in Section 10.2.1 . This can either happen at his/her own initiative or at the investigator's discretion. The event also i ncludes the possibility of a subject being lost to follow -up. The timing of the event is defined as the date of the early termination visit for withdrawn subjects or , in the case of a subject lost to follow -up, the date of the last known visit to the clini c. As for the rescue treatment , the event type is used to modify an applied endpoint value. All analyses will be based on the full analysis set unless otherwise specified. 14.3.5.1.2 Primary estimand: ‘composite ’ The primary estimand for the primary endpoints will be : xTreatment difference in response rates of IGA 0/1 and EASI75 after 16 weeks achieved without rescue treatment from Week 2 to Week 16 , regardless of treatment discontinuation. The primary estimand assesses the expected difference in response rates at Week 16 (defined as response obtained without use of rescue treatment from Week 2 to Week 16), resulting from initiation of a treatment regimen with tralokinumab 300 mg or 150 mg compared to a treatment regimen with placebo.

Subjects who prior to the Week 16 visit have received rescue treatment from Week 2 to Week 16 will be considered n on-responders, reflecting an assumption that use of rescue treatment from Week 2 indicates failure of the randomised treatment to achieve response, and that a (possible) observed positive response after use of rescue treatment is not attributable to the ra ndomised treatment. Missing data for subjects who did not attend the Week 16 visit and where rescue treatment has not been used prior to Week 16, will be imputed as non -responders. The difference in response rates between the active tralokinumab arms and p lacebo will be analysed separately for each of the tralokinumab dose groups using the Cochran -Mantel - Haenszel test stratified by region ( Europe, North America, Australia , and Japan ) and baseline disease severity (IGA 3 or 4). The treatment estimate s and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals ( CIs) will be presented. The null hypothesis of no difference in response rates between either tralokinumab dose and placebo will be tested against the 2 -sided alternative that there is a difference. The prim ary endpoints will be tested sequentially according to the test procedure outlined in Section 14.3.4 . Sensitivity analyses for the primary estimand 2 sensitivity analyses are specified for the primary estimand. In both cases , the same Cochran - Mantel -Haenszel test as used for the primary analysis will be applied including stratification by region and baseline disease severity. The purpose of the analyses is to assess the robustness of results of the primary analysis with respect to the retrieved data at Week 16 a nd assumptions regarding missing Week 16 data. Sensitivity analysis 1 : All subjects who have permanently discontinued IMP prior to Week 1 6 will be imputed as non -responders, even if no rescue treatment has been used. This is to reflect a situation where retrieved efficacy data and concomitant medications could be registered less accurately for subject s who have discontinued treatment. Sensi tivity analysis 2 : Rather than imputing all subjects who do not attend the Week 16 visit and where rescue treatment has not been used as non -responders, the following approach will be applied. If subjects have withdrawn due to an AE or due to lack of effic acy, they are still considered non -responders.

The estimates and standard errors from the 100analyses will for each comparison be pooled to one estimated treatment difference and associated standard error using Rubin ’s rule to draw inference. From these pooled estimates, the 95% CI for the treatment difference will be calculated. Sensitivity analysis for the secondary estimand Rather than assuming that observations are missing at random within each treatment arm, it is assumed that missing data from subjects who discontinue IMP permanent ly or receive rescue treatment in the tralokinumab arm s will resemble missing data from subjects in the placebo arm who do not discontinue IMP permanently or receive rescue treatment . The underlying assumption is that the effect of tralokinumab following rescue treatment or permanent treatment discontinuation is similar to th e effect of placebo. It should be not ed that this assumption is pronouncedly conservative in favou r of placebo as it tends to minimise the differences between treatment arms. Imputation of missing data at Week 16 will be done using a pattern mixture model where missing data in the tralokinumab arm s as well as the placebo arm will be imputed from observed data in the placebo arm (using a so -called copy -reference approach). With this exemp tion, the stepwise multiple imputation proce dure and subsequent analysis will be conducted in the same way as specified for the primary analysis of the secondary estimand. 14.3.5.1.4 Tertiary estimand: ‘treatment policy ’ The tertiary estimand for the primary endpoint s will be: xTreatment difference in response rate after 16 weeks between tralokinumab and placebo regardless of rescue treatment and treatment discontinuation. The tertiary estimand assesses the average diff erence in response rates, resulting from initiation of a treatment regimen with tralokinumab and additional rescue treatment as compared to a treatment regimen with placebo and additional rescue treatment . Primary analysis for the tertiary estimand Data retrieved at Week 16 for subjects who ha ve permanently discontinued treatment prior to Week 16 will be included in the analysis. Imputation of missing data at Week 16 will be done using multiple imputations with in 6groups defined according to randomised treatm ent arm and whether or not subjects have permanently discontinued IMP prior to Week 16.

Similarly, the available data from not discontinued subjects will be used to impute data for such subjects where the Week 16 value is missing. For not discontinued subjects, the stepwise multiple imputations procedure will be conduct ed in the same way as specified for the primary analysis of the secondary estimand. For discontinued subjects, it is expected that the number of subjects with retrieved data at Week 16 will be too small to facilitate the same imputation model as mentioned above. Consequently, an imputation model with only regi on and baseline effects (IGA as a factor and EASI as a covariate [only for EASI75]) will be applied for discontinued subjects. Some factors may have to be omitted, depending on the observed data, e.g. if retrieved subjects only come from one region or if they all have the same baseline disease severity. The imputed datasets will be analysed in the same way as specified for the primary analysis of the secondary estimand. Sensitivity analyses for the tert iary estimand Rather than imputing Week 16 data as described in the primary analysis of the tertiary estimand, missing observations will be imputed as non -responders. The assumption reflects that discontinued subjects without retrieved data at Week 16 are more likely to be non - responders than resembling discontinued subjects with retrieved data at Week 16. 14.3.5.2 Analysis of secondary efficacy endpoints 14.3.5.2.1 Overview The 3 secondary endpoints evaluate the impact of 16 weeks of treatment on (i) severity and extent of AD, (ii) itch, and (iii) HRQoL. The corresponding endpoints are (i) the change from baseline to Week 16 in SCORAD, (ii) reduction ( yes/no ) of Adolescent Pruritus NRS average score for the past week (hereinafter ‘Adolescent Pruritus NRS weekly average ’) of at least 4 from baseline to Week 16, and (iii) change from baseline to Week 16 in CDLQI score. Subject -reported worst daily itch over the last week prior to baseline will be used to calculate the baseline itch (see also in clusion criterion no. 10).

Sensitivity analyses for the secondary estimand (continuous secondary endpoints) Rather than assuming that observations are missing at ra ndom, it is assumed that missing data from subjects in the tralokinumab arm s who have/have not discontinued treatment prior to Week 16 will resemble data from subjects from the placebo arm who have/have not discontinued treatment prior to Week 16. Imputati on of missing data at Week 16 will be done using a pattern mixture model where missing data in the tralokinumab arm s as well as the placebo arm will be imputed from the placebo arm (copy -reference approach). With this exemption, the multiple imputation procedure and analysis will be conducted in the same way as described for the primary analysis of the secondary estimand f or the continuous secondary endpoints. 14.3.5.2.4 Analysis of additional secondary endpoints To support the primary endpoints, EASI50 at Week 16, at least 90% reduction in EASI score (EASI90 ) at Week 16, and the change from baseline to Week 16 in EASI score will be analysed and presented for the full analysis set.

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. (ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, E6 (R1)). This definition includes: xAccidental injuries. xEvents related to trial procedures. xReasons for any unfavourable and unplanned change in medication (drug and/or dose). xClinically significant worsening of pre -existing conditions. xReasons for admission to hospital or surgical procedures unless these were planned before the subject consented to trial participation . xAEs commonly observed and AEs anticipated based on the pharmacological effect of the IMP. xAny laboratory abnormality asse ssed as clinically significant by the investigator (see Section 11.4.4.2 ). Serious a dverse event definition An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that : xResults in death . xIs life -threatening . xRequires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation. Planned hospitalisation or planned prolonged hospitalisation do not fulfil the criteria for being an SAE but should be d ocumented in the subject ’s medical record.

Events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or ho spitalisation but may jeopardise the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm , blood dyscrasias and c onvulsions that do not result in hospitalisation , development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Mild An AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living. Moderate An AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject. Severe An AE that interrupts u sual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. If the severity of an AE worsens, a new AE should be recorded. Causality The causal relation of the AE to the use of the IMP shou ld be described in terms of probable, possible , or not related according to the investigator ’s clinical judgement. The categories are defined below. Probably relatedFollows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP. Could not be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors or other therapies administered to the subject. Follows a known pattern of response to the IMP. Disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose of the IMP. Reappears or worsens upon re -challenge. TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 138"

Could also be reasonably explained by the subject ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors or other therapies administered to the subject. Follows a known pattern of response to the IMP. Not related Does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the IMP. Is better explained by other factors like the subject ’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors or other therapies administered to the subject. Does not reappear or worsen upon re -challenge. Does not follow a known pattern of response to the IMP. Outcome The outcome of the ev ent according to the investigator ’s clinical judgement should be classified using the categories below. Recovered/ resolvedThe event has stopped. The stop date of the event must be recorded. Recovering/ resolvingThe subject is clearly recovering from an event. The event is not yet completely resolved. Not recovered/not resolvedEvent is still ongoing. Recovered/ resolved with sequelaeThe event has reached a state where no further changes are expected and the residual symptoms are assumed to persist. An example is hemiparesis after stroke. The stop date of the event must be recorded. In case of a SAE, the sequelae should be specified. Fatal The subject has died as a consequence of the event. Date of death is recorded as stop date for the AE. Unknown Unknown to investigator, e.g. subject lost to follow -up. TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 139"
140,page_140,"Trial ID: LP0162-1334 Date: 06-Feb-2020 Version: 7.0 Page 140 of 182 Note that as per the above definition, LEO Pharma uses “RECOVERED/RESOLVED ” only if an event has actually stopped. According to the CDISC definition, the category “RECOVERED/RESOLVED ” also includes events which have improved. However, following the LEO Pharma definitions above, such an improved event will instead be classified as “NOT RECOVERED/NOT RESOLVED ” or “RECOVERING/RESOLVING ”. Similarly, it should be noted that as per the above definition, LEO Pharma uses “RECOVERED/RESOLVED WITH SEQUELAE ” only if an event has reached a state where the residual symptoms are assumed to persist. According to CDISC, an event is considered “WITH SEQUELAE ”, if it has “retained pathological conditions ”. Consequently, it is likely that some of the events classified by LEO Pharma with the outcome “RECOVERED/RESOLVED WITH SEQUELAE ” could have been classified with the outcome “RECOVERED/RESOLVED ” according to the CDISC definition. For SAEs which have stabilised and cannot be expected to recover during trial or safety follow -up periods, for example chronic illnesses, the final outcome should be considered to be ‘not recovered ’. In addition, a statement that the SAE has stabilised or is chronic should be added to the narrative description of the SAE on the SAE form. Please not e that the event should not be reported as ‘recovered ’ on the SAE form. TMF-000042639 - Version 8. 0Anonymized Page 140"

These visits have the following objectives: (i) to continually verify source data to confirm that data entered into the eCRF by authorised site personnel are accurate, complete, a nd verifiable from source documents; (ii) to confirm that the safety and rights of subjects are being protected; and (iii) to confirm that the trialis being conducted in accordance with th e currently approved protocol and any other trial agreements, ICH GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements. The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the trial site ’s recruitment rate and the compliance of the trial site with the protocol and ICH GCP. In order to perform their role effectively, CRAs and persons involved in quality assurance and inspections will need direct access to source data, e.g. medical records, laboratory reports, appointment books, etc. If the electronic medical record does not have a visible audit trail, the investigator must provide the CRA with signed and dated printouts. In addition, relevant site staff should be available for discussions at monit oring visits and between monitoring visits (e.g. by telephone). Protocol compliance Protocol deviations will be documented and notified to the investigator . Protocol deviations will be assessed by LEO Pharma and critical protocol deviations will be described in the CTR. Sponsor audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory agency inspections The clinical trial will be subject to audits conducted by LEO Pharma or inspections from domestic or foreign regulatory authori ties or from IRBs/IECs. Audits and inspections may take place during or after the trial. The investigator and the site staff as well as LEO Pharma staff have an obligation to cooperate and assist in audits and inspections. This includes giving auditors and inspectors direct access to all source doc uments and other documents at the trial site relevant to the clinical trial.

The investigator or staff authorised by the investigator will enter subject data into eCRFs. Data recorded in the eCRFs will be accessible to the trial site and LEO Pharma personnel immediately after entry. The eCRFs must be maintained in an up -to-date state by the trial site at all times. The investigator must verify the correctness of the data entere d by the site by electronically dating and signing all eCRFs used. This signature information will be kept in the audit trail and cannot be altered. Any correction(s) made by the investigator or authorised site staff to the eCRF after original entry will be documented in the audit trail. Changes to data already approved will require the re -signature by the investigator. The person making the change to the data, and the date, time and reason for the change will be identified in the audit trail. Subject data should be entered into the eCRF no later than 5 working days after each visit , unless a different deadline is stated in the Clinical Trial Agreement. Queries for discrepant data will be generated automatically by the system upon entry or manually by the CRA, sponsor ’s medical expert, or the data manager. All queries will be raised electronically within the electronic data capture system. This systematic validation will ensure that a clean and consistent database is provided for the statistical analysis. An ePRO solution will be used to capture patient -reported data ( data from questionnaires completed at the trial site and eDiary data ).

Appendix 3 H: Committee structure Patient safety will be carefully assessed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). All members will be independent of the trial (that is, they will not be participating investigators or employees at participating sites) and of LEO Pharma (that is, they will not be LEO Pharma employees). The DMC members are experienced with clinical trials and will be responsible for assessing the safety of the subjects through assessment of the safety of the treatment regimen during the trial and through monitoring the overall conduct of the trial. The DMC will review unblinded data on a regular basis. Additional meetings may also be called on at an ad hoc basis, as requested by the DMC or LEO. All data collected at the time of the data cut -off/scheduled meetings will be included in the summaries for the DMC, including data from subjects still ongoing in the trial. The DMC will examine summaries and listings of AEs, specific laboratory parameters and subject disposition data as detailed in the DMC charter. Full details of the analyses to be presented to the DMC will be specified in a separate DMC statistical analysis plan. The DMC will have an independent statistician and an independent administrator who will remain independent of the trial management team. The chairman of the DMC, in conjunction with the other m embers, will communicate their recommendations to LEO Pharma ’s clinical project manager after each meeting. The chairman of the DMC will provide written reports to LEO Pharma after each formal review to indicate the committee ’s recommendation regarding saf ety concerns and trial continuation.

If a clinical trial is suspended or prematurely ter minated, the investigator must inform the subjects promptly and ensure appropriate therapy and follow -up. As specified by applicable regulatory requirements, the investigator or LEO Pharma must promptly inform IRB/IECs and provide a detailed written explan ation. Relevant competent authorities must be informed. The trial must be terminated if the percepti on of the benefit/risk ratio (judged from clinical signs and symptoms, (S)AEs and/or remarkable safety laboratory changes) becomes unfavourable for the cont inuation of the trial. Reasons for the early closure of a trial site by LEO Pharma or investigator may include but are not limited to: xFailure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/IEC or local health authorities, LEO Pharma ’s procedures, or GCP guidelines. xInadequate recruitment of subjects by the investigator. Completion of trial Investigators will be informed when subject recruitment is to cease. Screening activities will be stopped at a trial site when the total requested number of subjects for the clinical trial has been obtained, irrespective of the specific site ’s planned inclusion number. Trial sites will be closed upon trial completion. LEO Pharma will undertake arrangements for the collection and disposal of any unused trial material that the investigator is not required to keep in his/her files. A trial site is considered closed when all required documents and trial supplies have been collected and a tria l site closure visit has been performed. When the trial has been completed, the investigators will receive information about the treatment allocation for the subjects randomised at their respective sites and will be asked to record this in the subject ’s medical record.

Overall rationale for the amendment The protocol was updated in response to guidance received from the European Health Authorities during their review of the protocol. The table below presents the changes in each section marked as tracked changes (text added to the protocol is written in bold and deleted text has a line through it ) Section no. and nameDescription of change Brief rationale Section 4 Schedule of trial procedures (Panel 2 & Panel 4) Section 9.2 Administration of IMP Section 11.4.1 Vital signsExtension of the post dosing observation period: For the first 3 IMP dosing visits in the initial treatment period (i.e., Weeks 0, 2, and 4) and in open -label treatment, subjects will be monitored after IMP administration for immediate drug reactions for a minimum of 2 hours 30 minutes with vital signs taken at every 30 minutes or until stable, whichever is later.The currently available safety data including tralokinumab exposure in 78 adolescent subjects with asthma were not deemed sufficient to justify a shortening of the post dosing observation period following the first 3 IMP administrations. Hence, this period has been extended to 2 hours as this is aligned with the post dosing period in used in previous tralokinumab trials in adults with asthma and at opic dermatitis.

Overall rati onale for the amendment The main reasons for the amendment are to clarify the sections of the protocol describing skin swabs, and transepidermal water loss ase ssments, to update the requirements for IMP destruction at sites, and to introduce a country -specific requirement that will allow the order of trial procedures to be changed after the randomisation visit at sites in Japan to align with standard clinical procedures in Japan. It has been clarified that skin swabs and transepidermal water loss assessment s will be performed both on lesional and non -lesional skin. The LEO trial product handling guideline has been updated and no longer requires sites to be able to issue certificates of IMP destruction at sites, this requirement has been deleted from the protocol. The standard clinical procedure in Japan is to perform safety and laboratory assessments before meeting the principal investigator, a permission for such a change to the order of assessments after the baseline visit has been added as a country -specif ic requirement for Japan. The assessments must be performed in the same order for all subjects at the site. In addition, the amendment includes other changes, as presented in the table below.

Section 14.3.4 Multiple testing strategy A US multiple testing procedure has been introduced in addition to the global (non-US) tes ting procedure. The text has been updated to highlight the difference between the 2 testing procedures. As the FDA has requested a multiple testing strategy in which the secondary endpoint Pruritus is tested independently of the secondary endpoints SCORAD and CDLQI. Appendix 8 Country-specific requirements: Japan In Japan, SAE reporting will continue to be done using paper SAE forms. The country-specific requirements for Japan have been updated with exceptions to the electronic SAE reporting described in Section 13.4 and follow-up for final outcome of adverse events described in Section 13.7. As electronic SAE reporting requires investigators to frequently access the eCRF, which is not standard practice in Japan. In Japan, data entry in the eCRF is outsourced to site management organisations, and therefore paper forms are the preferred way of reporting SAEs in Japan.
