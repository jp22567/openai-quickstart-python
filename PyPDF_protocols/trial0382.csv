INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION Worldwide PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT 3 STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary objective:  The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in children 6 to <12 years of age with uncontrolled persistent asthma Secondary objectives:  To assess the safety and tolerability of dupilumab  To evaluate the effect of dupilumab in improving patient reported outcomes (PROs) including health related quality of life (HRQoL)  To assess the dupilumab systemic exposure and incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA).  To evaluate the association between dupilumab treatment and pediatric immune responses to vaccines: any vaccination for tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis and/or seasonal trivalent/quadr ivalent influenza vaccine Exploratory objectives:  To explore baseline and on -treatment levels of biomarkers for their potential to predict and to associate with a treatment response  To evaluate the proportion of patients requiring increased dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) or step up in the second controller medication regimen.  To evaluate the effect of dupilumab on additional PROs STUDY DESIGN Gener al Design Multinational, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study assessing the effect of dupilumab administered subcutaneously (SC) for a maximum of 52 weeks in children 6 to <12 years of age with uncontrolled asthma . Periods The clinical trial consists of three periods:  Screening Period (4 [±1] weeks) to determine a patient’s eligibility status and establish level of asthma control before randomization  Treatment Period 52 weeks to treat with dupilumab or placebo SC injection  Post -treatment Period 12 weeks to monitor a patient’s status when off study drug treatment for patients who choose not to participate in the 1 -year long -term extension study VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"
8,page_8,"Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 03 18-Oct-2019 EFC14153 - dupilumab Version number: 1 Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 9 Screening Period Prior to and during the Screening Period, patients must be on one of the following: stable -dose background therapy of medium -dose ICS with second controller medication (ie, long-acting β2 agonist [LABA], leukotriene receptor antagonist [LTRA], long -acting musca rinic antagonist [LAMA], or methylxanthines) or high -dose ICS alone or high -dose ICS with second controller, for at least 3 months with a stable dose ≥1 month prior to Screening Visit 1. The Screening Period will be of 4 (±1) weeks in duration. Randomized Treatment Period Patients are randomized to either dupilumab or matching placebo administered SC for a maximum treatment duration of 52 weeks. During the Randomized Treatment Period, patients continue the stable dose(s) of controller medication used duri ng the Screening Period. For patients experiencing a deterioration of asthma during the study, the ICS dose may temporarily be increased up to 4 -fold (recorded as a loss of asthma control [LOAC] event) for a maximum of 10 days, as indicated and upon recomm endation of the physician and/or Investigator. Treatment may then be changed to systemic corticosteroids (severe exacerbation event) or revert back to the original ICS dose depending on asthma symptom progression. Patients may be placed on systemic cortic osteroids at any time as clinically indicated based on the presence of symptoms consistent with a severe asthma exacerbation event, as per the Investigator’s judgment. If a patient experiences 2 or more severe asthma exacerbation events anytime during the study, a permanent change (ie, step up in medium - to high-dose ICS or addition of second controller for patients on high -dose ICS monotherapy) on their stable -dose background controller medication may occur, as indicated and upon recommendation of the phys ician and/or Investigator. Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to return to the clinic for study visits and participate in assessments according to the visit schedule until the end of the study (EOS) with a ±5 day window or up to recovery or stabilization of any adverse event (AE). At the time of permanent treatment discontinuation, patients will perform the early treatment discontinuation (ETD) visit with all the assessments defined for the end -of-treatmen t (EOT) Visit 28. Patients who permanently discontinue early from treatment will not be eligible for the 1 -year long -term extension study. For patients who permanently discontinue the study, under exceptional circumstances where there is no possibility for a patient and parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) to come to the site for the scheduled follow -up visit, a phone contact may be made after Sponsor’s approval is given. During that phone contact, at least information about AEs, concomitant medication and asthma exacerbation events must be collected , and the schedule for these calls should still reflect the visit schedule . Patients who discontinue early from treatment may be asked to return to the clinic to have additional ADA samples collected for ana lysis based on the overall assessment of antibody titers and clinical presentation at the time of discontinuation.

The assumed relative risk reductions are based on the results in the phase 3 asthma EFC13579 QUEST study . To achieve target sample size for each of the population s stated above, approximately 402 patients in the overall population (268 for dupil umab and 134 for placebo) need to be randomized assuming approximately 86% of the randomized patients with type 2 inflammat ory phenotype (baseline blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/μL or baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb ), assuming approximately 81% of the randomized patients have baseline blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/μL, and approximately 64% of the randomized patients have baseline blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/μL . Patients will be randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive dupilumab or matching placebo. After a patient is ran domly assigned to dupilumab or matching placebo, the dosage of dupilumab or matching placebo for the patient, 200 or 100 mg SC once q2w, will be determined based on body weight >30 kg or ≤30 kg, respectively. Randomization will be stratified by ICS dose (medium -dose versus high -dose) and eosinophil count (<300 cells/μL versus ≥300 cells/μL) at Screening, and by region. Analysis populations: In order to confirm the efficacy of dupilumab with appropriate multiplicity control, there will be two primary anal ysis populations to evaluate the efficacy endpoints: 1) Population with t ype 2 inflammat ory phenotype will be defined as randomized patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/μL or baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb ( 1). This multiplicity control will be applied to the analysis in countries that use the same or similar indication as approved in the EU. 2) Population with b aseline blood eosinophil ≥300 c ells/µL, which is defined as the randomized patients with baseline blood eosinophil ≥300 cells/µL, will be the primary analysis population that the VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

In addition, patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/µL will be tested in the hierarchy. This multiplicity will be used in countries with the same or similar indication wordings as approved in the US . The efficacy analyses will be conducted according to the treatment to which they are randomized. The analysis population for the safety endpoints will be the safety population, defined as all patients exposed to study medication, regardless of the amount of treatment administer ed and regardless of whether they are randomized. The safety analyses will be conducted according to the treatment patients actually received. Analysis of the primary endpoint The estimand of the dupilumab treatment effect compares the annualized rate of severe exacerbation for the patients randomized to the dupilumab and placebo arms, regardless of what treatment patients actually received. It assesses the benefits of the treatment policy or strategy relative to placebo. In this primary approach, off -treatment measurements of patients who prematurely discontinue treatment will be included for the analysis. Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits. If a pati ent stays in study till the end of 52 -week treatment period, all severe exacerbation events that happen up to Week 52 will be included in the primary analysis, regardless if the patient is on -treatment or not. If a patient withdraws from study prior to the end of 52 -week treatment period, all observed severe exacerbation events up to the last contact date will be included in the analysis, and the observation duration is defined as from randomization to the last contact date. No imputation will be performed for the unobserved events that may happen after study discontinuation and up to Week 52. The annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbation events will be analyzed using a negative binomial regression model. The analysis of the primary endpoint will be con ducted in the type 2 inflammatory phenotype, baseline blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/μL, baseline blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/μL, baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb and full intent -to-treat (ITT ) populations using approp riate multiplicity control. When performing the primary endpoint analysis in the type 2 inflammatory phenotype, baseline blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/μL or the full ITT populations, t he model will include the total number of events of each patient occurrin g during the 52 weeks as the response variable, with the treatment group, age, weight (≤30kg, >30kg), region, baseline eosinophil level (<300 cells/μL, ≥300 cells/μL ), baseline FeNO level (<20 ppb, ≥20 ppb ), baseline ICS dose level (medium/high) and number of severe asthma exacerbation events prior to the study as covariates. When performing the primary endpoint analysis in the baseline blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/μL population, the baseline eosinophil level will be removed from the model covariates. When performing the primary endpoint analysis in the baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb population, the baseline FeNO level will be removed from the model covariates. Severe asthma exacerbation event prior to the study is defined as treatment with a systemic steroid (oral or parenteral) for worsening asthma at least once or hospitalization or emergency medical care visit for worsening asthma (as defined in this protocol). Log transformed observation duration will be the offset variable. VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

The supportive analysis will be performed in the type 2 inflammatory phenotype and baseli ne blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/μL populations and will use a negative binomial model with the same set of covariates as specified for the primary analysis in the two populations . This model will include severe exacerbation events occurring during the trea tment epoch before any permanent stepping -up of background asthma medication as the response variable and the log transformed duration of the treatment or from randomization to first permanent stepping -up of background asthma medication whichever is shorte r will be the offset variable. The analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted in the type 2 inflammatory phenotype, baseline blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/μL, baseline blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/μL, baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb , and full ITT populations using appropriate multiplicity control . Multiplicity considerations The hypothesis testing on the primary endpoint of annualized severe exacerbation rate will be controlled with a two -sided type I error of 0.05 by incorporating a sequential testing proced ure as below: For US and US reference countries : 1st: Annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during the 52 -week placebo -controlled treatment period based on the patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/µL . 2nd: Annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during the 52 -week placebo -controlled treatment period based on the patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/µL . 3rd: Annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during the 52 -week placebo -contro lled treatment period based on the patients with type 2 inflammat ory phenotype (baseline blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/µL or baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb ). For EU and EU reference countries : 1st: Annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during the 52 -week placebo -controlled treatment period based on the patients with type 2 inflamma tory phenotype (baseline blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/µL or baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb). 2nd: Annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during the 52 -week placebo -controlled treatment period based on the patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/µL population . 3rd: Annualized rate of severe exacerbation events during the 52 -week placebo -controlled treatment period based on the patients with baseline blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/µL population . Multiplicity control for any secondary endpoints if considered will be specified in the SAP. Otherwise, nominal p -values will be provided. Handling of missing data If patients withdraw from the study before Week 52 with severe exacerbation events that may occur after study discontinuation, these patients are considered as patients with missing data on severe exacerbation.

In the primary analysis, all observed data will be used regardless of treatment adherence or increase of asthma background medication. No imputation will be conducted for the missing severe e xacerbation information after a patient prematurely withdraws from the study up to Week 52. In addition, sensitivity analyses based on pattern mixture model, placebo based pattern mixture model and tipping point analysis based on the same negative binomial model as being used in the primary analysis may be conducted to assess the robustness of the conclusion of the main model. Details of these sensitivity analyses will be described in the SAP. Analysis of other secondary endpoints The change from baseline for continuous endpoints will be analyzed using a mixed -effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) approach. The model will include change from baseline as response variables, and for treatment, age, weight (≤30kg, >30kg), region, baseline eosinophil level (<300 cells/μL, ≥300 cells/μL ), baseline FeNO level (<20 ppb, ≥20 ppb ), baseline ICS dose level (medium/high), visit, treatment -by-visit interaction, baseline value, and baseline -by-visit interaction as covariates ; unless otherwis e specified (details will be documented in SAP) . Sex, height, and ethnicity will also be included as covariates in the models for spirometry parameters. An unstructured correlation matrix will be used to model the within -patient errors. Parameters will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood method using the Newton -Raphson algorithm. Statistical inferences on treatment comparisons for the change from baseline at Weeks 12 will be derived from the mixed - effect model with Kenward and Roger degree of f reedom adjustment approach. Treatment comparisons at other timepoints, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 52 Week and other timepoints in between will also be provided from the mixed - effect model for descriptive purpose. Data up to Week 52 will be included as response vari ables. Time to first severe asthma exacerbation event and time to first LOAC will be analyzed using a Cox regression model with time -to-event as the dependent variable, and treatment, age, weight (≤30kg, >30kg), region, baseline eosinophil level (<300 cell s/μL, ≥300 cells/μL ), baseline FeNO level (<20 ppb, ≥20 ppb ), baseline ICS dose level (medium/high) and number of asthma events prior to the study as covariates. The estimated hazard ratio (dupilumab versus placebo) along with its 95% confidence interval will be presented. T he Kaplan -Meier method will be used to derive the proportion of patients with a severe asthma exacerbation event at Weeks 12, 24, 36, and 52, specific to each treatment group. The safety variables, including AEs, laboratory parameters, vital signs, ECG, and physical examinations will be summarized using descriptive statistics . The analysis of safety variables will be performed based on the safety population. Interim Analysis There is no interim analysis planned for this study . Planned da tabase lock The database lock is planned based on the time when all randomized patients reach complete week 52 visit or discontinue from the study before week 52. Analyses will be based on all data collected up to this database lock and will be considered as the final analyses in the CSR (Clinical Study Report). Additional data between database lock and last patient completing last visit will be summarized in a CSR addendum . VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

Prior to and during the Scre ening Period, patients must be on one of the following: stable -dose background therapy of medium -dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with second controller medication (ie, long -acting β 2 agonist [LABA], leukotriene receptor antagonist [LTRA], long -acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), or methylxanth ines) or high -dose ICS alone or high -dose ICS with second controller, for at least 3 months with a stable dose ≥1 month prior to Screening Visit 1. b Randomization Visit (Visit 2) is defined as Day 1. The randomization will be stratified by eosinophil count (<300 cells/ µL and ≥300 cells/µL) and stable dose -level of ICS (medium/high) at Screening, and by region. c Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to return to the clinic for study visi ts and participate in as sessments according to the visit schedule until the end of the study (EOS) with a ±5 day window or up to recovery or stabilization of any adverse event. At the time of permanent treatment discontinuation, patients will perform the early treatment discontin uation (ETD) visit with all the assessments defined for the end -of-treatment (EOT) Visit 28. However, patients who discontinue early from treatment will not be eligible for the 1 -year long -term extension study. For patients who permanently discontinue the study, under exceptional circumstances where there is no possibility for a patient and parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian( s) to come to the site for the scheduled follow -up visit, a phone contact may be made after Sponsor’s approval is given. During th at phone contact, at least information about adverse events (AEs), concomitant medication and asthma exacerbation events must be collected, and the schedule for these calls should still reflect the visit schedule. Patients who discontinue early from treat ment may be asked to return to the clinic to have additional ADA samples collected for analysis based on the overall assessme nt of antibody titers and clinical presentation at the time of discontinuation. d Eligible patients who complet e the Randomized Treat ment Period will be offered the opportunity to participate in the 1 -year long -term extension study with dupilumab. Patients subsequently enrolled in the 1 -year long-term extension study will not participate in the post -treatment period of this trial. e The v isit windows for all subsequent visits post -randomization on Day 1 will be ±3 days during the treatment period and ±5 days during the post -treatment period.

For girls who have started menstruating, a specific assent form must be obtained. . g Medical history, asthma -specific medical history (ie, family history of atopy & Ig E mediated disease [particularly maternal], premature birth and/or , low birthweight, exposure to tobacco smoke, recurring viral infections in early childhood), surgical history. h Reversibility of at least 10% in FEV1 after the administration of 200 to 400 mcg (2 to 4 puff inhalations with metered -dose inhaler [MDI]) of albuterol/salbutamol or 45 to 90 mcg (2 to 4 puffs with MDI) of levalbuterol/levosalbutamol reliever medication before randomization (up to 3 opportunities during the same visit are allowed with a maximum of 12 puffs of reliever medicati on if tolerated by the patient). Documented reversibility or positive airway hyp er-responsiveness to methacholine within 12 months prior to Screening V1 is considered acceptable. If the subject does not meet this reversibility criterion at Screening V1, up to 2 additional assessment attempts can be performed at any time between Screen ing and Baseline Visit 2. i A separate assent must be obtained from female patients at the earliest visit when the investigator is notified that the firs t menses have occurred. j Vital signs, including blood pressure (mmHg), heart rate (beats per minute), resp iratory rate (breaths per minute), body temperature (degrees Celsius), height (cm) and body weight (kg) will be measured at t he Screening and Randomization visits (Visits 1 and 2) and every subsequent visit. Vital signs will be measured in the sitting p osition using the same arm at each visit, and will be measured prior to receiving investigational product at the clinic visits. k Electronic diary/PEF meter is used for daily recording of salbutamol/albuterol or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol use, asthma con troller drug use, oral steroid requirements, nocturnal awakenings due to asthma symptoms requiring the use of reliever medications, morning and evening asthma symptom NRS scores and AM and PM PEF. This dev ice is dispensed at Visit 1 and information is downloade d from this device on the other indicated days. l During the Randomized Treatment Period IMP administrations, every 2 week (q2w), will be performed by the Investigator at sche duled study site visits (must be separated by at least 11 days) up to Week 50. In the first 12 weeks (up to V8), patients will be monitored at the study site for a minimum of 30 minutes after injection of IMP , to assess any injection reactions (see Section 8.1.4 for more details). After randomization, dose regimen will not be adjusted for patient’s age or weight until the randomized treatment will be completed. m Home Dosing and training of parent(s)/c aregiver(s)/legal guardian(s): For all visits scheduled only for IMP administration (ie, at Weeks 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, and 50), parent(s)/car egiver(s)/legal guardian(s) may decide to do the injection of IMP at home (ie, home administration o f IMP). These parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) will be trained by the Investigator or designee to administer IMP, by demonstration at V2, V3, and V4 (injections performed by Investigator). After parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) have s uccess fully administered IMP under close supervision of the Investigator at V5 -V8 (Weeks 6, 8, 10, and 12), the Investigator may approve them to perform home administration of IMP at all further visits that do not require a scheduled visit. It is possible to sta rt home administration at any visit following V9, provided parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) have been trained by the investigator or designee to administ er IMP by demonstration at not less than 3 visits followed by a successful IMP administration u nder close supervision of the investigator or designee at not less than 3 visits. However, if parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) do not develop the comfort to inject the IMP at home, or the Investigato r determines that injection by parent(s)/caregiv er(s)/legal guardian(s) at home is not appropriate, alternative arrangements may be made: for example for qualified site personnel and/or healthcare professionals ( eg, visiting nurse service) to administer IMP at these timepoints at the patient's home. n Forced expiratory volume (FEV1), PEF, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow between 25% to 75% of vital capacity ( FEF25% -75%) at all visits; pulmonary function tests should be performed in the morning if possible, but if it could only be done at a different time of the day, the spirometry should be done at approximately the same time of the day at each visit throughout the study. Spirometry will be performed after a wash out period of bronchodilators according to their action duration, for exampl e, withholding the last dose of salbutamol/albuterol or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol for at least 6 hours, withholding the last dose of LABA for at least 12 hours, and withholding the last dose of LAMA for at least 24 hours. This will be verifi ed before per forming the PEF measurements. o Treatment Period stability limits will be established for FEV1 and PEF. Period stability limit for PEF is defined as the resp ective mean AM or PM PEF obtained over the last 7 days prior to Visit 2 (Day1). There should be at le ast 4 days’ measurement for setting up the stability limit, and the first dosing visit should be rescheduled until data for 4 days are available. p Asthma Control Questionnaire –Interviewer Administered (ACQ -IA, for children 6 to <12 years), ACQ -7 and ACQ -5 scores and Paediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire With Standardised Activities – Interviewer Administered (PAQLQ(S) -IA) score, for children ≥7 years old at Randomization V2 , are administered by the interviewer during the study visits at the clinical site. The ACQ -7 score will be used to follow up evaluations in all patients. The ACQ -5 (the first 5 items of the ACQ -7) score is used for eligibility evaluation at Screening V1 and Baseline V2 for all patients. q Pediatric rhinoconjunctivitis quality of l ife questionnaire –Interviewer Administered (PRQLQ -IA): For those patients with comorbid allergic rhinitis, administered by the interviewer during the study visits at the clini cal site. r Biomarker set includes serum Thymus and Activation -Regulated Chemokine (TARC).

The inflammatory component of asthma involves many cell types, including mast cells, eosinophils, T -lymphocytes, neutrophils, and epitheli al cells and their biological products. For most asthma patients, a regimen of controller therapy and reliever therapy provides adequate long-term control. The majority of children with asthma have mild or moderate disease and can obtain adequate asthma c ontrol through avoidance of triggering factors and/or with the help of medications, such as short -acting inhaled β2 -receptor agonists, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and, when needed, addition of lo ng-acting β2 -receptor agonists and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA ). However, 2 -5% of all asthmatic children have uncontrolled asthma despite maximum treatment with conventional medic ations ( 2). Children with such severe symptoms are heterogeneous with respect to trigger factors, pulmonary function, inflammatory pattern an d clinical symptoms ( 3). These children have a reduced quality of life, account for a large proportion of the healthcare costs related to asth ma and represent a continuous clinical challenge to the pediatrician. Additionally, the long term adverse effects of systemic and ICS on bone metabolism, adrenal function, and growth in children lead to attempts to minimize the amount of corticosteroid usa ge. Lastly, the consequences of unresponsiveness to therapy or lack of compliance with therapy are evidenced by loss of asthma control (LOAC ), which can be severe (ie, severe asthma exacerbation event ) and possibly life -threatening. The poor response of some patients with asthma may reflect the number of cellular and molecular mechanisms operative in asthma. There is increasing interest in distinct phenotypes because targeted therapy is more likely to be successful in patients with similar underlying pathobiologic features ( 4). Recent therapeutic approaches in asthma have been focused on tr ying to control type 2 inflammation. A vast majority of 6 -11 years old with asthma show evidence of type 2 inflammation characterized by upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, interleukin -4 (IL -4), interleukin -5 (IL-5), and interleukin -13 (IL -13). The most recent GINA guidelines (1) for management of severe asthma report that for patients with severe asthma, type 2 inflammation can be identified by elevated peripheral eosinophils ( ≥150 cells/µL ) and/or elevated FeNO ( ≥20 ppb), and/or sputum eosinophils ≥2%, and/or asthma that is clinically allergen -driven. Up-regulation of IL -4 and IL -13 activity has been implicated as an important inflammatory component of asthma disease progression. Dupilumab is under development as a potential novel treatment for asth ma. Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, is directed against the IL -4 receptor alpha subunit (IL -4Rα), which is a component of IL -4 heterodimeric receptors Type I (IL4-ligand only) and Type II (both IL -4 and IL -13 ligands). The binding of dupiluma b to IL -4Rα results in blockade of downstream signaling initiated by both IL -4 and IL -13. For complete information regarding the preclinical and clinical evaluation of dupilumab to date, see the Investigator’s Brochure. 4.1 RATIONALE This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled efficacy and safety study to be conducted in children 6 to <12 years of age with uncontrolled persistent asthma w hile on a VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

This study is designed to investigate the efficacy and safety profile of dupilumab over one year in a population of asthma tic children in need for an additional treatment to their current maintenance management. The presence of a placebo arm is appropriate for the objectives of this study since it will provide the most robust assessment of the efficacy and safety of dupilumab . The proposed study design provides the opportunity to understand better the efficacy of dupilumab on multiple asthma domains including prevention of severe exacerbations, lung function and symptom control. The short and long term effects on lung function a nd symptom control will be evaluated. 4.2 RATIONALE FOR DOSE S ELECTION The dose regimens for pediatric patients aged 6 to <12 years are selected based on the observed efficacy and s afety in the dose ranging study in adult asthma patients (Phase 2b study DRI12544), the PK characterization and safety observation in pediatric atopic dermatitis (AD ) study (R668 -AD-1412) of 6 to <18 years, as well as the available blinded safety data of EFC13579, the asthma pivotal study being conducted in adults and adolescents. In the completed Phase 2b dose ranging study (DRI12544), dupilumab efficacy at 4 dose regimens (300 mg once every 4 weeks (q4w ) and once every 2 weeks (q2w ), and 200 mg q2w and q4w with a total dose on Day 1 of 600 mg for (the 300 mg regimen) and 400 mg (for the 200 mg regimen) respectively, was evaluated in patients with uncontrolled asthma while receiving a stable dose of medium to high -dose ICS/ Long -acting β2 agonist (LABA ) in addition to their study treatment (placebo or dupilumab). Dupilumab demonstrated dose dependent improvement, compared with placebo, in the change from baseline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 ) at Week 12. In additio n, consistent efficacy results in favor of dupilumab over placebo were observed in the majority of main secondary efficacy endpoints including annualized rate of severe exacerbation events. The maximum treatment effects were observed in the 200 mg and 300 mg q2w regimens. Exposure -response analyses further supported the maximal effect for both endpoints of FEV1 and severe exacerbation rate approached/achieved at the steady -state exposure of the two q2w regimens (mean steady -state trough concentrations of 28 .3 and 58.5 mg/L, respectively). Dupilumab was observed to be safe and well tolerated across all dose regimens examined. Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs ) were reported in 79.1% p atients in the dupilumab groups (75.3% to 82.8%) and 74.7% patients in the placebo group. The most frequently reported TEAEs included injection site reactions, respiratory tract infections and related symptoms, headache, and back pain. There was no apparen t dose relationship for any particular TEAE except for injection site reactions, majority of which were mild in nature. From the available blinded safety data of EFC13579, injection site erythema, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infection wer e the 3 most commonly reported TEAEs among adolescents in this study. None of the TEAEs observed in the 26 adolescents dosed at the time of blinded analysis were severe or serious. No new safety signal was identified in these adolescent patients compared t o adults. The top 3 most common TEAEs in adolescents were also the most common reported TEAEs in adults in this study and the DRI12544 study. VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

The 2 assessed dose regimens at 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg corresponds to the weight normalized dose in adults at 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively. Dupilumab administered as single and repeated weekly doses of 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg for 4 weeks was generally safe and well tolerated in both pediatric age groups included in that study. There was a higher incidence of TEAEs following s ingle and repeated weekly administration of 4 mg/kg compared to 2 mg/kg in both age -groups. However, most of the adverse events (AE ) were mild in intensity, transient in nature and not related to study drug. There were no new safety signals detected with dupilumab in the pediatric age 6 to <18 years. The most common AEs reported after both single doses and repeated weekly doses were nasopharyngitis and exacerbation of AD. In study R668 -AD-1412, dupilumab admi nistered as a single dose of either 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg, in the Study R668 -AD-1412, induced significant and rapid reduction of disease activity in patients at Week 2 (34% and 51% reduction in eczema area and severity index (EASI ) score from baseline for 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg doses respectively. Repeated weekly doses of dupilumab led to a further improvement in disease severity in patients in both dose groups (67% and 70% reduction in EASI score fr om baseline for 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg doses, respectively, at Week 12). There did not appear to be a clear dose response, as the 2 dose groups showed similar efficacy on the various endpoints evaluated during the study. The collective clinical data on the e xposure versus efficacy and safety in the adults and pediatric population as observed to date supports a similar exposure -response relationship for efficacy and safety between the adult and pediatric populations down to 6 years of age and justify the appro ach of selecting EFC14153 dose regimen based on the criteria of matching adult efficacious and safe exposure. Dupilumab PK is not affected by disease status/population in adults. Similar PK profile was observed between healthy subjects, and patients with A D or asthma. Thus, the same PK profile is anticipated in children with asthma and AD which supports the use of AD -1412 PK data for the pediatric asthma dose selection. The observed pediatric PK profile analysis showed general similarity in dupilumab PK pro file between adults and children after accounting for body size difference. Similar to adults, body weight (bw ) was the only statistically significant covariate of dupilumab PK identified in the pediatric populati on of 6 to 17 years, where clearance and volume of distribution decreases with decreasing bw following an allometric relationship. There was no significant impact of age and gender on dupilumab PK after adjustment of the bw effect. A pediatric Pop PK model was developed using pediatric data alone (AD -1412) together with single IV dose PK data in healthy volunteers (AS -0907) to further evaluate the typical pharmacokinetics in the pediatric population, and to identify and quantify PK variability component in the pediatric population. The pediatric Pop PK model shares the same two - compartment model structure as that of adults with the first -order absorption, and parallel linear and nonlinear elimination (target -mediated disposition with quasi steady -state QSS approximation).

39,page_39,"Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 03 18-Oct-2019 EFC14153 - dupilumab Version number: 1 Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 40 To determine the appropriate dose regimen, the population PK simulation was conducted using the pediatric Pop PK model and the pediatric demographic data of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (CDC -NHANES ) database. The NHANES population of 6 to 11 years is adequate to reflect the inter -subject variability to inform the dosage recommendation in the age group. To account for body size difference in the pediatric population and taking into account the observed large therapeutic indices of dupilumab, a tiered fixed dosing regimen was chosen over weight based (mg /kg) dosing, as this approach offers a potential safety advantage of reducing the risk of dosing errors, as well as dosing convenience for patients by allowing self -administration using a prefilled syringe/device. The dosing regimen was selected as shown b elow: Dupilumab 200 or 100 mg SC once q2w for children with bw >30 kg or ≤30 kg, respectively. The predicted exposure at 200 mg q2w in children aged 6 to <12 years weighing more than 30 kg largely overlaps with the observed efficacious exposure in adults at 300 mg and 200 mg q2w and is expected to be well within the adult safe exposure of up to 300 mg qw. Similarly, the lower dose of 100 mg q2w in children less than 30 kg is predicted to provide comparable exposure to that in the heavier children and the a dults. Moreover, the estimated range of steady -state C max was generally within the range of pediatric exposure in 6 to <12 years observed in AD -1412 which was well tolerated and safe. In summary, the proposed tiered dosing regimen (200 mg q2w weighing >30 kg and 100 mg q2w weighing ≤30 kg) for children aged 6 to <12 years is expected to provide significant clinical benefit and a safety profile similar to that of older patients.

Additional information will be provided in the Pharmacy manual. 8.1.4 Dosing schedule The IMP is administered every 14±3 days q2w. The doses of investigational product must be separated by ≥11 days to avoid overdose. The IMP administrations will be performed by the Investigator or designee at scheduled study site visits following clinic procedures and blood collection (see Section 1.2). Patients will be monitored for a minimum of 30 minutes after each study -site administrated injection of IMP, to assess any injection site reactions (eg, for any signs or symptoms of a hype rsensitivity reaction). For all visits scheduled only for IMP administration, parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) may decide to do the injection of IMP at home (ie, home administration of IMP).

For IMP doses no t given at the study site, ‘home dosing diary’ (paper format) will be provided to record information related to the injections. Such ho me dosing diaries will be kept as source data in the patient’s study file. Parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) should be instructed to avoid missing any site visits (ie, IMP doses) or doses of background therapy during the study. For any patient who misses a site-visit (ie, IMP dose) or doses of background therapy, the parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) should be reminded to be diligent to avoid missed visits and doses of background therapy thereafter. The patient(s)/parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) should continue their scheduled visits for IMP treatment (with study procedures, as detailed in Section 1.2), even if more than 2 consecutive doses of IMP are missed, or background medication was not taken by the patient(s) for up to 2-4 days. The SC injection sites should be alternated among the 4 quadrants of th e abdomen (avoiding navel and waist areas), the upper thighs or the upper arms, so that the same site is not injected twice consecutively.

Please refer to medium and high -dose of ICS in Appendix A . If the Investigator, based on his/her medical judgment, decides to optimize a patients use of asthma re liever and/or background controller medications prior to the Screening Visit, any changes in ongoing asthma medications must occur more than 1 month in advance of the Screening Visit Day 1, in order to maintain a stable dose for at least 1 month prior to D ay 1 (Section 7.1). The introduction of new controller medications must occur at least 3 months prior to Screening with a stable dose for at least 1 month ( Section 7.1). Randomized Treatment Perio d During this period, patients will continue to take their controller medication(s) used during the Screening Period. The dose of baseline regimen should not be changed, and no adjustments will be made unless the patient experiences 2 or more severe exacerba tions events at any time during the study (in which case a step up of controller medication may be allowed). This will be recorded in the eDiary . Patients may be placed on systemic corticosteroids at any time as clinically indicated based on the presence o f symptoms consistent with a severe asthma exacerbation event, as per the Investigator’s judgment. Post-treatment Period Upon completing the randomized treatment period, patients not continuing with the long -term, open -label extension study will enter the Post Treatment Period and will proceed to be treated VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

All other reliever medications other than albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol should be avoided . Patient(s)/parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) may administer albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol reliever medication by MDI as needed durin g the study . Nebulizer solutions ma y be used as an alternative delivery method. Criterion for Loss of Asthma Control (LOAC) – Based on Increased Nebulizer Use (in e-CRF): The criterion for LOAC based on a patients increased nebulizer use and the nebulizer -to-puff conversion factor (see tables below), is determined as follows: Study personnel will convert salbutamol/albuterol nebulizer and levosalbutamol/levalbuterol nebulizer use as shown on the following tables: Salbutamol/Albuterol Nebulizer S olution -Total Daily Dose (mg) Number of Puffs* 2.5 4 5.0 8 7.5 12 10 16 *Conversion factor: salbutamol/albuterol nebulizer solution (2.5 mg) corresponds to 4 puffs  Example of salbutamol/albuterol nebulizer -to-puff Conversion: Patient received 3 salbutamol/albuterol nebulizer treatments (2.5 mg/treatment) between 7 and 11 AM. Total daily = 7.5 mg or 12 puffs VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

Total daily = 3.75 mg or 12 puffs. After conversion of nebulizer -to-puff, and for every instance that the number of puffs is ≥6 additional puffs of salbutamol/albuterol or lev osalbutamol/levalbuterol in a 24 -hour period (compared to Baseline) on 2 consecutive days in any week, a LOAC event should be documented. 8.3 BLINDING PROCEDURES 8.3.1 Methods of bl inding Dupilumab and placebo will be provided in identically matched pre -filled syringes. To protect the blind, each treatment kit of 0.67 or 1.14 mL (dupilumab/placebo) glass pr e-filled syringes will be prepared such that the treatments (dupilumab and its matching placebo) are identical and indistinguishable and will be labeled with a treatment kit number. The randomized treatment kit number list will be generated by Sanofi. Patients and Investigators will be blinded to assigned treatment. Patients and Investigators will not be blinded to dose regimen as the volumes are different. Patient(s)/parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s), Investigators, and study site personnel will not have access to the randomization (treatment codes) except under circumstances described in Section 8.3.2 . 8.3.2 Randomization code breaking during the study In case of an AE, the code should only be broken in circumstances w hen knowledge of the IMP is required for treating the patient. Code breaking can be performed at any time by using the proper module of the interactive voice response system (IVRS )/interact ive web response system (IWRS ) and/or by calling any other phone number provided by the Sponsor for that purpose. If the blind is broken, the Investigator should document the date, time of d ay and reason for code breaking. VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"
53,page_53,"Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 03 18-Oct-2019 EFC14153 - dupilumab Version number: 1 Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 54 Patient withdrawal will only occur when the code break call is made at the site level, not the study level. This means that if the Emergency Unblinding transaction is performed by the Investigator (ie, at the site level), t hen the subject will be withdrawn from treatment. However, if the Emergency Unblinding transaction is performed by the Global Safety Officer (GSO ) (ie, at the study level, as the GSO is not site based), then the subject will not be withdrawn from treatment. At the facilities where the systemic drug concentration measurements, ADAs and selected biomarkers are determined, the samples will be analyzed prior to data base lock leading to unblinding of respons ible bioanalysts. Bioanalysts are excluded from the clinical trial team. Patient(s)/parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s), Investigators, and site personnel will not have access to assay results for immunoglobulins (immunoglobulin G (IgG ), IgG subclasses, Immunoglobulin A (IgA ), IgM and IgE) after randomization and first administration of study medication , because these values have the potential for unbli nding. Furthermore, neither patient(s)/parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s), Investigators nor site personnel will have access to total IgE, antigen -specific IgE, antigen -specific IgG4, Thymus and Activation -Regulated Chemokine (TARC ) while the study is ongoing, as the related data are not essential for patient care and have the potential for unblinding. The DMC will receive blinded by treatment group or unblinded (if necessary) confidential reports from an independent statistician for review, which have to be handled strictly confidentially. None of these reports can be delivered to unauthorized persons. 8.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMEN T GROUP A randomized treatment kit number list will be generated centrally by Sanofi. The investigational product (dupilumab or placebo) will be packaged in accordance with this list. The Sanofi Clinical Supplies t eam will provide the randomized treatment kit number list and the Study Biostatistician will provide the randomization scheme to the centralized treatment allocation system (IVRS/IWRS). This centralized treatment allocation system will generate the patient randomization list according to which it will allocate the treatments to the patients. Patients who meet the entry criteria will be randomized to receive either dupilumab or placebo. Rescreening is not permitted if the patient fails to meet inclusion criteria. Patients who meet exclusion criteria may be rescreened once during the open Screening Period of the study. There is no requirement for a waiting period between the screen -failure date and the rescreening date. The IVRS/IWRS report will flag rescr eened patients. Patients that are rescreened must have parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) resign a new ICF and sign a new IAF, and all Screening Visit 1 procedures must be repeated. The Investigator obtains treatment kit numbers at randomization and subsequent scheduled visits via an IVRS/IWRS that will be available 24 hours a day. VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"
54,page_54,"Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 03 18-Oct-2019 EFC14153 - dupilumab Version number: 1 Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 55 Patients will be randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive dupilumab or matching placebo. After a patient is randomly assigned to dupilumab or matching placebo, the dosage of dupilumab or matching placebo for the patient, 200 or 100 mg SC once q2w, will be determined based on bw >30 kg or ≤30 kg, respectively. Randomization will be stratified by ICS dose (medium -dose versus high -dose) and eosinophil count (<300 cells/μL versus ≥300 cells/μL) at Screening, and by region. A randomized patient is defined as a patient who is registered and assigned with a treatment kit number from the centralized treatment allocation system, as documented from its log file. A patient cannot be rand omized more than once in the study. 8.5 PACKAGING AND LABELI NG Dupilumab/placebo is supplied as glass prefilled syringes packed in a patient kit box. Each glass prefilled syringe and the patient kit box is labeled. Packaging is in accordance with the administration schedule. The labeling is in accordance with the local regulatory specifications and requirements. 8.6 STORAGE CONDITIONS A ND SHELF LIFE All investigational products should be stored at a temperature between 2°C and 8°C in an appropriate, locked room under the responsibility of the Investigator or other authorized persons (eg, pharmacists) in accordanc e with local regulations, policies, and procedures. Control of IMP storage conditions, especially control of temperature (eg, refrigerated storage) and information on in -use stability and instructions for handling the Sanofi compound should be managed acco rding to the rules provided by the Sponsor. 8.7 RESPONSIBILITIES The Investigator, the hospital pharmacist, or other personnel allowed to store and dispense the IMP will be responsib le for ensuring that the IMP used in the clinical trial is securely maintained as specified by the Sponsor and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. All IMP will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained. Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, pertaining documentation, labeling, expiration date , etc) should be promptly notified to the Sponsor. Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure. VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"
55,page_55,"Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 03 18-Oct-2019 EFC14153 - dupilumab Version number: 1 Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 56 A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator w ill be responsible for promptly addressing any request made by the Sponsor, in order to recall the IMP and eliminate potential hazards. Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party (except for Duties and Taxes paid (DTP ) shipment, for which a courier company has been approved by the Sponsor), allow the IMP to be used other than as directed by this clinical trial protocol, or dispose of IMP in any other manner. 8.7.1 Treatment Accoun tability and Compliance The Investigator or pharmacist will also keep accurate records of the quantities of the IMP dispensed, used and unused. The IMP tracking log and inventory form is to be updated each time investigational product is dispensed. The study monitor will periodically check the supplies of the IMP held by the Investigator or pharmacist to assess accountability. All medication treatment kits (whether empty or unused ) are returned by the parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) at each visit when a treatment dispensing is planned. The completed patient injection diary (returned diary (returned to the site at each visit), returned treatment kit boxes and any unused pre filled syringes will be used for drug accountability purposes. Treatment kit number has to be recorded on the appropriate page of the e -CRF and also on the IMP tracking log and inventory log form. An electronic diary is used by the parent(s)/caregiver(s)/l egal guardian(s) for the daily recording of albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol reliever medication use, daily use of background therapy (ie, medium -dose ICS with a second controller medication [ie, LABA, LTRA, LAMA, or methylxanthines] or high-dose ICS alone or high -dose ICS with second controller), and in case of an exacerbation event, recording of increased ICS dose and/or step up of second controller medication. Site personnel will review and download the electronic diary data at each cl inic visit and will follow up with the parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) accordingly. The Monitoring Team in charge of the study will have to check e -CRF data comparing them with the centralized treatment allocation system information, the IMP kit a nd IMP tracking log and inventory form. For non -investigational medicinal product (NIMP ) not provided by the Sponsor, tracking and reconciliation has to be achieved by the Investigator and must be captured in standard site documents and records (eg, medical notes). 8.7.2 Return and/or Destruction of Treatments All partially used or unused treatment kits will be retr ieved by the Sponsor or destroyed at study site. All used prefilled syringes should be kept in a sharp container by the parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) and be returned to sites for destruction. No unused IMP will be destructed at site unless the S ponsor provides written authorization. VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

Intra -articular steroid s are not allowed to be used in the above mentioned period.  IgE therapy (eg, omalizumab) within 130 days prior to Screening Visit 1, or any other biologic therapy/immunosuppressant to treat inflammatory disease or autoimmune disease within 2 months prior to Screening Visit 1.  Allergen immunotherapy (except if initiated more than 3 months prior to Visit 1 and dose stable 1 month prior to Visit 1).  Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG ) therapy.  Live Attenuated Vaccines: refer to Appendix C . Live (attenuated) vaccines are allowed in the screening period, if taken at least 4 weeks prior to the administration of the first dose of investigational medicinal product (ie, at least 4 weeks prior to baseline visit). In Brazil, for patients in the yellow fever outbreak affected area (see Append ix N).  Asthma relievers other than salbutamol/albuterol or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol: their use is not recommended unless in exceptional circumstances during the study period (eg, prescribed by a physician not participating in the study).  Exposure to another antibody within a time period prior to Visit 1 that is less than 5 half - lives of the antibody. In case the half -life is not known, then the minimum interval since exposure to the prior investigative antibody is 6 months. The minimum interval since exposure to any other (non -antibody) investigative study medication is 30 days prior to Visit 1.  Any investigational treatment or procedure. 8.8.2 Permitted Concomitant Medication  Antihistamines  Dermatological , ocular or intranasal corticosteroids (except for high -potency dermatological corticosteroids ) VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

However, IL -4 was reported to upregulate CYP2E1, 2B6, 3A4 mRNA expression or downregulate CYP1A2 mRNA (5, 6). Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC ) incubated with various Th2 cytokines showed that IL -4 and IL -13 increased mRNA expression of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 (5). Since the clinical significance of the limited in vitro findings for IL -4 and IL -13 involvement in CYP regulation and the impact of dupilumab on CYP enzymes is not fully understood, during the study treatment an d at least up to the end of follow -up, caution should be used for drugs which are metabolized via these CYP isoforms and which have a narrow therapeutic index. This means that close clinical observation and/or laboratory monitoring as applicable are requir ed in order to enable early detection of toxic manifestations or lack of activity/efficacy of these drugs, followed by dose adjustment or their withdrawal if needed ( 6, 7). Some examples of CYP450 substrates with narrow therapeutic index are provided in Appendix D . VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

Spirometry should be performed in accordance with t he ATS/ ERS gui deline s (8). For pre -bronchodilator measured parameters, including FEV1 , peak expiratory flow ( PEF), FVC and FEF 25 -75%, s pirometry will be perfo rmed after a wash out period of bronchodilators according to their action duration, for example, withholding the last dose of salbutamol/albuterol or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol for at least 6 hours, withholding the last dose of LABA for at least 12 hours, and withholding the last dose of LAMA for at least 24 hours. This will be verified before performing the PEF measurements. For post -bronchodilator FEV1 , the measure should follow the steps as that at screening test for reversibility validation . At all vis its, spirometry will be performed either in the AM or PM, but preferred in the AM, and the spirometry should be done at approximately the same time at each visit throughout the study. The same spirometer and standard spirometric techniques, including calibration, will be used to perform spirometry at all visits and, whenever possible, the same person should perform the measurements.

For any subject, the position should be consistent throughout the study. Three measur ement s fulfilling the ATS acceptability and repeatability criteria should be obtained at every visit , if possible . The acceptability criteria must be applied before the repeatability criteria. Unacceptable maneuvers must be discarded before applying the repeatability crite ria. If a subject fails to provide repeatable and/or acceptable maneuvers, an explanation should be recorded. The largest FEV1 and largest FVC should be recorded after the data are examined from all of the acceptable curves, even if they do not come from the same curve. The FEF 25 -75% should be obtained from the single curve that meets the acceptability criteria and gives the largest sum of FVC plus FEV1 (best test). Automated best efforts, which combine FEV1 and FVC are not acceptable. The spirometer must be calibrated following the principles of the ATS/ERS guidelines every day that a study subject is seen and spirometry is carried out. The calibration records should be kept in a reviewable log. It is preferred that the calibration equipment (ie , 3-liter syringe) that is used to calibrate the spirometer be subjected to a validated calibration according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Further details on spirometry will be available in a separate operational manual provided to the sites. 9.2.2.1.2 Reversibility /Post-bronchodilator FEV1 Reversibility is defined as an increase in absolute FEV1 of 10% over the baseline value, demonstrated within 30 minutes of bronchodilator administration. At the screening test, reversibility is tested after the administration of 200 to 400 mcg (2 to 4 puffs) of albuterol/salbutamol or 45 to 90 mcg of (2 to 4 puffs) levalbuterol/levosalbutamol reliever medication from a primed MDI (up to 3 opportunities du ring the same visit are allowed with a maximum of 12 puffs of reliever medication, if tolerated by the patient). Documented reversibility or positive airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine within 12 months prior to Visit 1 is considered acceptable. All reversibility tests will be administer ed after pulmonary function testing and after asthma medicatio ns have been withheld for the appropriate intervals. Patients will receive the albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol reliever medication as puff inhalations using the respective MDI. Alternatively, and only if it is consistent with usual office practice (to be documented), reversibility testing may be performed using inhalation of nebulized albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/lev osalbutamol r eliever medication. The spirometry for measuring absolute FEV1 may be repeated several times within the 30 minutes after administration of bronchodilator. VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

For post -bronchodilator FEV1 at remaining study visits following randomization, the measure should follow the steps as that at screening test for reversibility validatio n except a maximum of 4 puffs of reliever medication can be used . If other attempt for reversibility test was performed at Baseline Visit 2, then the post -bronchodilator FEV1 will come from the result of this reversibility test. 9.2.2.2 Disease -specific, Daily Efficacy Assessments 9.2.2.2.1 Electronic Diary /PEF meter On a daily basis throughout the study, the patient uses an electronic diary/PEF meter to:  Measure morning and evening PEF.  Respond to the morning and evening asthma symptom scale questions.  Indicate the number of inhalations/day of salbutamol/albuterol or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol for symptom relief.  Record the number of inhalations/day of background product used.  Record the number of nocturnal awakenings due to asthma symptoms requiring the use of reliever medication.  Record or al steroids use for exacerbation event . At Screening (Visit 1), patients and parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) will be issued an electronic diary/ PEF meter . Parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) will be instructed on the use of the device, and wr itten instructions on the use of the electronic PEF meter will be provided to the parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s).

Patients and/or parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) are asked to recall how their asthma and/or their child’s asthma, respectively, has been during the previous week and to respond to the symptom questions 1) to 6) on a 7 -point scale (0 = no impairment, 6 = maximum impairment) . After spirometry assessment, patients and/or parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) are asked to recall how their asthma and/or their child’s asthma has been during the previous week and to respond to the symptom and bronchodilator use questions on a 7 -point scale (0=no impairment, 6= maxim um impairment). Clinic staff score s the % predicted FEV1 on a 7 -point scale based on the pre -central reading spirometry result displayed immediately after the testing . The n, the questions are equally weighted and the global ACQ -7 score is the mean of the 7 questions and therefore between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled) (see Appendix F ). Higher score indicates lower asthma control. Patients with a score below 1.0 reflect adequately controlled asthma and patients with scores above 1.0 reflect inadequately controlled asthma. On the 7 -point scale of the ACQ -7, a change or difference in score of 0.5 is the smallest change that can be considered clinically important, corresponding to the MCID defined by the developer. For statistical analysis, ACQ -7 global score is calculated by the sponsor using the BMS post central reading value of the %predicted FEV1 for the question 7 of the q uestionnaire . Measurement properties such as reliability and ability to detect change have been documented in the literature . VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

Higher score indicate s lower asthma control. Patients with a score below 1.0 reflect adequately controlled asthma and patients with scores above 1.0 reflect inadequately controlled asthma. On the 7-point scale of the ACQ -5, a change or difference in score of 0.5 is the smalles t change that can be considered clinically important, corresponding to the MCID defined by the developer. Measurement properties such as reliability and ability to detect change have been documented in the literature (10). 9.2.2.4.2 Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire with Standardized Activitie s–Interviewer Administered The PA QLQ(S) –IA was designed as an interviewer -administered PRO to measure the functional impairments that are most troublesome to children ≥7 years old at Randomization Visit 2 , as a result of their asthma (see Appendix G ). The instrument is comprised of 23 items, each rated on a 7-point Likert scales from 1 to 7. The PAQLQ (S)-IA has 3 domains. The domains and the number of items in each domain are as follows:  Symptoms (10 items)  Activity limitation (5 items)  Emotional function (8 items) A global score is calculated ranging from 1 to 7 and a score by domain. Higher scores indicate better quality of life. The instrument has been used in many clinical trials, and it has been shown to be reliable, valid (patient interviews), and sensitive to change. The MCID for PAQLQ(S) -IA is 0.5 (11). 9.2.3 Safety and Tolerability Endp oints The same safety assessments will be applied across both arms. AEs, including serious adverse events (SAE s) and AEs of special interest (AESI ), will be collected at any time during study. The Investigator wil l ask the patient and parents how he/she has felt since the last study visit. To assure the continuing safety of patients in this study, an independent DMC will be responsible for reviewing the safety data on a periodic basis throughout the course of the s tudy as outlined in Section 6.4.1 .

65,page_65,"Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 03 18-Oct-2019 EFC14153 - dupilumab Version number: 1 Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 66 Safety observations  The Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the patients. Notably, he/she should follow up the outcome of SAEs/AESI until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal or until progression has been stabilized or death. In all cases, this may imply that observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol, and that additional investigations may be requested by the Sponsor.  Patient height will be recorded at randomization as baseline value and compared with last height available duri ng randomized treatment.  When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient.  In case of any SAE/AESI with immediate notification brought to the attenti on of the Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the patient and considered by him/her to be caused by the investigational product with a reasonable possibility, this should be reported to the Sponsor. 9.2.3.1 Adverse Events Adverse events for each patient will be monitored and documented from the time the subject gives informed consent at Visit 1 until the End of Study (EOS ) Visit or till the rollover to the extension study , except for:  SAEs  AEs that are ongoing at database lock. Adverse events, AESIs and SAEs will be reported as described in Section 10.4. 9.2.3.2 Vital Signs Vital signs blood pressure (mmHg), heart rate (beats per minute), respiratory rate (breaths p er minute), body temperature (degrees Celsius), and will include height (cm) and body weight (kg), measured at the Screening and Randomization Visits (Visits 1 and 2) and every subsequent visit. Height will be measured with a proper stadiometer at every vi sit. Stadiometer measurements will be made without patient wearing shoes. Vital signs will be measured at clinic visits, in sitting position, using the same arm at each visit, and prior to administration of investigational product. Refer to Section 1.2 Study Flow Chart for the schedule of vital signs performed throughout this study. 9.2.3.3 ECG Variables One recording of a standard 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG ) will be performed at Screening, EOT, and EOS (see Section 1.2).

All deviations from normal will be recorded, including those attributable to the patient’s disease. Refer to Section 1.2 Study Flow Chart for the schedule of physical examination performed throughout this study. 9.2.3.5 Clinical Laboratory Safety Variables The clinical laboratory tests will be conducted by an accredited (College of American Pathologists or equivalent) central laboratory with national and regional clinical licenses as required for diagnostic testing and must provide evi dence of participation in proficiency testing, as appropriate. After reviewing the laboratory report and evaluating any results that are outside the normal range, the Investigator must sign and date the laboratory report. Abnormal laboratory values that a re considered to be clinically significant by the Investigator should be repeated as soon as possible after receiving the laboratory report to rule out laboratory error. Persistent abnormal laboratory values should be repeated until they return to normal o r until an etiology of the persistent abnormality is determined. Refer to Section 1.2 Study Flow Chart for the desc ription of the clinical laboratory evaluations and the schedule of laboratory evaluations performed throughout this study. The clinical laboratory parameters that will be measured in safety hematology and chemistry blood samples are:  Hematology: To include hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, total white blood cell count with five -part differential count, and total red blood cell count.  Serum chemistry: To include: creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, uric acid, total cholesterol, total prote in, albumin, total bilirubin (in case of values above the normal range, differentiation in conjugated and non -conjugated bilirubin), ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase (ALP ), lactate dehydrogenase, electroly tes (sodium, potassium, chloride), bicarbonate, and CPK. Patients’ fasting or non -fasting status at blood sample collection will be recorded on the Central Laboratory Requisition Form. Fasting is considered as no intake of food or any drink except for wate r for at least 8 hours .  Urine dipstick analysis including specific gravity, pH, glucose, ketones, blood, protein, nitrate, leukocyte esterase, urobilinogen and bilirubin (by dipstick). If any parameter on the dipstick is abnormal, a urine sample should be sent to the central laboratory for testing. If positive for proteins, microscopic analysis is performed by central laboratory.  Clinical laboratory testing at Screening Visit 1 will include HBs -Ag, hepatitis B surface antibody (HBs -Ab), HBc -Ab, HCV -Ab, HIV screen (Anti -HIV-1 and HIV -2 antibodies) and anti -nuclear antibody (ANA ).

The date of collection should be recorded in the patient e -CRF. The date and time also will be collected on the central laboratory requisition form and entered into the database through data transfers from the central laboratory. If an SAE or AESI occurs in a patient, blood samples should be collected for determination of functional dupilumab concentration, and anti -dupilumab antibody assessment at or near the onset and completion of the occurrence of the event, if possible. The exact date and time of samp le collection must be recorded and entered into the database by the central laboratory. An unscheduled systemic drug concentration page in the e -CRF must be completed as well.

At Screening, parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) will be asked to provide information on their child’s vaccination record and schedule, and assess whether immunizing their children with any vaccination for tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis and/or season al trivalent/quadrivalent influenza (as per local medical practice) will result in vaccination during the study. Any patient who will receive planned vaccination for tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis and/or seasonal trivalent/quadrivalent influenza during th e study, will be scheduled to receive the respective vaccination(s) and to have blood samples for antibody titers drawn before and after the respective vaccination(s), as detailed below, and a s shown in the Study Flow Chart ( Section 1.2).

Depending on patient’s vaccination schedule during the course of this study, every effort should be made to draw pre -vaccination titers at either Weeks 6, 12, or 24 (V5, V8, V14) of the Randomized Treatment Perio d, and to draw post -vaccination titers at either Weeks 12, 24, 36 or 50 (V8, V14, V20 , V27 ) of the Randomized Treatment Period (see Study Flow Chart Section 1.2). For patient(s) requiring urgent/emergency vaccination with any seasonal trivalent/quadrivalent influenza and/or any tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccine (eg, flu season approaching, an imal bite, emergency room standard procedures, etc) between Week 6 and Week 44 (ie, Visit 5 and Visit 24, respectively), the actual vaccination(s) may be given by physicians or qualified caregivers outside the study clinic; however, every effort should be made to obtain blood samples for pre - and post -vaccine antibody titers at scheduled draws as described above. Should vaccination be unable to be planned in accordance with other study blood draws (eg, tetanus vaccination for accidental puncture wounds, etc ) as outlined above, at the discretion of the Investigator and with agreement of patient parents or caregiver, additional blood draws may be performed to obtain pre -vaccination and post -vaccination titers. 9.3.1.3 Biomarker endpoints  Change from baseline in fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO ) at Week 12 . Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) will be analyzed using a NIOX instrument (Aerocrine AB, Solna, Sweden), or similar analyzer using a flow rate of 50 mL/s, and reported in parts per billion (ppb ). This assessment should be conducted prior to spirometry and following a fast of at least 1 hour.

To assure optimization of treatment in c hildren, a set of biomarkers related to type 2 inflammation will be assessed at Baseline and after treatment for their association with therapeutic response. In previous asthma trials in adults, treatment with dupilumab significantly suppressed the levels of serum total IgE (a product of immunoglobulin class switching driven by IL -4), antigen -specific IgEs, serum TARC (CCL17; a ligand of CCR4 receptors that attracts Th2 cells), and FeNO (a marker of airway inflammation) baseline values, including blood eosi nophil counts from hematology assays were used to phenotype patients. It is feasible that children may differ from adults in their biomarker profile. Therefore, these biomarkers are included in the current study. In addition, a possible switching in antig en-specific IgE toward the corresponding antigen -specific IgG4 will be assessed in this study to explore the possibility that dupilumab may in part attenuate allergic sensitization. Assay methodologies are briefly summarized below. More detailed informatio n on the collection, handling, transport and preservation of samples (eg, minimum volumes required for blood collection and for aliquots for each biomarker assay) will be provided in a separate laboratory manual. Patient(s)/parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal gua rdian(s), Investigators, and site personnel will be blinded and have no access to any assay results for total IgE, antigen -specific IgEs, antigen -specific IgG4, or TARC, while the study is ongoing, as the related efficacy data are not essential for patient care and have the potential for unblinding the study treatments. 9.4.2.1 Serum Biomarkers Total IgE will be measured with a quantitative method (eg, ImmunoCAP) approved for diagnostic testing. Antigen -specific IgE and antigen -specific IgG4 will be detected using panels of antigens appropriate to the location of the clinical site (quantitative ImmunoCAP test; Phadia). TARC will be assayed with a validated immunoassay. VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

A global score is calculated ranging from 1 to 7 and a score by domain. Higher scores indicate better quality of life. 9.4.2.4.2 Pediatric Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality Of Life Questionnair e–Interviewer Administered in patients with comorbid allergic rhinitis . PRQLQ -IA (see Appendix I ) is an interviewer -administered questionnaire developed to measure HRQoL signs and symptoms that are most problematic in children ≥6 years to <12 years old , as a result of perennial or season al allergic rhinitis. The 23 -item PRQLQ -IA responses are based on 7-point Likert scale with responses ranging from 0 (not troubled) to 6 (extremely troubled). Higher scores indicated more health -related quality of life impairment (lower scores better). The instrument takes approximately 7 minutes to complete. The minimally important difference (MID ) of 0.5 has been established as the minimal important difference indicative of a clinically meanin gful change ( 12). 9.4.2.4.3 Euro Qol (EQ -5D-Y) – for Children The EQ -5D-Y will be completed by children (relates to the quality of life to the child). Those who can read are encouraged to fill the questionnaire by themselves. Those who cannot read, fill it with the help of their adult caregiver (parent/caregiver). The EQ -5D-Y consists of 2 pages, the EQ -5D-Y descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (VAS; see Appendix J ). The descriptive system assesses 5 dimensions but using a child -friendly wording (mobility, looking after myself, doing usual activities, having pain or discomfort, feeling worried, sad or unhappy). Each dimension has 3 levels: no problems, some problems, a lot of problems. The respondent i s asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking (or placing a cross) in the box against the most appropriate statement in each of the 5 dimensions. The EQ VAS records the respondent’s self -rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labelled ‘The best health you can imagine’ and ‘The worst health you can imagine’. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by the individual respondents. Also, previously published studies by EuroQol Gr oup members showed preliminary evidence of the instrument’s feasibility, reliability and validity. VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

The visit schedule should be adhered to within ±3 days for randomized treatment period and ±5 days for post-treatment follow up period. Spirometry should be perfo rmed at all visits as detailed in Section 9.2.2.1.1 , in order to have spirometry performed at approximately the sam e time of the day at each visit throughout the study. Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits and participate in follow -up assessments according to the vi sit schedule until the end of the study with a ±5 day window or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE. At the time of permanent treatment discontinuation, patients will perform the early treatment discontinuation (ETD ) visit with all the assessments defined for the EOT Visit 28. However, patients who discontinue early from treatment will not be eligible for the 1-year long -term extension study. For patients who permanently discontinue the s tudy, under exceptional circumstances where there is no possibility for a patient and p arent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) to come to the site for the scheduled follow -up visit, a phone contact may be made after Sponsor’s approval is given. During that phone contact, at least information about AEs, concomitant medication and asthma exacerbation events must be collected , and the schedule for these calls should still reflect the visit schedule . Patients should be reminded that sexually active female patients of reproductive potential are required to practice effective contraception during the entire study duration, while taking dupilumab and for 12 weeks post last IMP dose. Patients who discontinue early from treatment may be asked to return to the cl inic to have additional ADA samples collected for analysis based on the overall assessment of antibody titers and clinical presentation at the time of discontinuation.

Safety and laboratory assessments 4. IMP administration 10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 10.1.1 Screening Period (Week -5 to Week 0, maximum 35 days prior Day 0) Prior to all screening assessments, the patient and the parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) must sign and date the Ethics Committee (EC ) approved ICF/IAF. The patient assent should be obtained depending on his/her maturity of understanding study associated information. All patient(s)/parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) will receive information on the study objective(s) and procedures from the Investigator. Although the screening a ssessments for this study are grouped under the heading of a single visit in this protocol (see Section 1.2), it is possible for them to be performed over more than 1 site visit if necessary, as long as the screening visit window prior to randomization (Day 1) is respected. If certain dynamic laboratory tests do not meet the eligibility criteria, these laboratory asses sments may be repeated, at the discretion of the Investigator, if it is judged to be likely to return to acceptable range for study inclusion within the screening visit window (4 [±1] weeks or 28-35 days) prior to Day 1. In such an event the patient/parent (s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) do not need to sign a new ICF/IAF and be allocated a new patient number within this same screening window. Patients that fail the initial screening for exclusion criteria, eg, concomitant medications, may be re-screened f or study eligibility one additional time (as described in Section 8.4). For patients re-screened a new ICF/IAF, as applicable, must be signed by patient/parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s), and a new patient number will be allocated. All of the Visit 1 procedures must be repeated (refer to Section 8.4 for further instructions related to re -screening). Patients that fail the Screening Visit due any unforseen administrative or logistic reason (eg, electronic diary/spirometry equipment malfunction, no IMP, etc), or patient -related/site personnel - related unintentional errors, may be re -screened one time aft er approval is granted by the Sponsor’s clinical study director.

Source documents are original documents, data and records such as hospital records, clinic and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, etc. All the data collected in the e -CRF should be transcribed directly from source documents. Data downloade d from the study -associated central laboratories, spirometry, nitric oxide measurement, ECG, and patient electronic diary/PEF meter will be considered source data. 10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANE NT TREATMENT DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DI SCONTINUATION The IMP should be continued whenever possible. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be determined whether the stop can be made temporarily; permanent IMP discontin uation should be a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the e -CRF. In any case, all efforts should be made to maintain the patient for the 12 weeks follow up. VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

Reinitiation of treatment with the IMP will be done under close and appropri ate clinical and/or laboratory monitoring once the Investigator will have considered according to his/her best medical judgment that the responsibility of the IMP(s) in the occurrence of the concerned event was unlikely and if the selection criteria for th e study are still met (refer to Section 7.1 and Section 7.2) AE is sufficiently resolved and unlikely to recur after resuming therapy with IMP. In addition, the following conditions(s) will be cause for temporary treatment discontinuation:  Infections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment  Any laboratory abnormality that meets temporary treatment discontinuation criteria as per Appendix K on Guidelines for management of specific laboratory abnormalities 10.3.2 Permanent Treatment Discontinuation With Investigational Medicinal Product(s) Permanent treatment discontinuation is any treatment discontinuation associated with the definitive decision from the Investigator or the patient not to re -expose the patient to the IMP at any time. 10.3.3 List of Criteria for Permanent T reatment Discontinuation The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Investigato r’s decision. All efforts should be made to document the reasons for treatment discontinuation and this should be documented in the CRF or e-CRF. Patients must be withdrawn from the study (ie, from any further investigational product or study procedure) fo r the following reasons:  At their own request or at the request of their legally authorized representative (Legally authorized representative means an individual or judicial or other body authorized under applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospecti ve patient to the patient’s participation in the procedure(s) involved in the research).  If, in the Investigator’s opinion, continuation in the study would be detrimental to the patient’s well -being  At the specific request of the Sponsor - Including some specific circumstances like the Yellow Fever outbreak in Brazil, where patients from affected areas who are not previously vaccinated with yellow -fever vaccine, are to be permanently discontinued from study drug ( Section 8.8.1 ).  In the event of a protocol deviation, at the discretion of the Investigator or the Sponsor  Any code breaking requested by the Investigator wi ll lead to permanent treatment discontinuation.  Pregnancy VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter will be immediately rechecked for confirmation before making a decision of permanent discontinuation of the IMP for the concerned patient. 10.3.4 Handling of Patients After Permanent Treatment Discontinuation Patients will be followed -up according to the study procedures as specified in this protocol up to the scheduled date of study completion, or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be followed -up as specified in this protocol, whichever comes last. Study Investigators should continue background therapy after treatment discontinuation, as guided by their medical judgment. For patients in Brazil, see Appendix N . Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to return to the clinic for study visits and participate in assessments according to the visit schedule until the EOS with a ± 5 day window or up to recovery or stabiliz ation of any AEs. At the time of permanent treatment discontinuation, patients will perform ETD visit with all the assessments defined for the EOT Visit 28. Patients who permanently discontinue early from treatment will not be eligible for the 1 -year long -term extension study. For patients who permanently discontinue the study, under exceptional circumstances where there is no possibility for a patient and p arent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) to come to the site for the scheduled follow -up visit, a pho ne contact may be made after Sponsor’s approval is given. During that phone contact, at least information about AEs, concomitant medication and asthma exacerbation events must be collected, and the schedule for these calls should still reflect the visit schedule. Patients who discontinue early from treatment may be asked to return to the clinic to have additional ADA samples collected for analysis based on the overall assessment of antibody titers and clinical presentation at the time of discontinuation. All cases of permanent treatment discontinuation should be entered by the Investigator in the e-CRF when considered as confirmed. VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

Withdrawal of consent for follow -up should be accompanied by d ocumentation of the reason for withdrawal. Withdrawal of consent for treatment should be distinguished from withdrawal of consent for follow -up visits and from withdrawal of consent for non -patient contact follow -up, eg, medical records checks. For patien ts who withdraw, the patient and their parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their decision to withdraw consent, and any AE information elicited should be documented. Patient(s)/ paren t(s)/caregiver(s)/legal guardian(s) may withdraw consent verbally or in writing and, if verbal, then the site needs to document in source records that patient withdrew consent verbally. If possible, the patients who withdraw consent will be assessed using the procedures normally planned for the EOT visit and have EOS assessments completed at the same visit or at the last planned visit. For patients who fail to return to the site, the Investigator should make the best effort to re -contact the patient (eg, contacting patient’s family or private physician, reviewing available registries or health care databases), and to determine his/her health status, including at least his/her vital status. Attempts to contact such patients must be documented in the patient ’s records (eg, times and dates of attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter). A subject should only be designated as lost to follow -up, if the site is unable to establish contact with the patient/parent(s)/caregiver(s)/legal gua rdian(s) after 3 documented attempts via 2 different methods (phone, text, e-mail, certified letter, etc) . The statistical analysis plan (SAP ) will specify how these patients lost to follow -up for t heir primary endpoints will be considered. Patients who have withdrawn from the study cannot be rerandomized (treated) in the study. Their inclusion and treatment numbers must not be reused. 10.4 OBLIGATION OF THE IN VESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING 10.4.1 Definitions of Adverse Events 10.4.1.1 Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.

Only asthma exacerbations which fulfill a seriousness criterion should be reported as an AE (as per Section 10.4.1.2 ). For this study, asthma exacerbations should be managed by the Investigators based on their medical judgment and applicable national/int ernational asthma management guidelines. 10.4.1.2 Serious Adverse Event A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  Results in death, or  Is life -threatening, or Note: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  Requires inpati ent hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  Is a medically important event Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in de ciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical int ervention (ie, specific measures or corrective treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for determining which condition has to be considered a medically important event. The list is not intended to be exhaustive: - Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for: - Allergic bronchospasm - Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, myelodysplas ia, pancytopenia, etc), - Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epileptic fit, absence, etc). - Development of drug dependence or drug abuse - ALT >3 x ULN + total bilirubin >2 x ULN or asymptomatic ALT increase >10 x ULN - Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of s uicidality - Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if documented as a consequence of blood sampling) - Bullous cutaneous eruptions VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

Adverse events of special interest may be added, modified or removed during a study by protocol amendment.  Anaphylac tic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require treatment (refer to Appendix L for the definition of anaphylaxis).  Severe injection site reactions that last longer than 24 hours.  An infection that meets at least one of the following criteria: - Any serious infection (that meet any of the SAE criteria) - Requires parenteral (intravenous, intramuscular, SC) antimicrobial therapy. - Requires oral antimicrobial therapy for >2 weeks. - Is a parasitic infection. - Is an opportunistic infection (see list in Appendix M ). Note: antimicrobial therapy refers to antibiotic, antiviral, and antifungal agents.  Significant elevation of ALT ( Appendix K ) - ALT >5 × ULN in patients with baseline ALT ≤2 × ULN; or - ALT >8 × ULN if baseline ALT >2 × ULN  Pregnancy occurring in a female patient entered in the clinical trial or in a female partner of a male patient enter ed in the clinical trial (It is an unlikely event to happen but for safety concerns, it is imperative to query pregnancy involving a male patient entered in the trial). - It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills 1 of the seriousness criteria (see Section 10.4.1.2 ). - In the event of pregnancy in a female participant, IMP should be discontinued. - Follow -up of the pregnancy in a female participant or in a female partner of a male participant is mandatory until the outcome has been determined.  Symptomatic overdose (serious or non -serious) with IMP/NIMP - An overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP/NIMP is an event suspected by the Investigator or spontaneously notified by the patient (not based on sy stematic pills count) and defined as at least twice the intended dose during an interval of less than 11 days. The circumstances (ie, accidental or intentional) should be clearly specified in the verbatim and symptoms, if any, entered on separate AE forms. VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

The Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome, and his/her opinion as to whether there i s a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the IMP or by the study procedure(s). In studies that require the use of combined/multiple IMPs/NIMPs, the GSO with input from other appropriate study team members must determine if the causal relationsh ip will either be assessed for the combined product as a regimen or as distinct entities. The GSO must communicate this decision to the study team for inclusion in the protocol and AE CRF.  The Investigator should take appropriate measures to follow all AEs until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will continue beyond the last pla nned visit per protocol, and that additional investigations may be requested by the monitoring team up to as noticed by the Sponsor. Patients who experience an ongoing SAE or an AESI, at the prespecified study end -date, should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or death and related data will be collected. The duration of poststudy follow -up and reporting of AEs will be specified (eg, until recovery).  When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until the end of the study as defined by the protocol for that patient.  Laboratory, vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if: - Symptomatic and/or VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

In case of a SUSAR, Sanofi Global Pharmacovigilance and Epidemiology will utilize XGRID to reveal medication assignment for regulatory reporting req uirements for the particular case. The Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the conduct of the trial in the clinical study report. 10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 10.6.1 Hypersen sitivity Allergic reaction is a potential risk associated with the administration of most therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Allergic reactions may be defined as allergic reactio n-mediated signs and symptoms experienced by patients during or shortly after the pharmacologic or biologic agent given. These reactions may present in a variety of ways, including dizziness, headache, anxiety, dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, pruritus, rash, urticaria/angioedema, flushing, nausea, or vomiting. Anaphylaxis may represent the most severe form of infusion reaction, but these events may also occur via non -IgE mediated mechanisms (eg, anaphylactoid reactions), or may occur via other immune -mediated mechanisms (eg, cytokine -mediated). Refer to Appendix L “Definition of Anaphylaxis”, which describes the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Patients must be monitored for at least 30 minutes after each study -site administered investigational product administration for any signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. Trained personnel and medications should be available to treat anaphylaxis or any severe allergic reaction if it occurs. Furthermore, the patients will be advised, when the IMP is administered at home, to self -monitor for potential signs and symptoms that may suggest a hypersensitive reaction for at least 30 mi nutes after administration. Anaphylactic reactions or, systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require treatment must be reported as an AESI (within 24 hours, for further details, see AESI definition in Section 10.4.1.3 and Appendix L ) and study medication should be permanently discontinued. Anti-drug antibodies and PK samples will be collected near the onset and resolution of the AESI for any additional analysis . 10.6.2 Severe Injection Site Reactions Based on the SC mode of administration of high doses of protein and on a higher incidence of local injection site reactions observed at the highest IMP d ose level evaluated in adults (300 mg weekly dose), severe injection site reactions, are considered as a potential risk. Patients who experience an injection site reaction must be closely monitored for the possibility of a more intense injection site react ion with a future injection. Any severe injection reaction that lasts over VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"
106,page_106,"Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 03 18-Oct-2019 EFC14153 - dupilumab Version number: 1 Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 107 24 hours will be reported as an AESI with immediate notification. IMP must be temporarily interrupted until the clinical study director (CSD ) has evaluated the case. ADA and PK samples will be collected near the onset and resolution of the AESI for any additional analysis . Prophylactic treatment/premedication for an injection site reaction is not permitted. 10.6.3 Infections Some biologic therapies have been associated with an increased risk of infection, including opportunistic infections. As a precautionary measure, the Investigator is required to carefully monitor for any signs or symptoms of infection such as, but not limited to, increased body temperature, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, or serious febrile systemic illness. A complete diagnostic work -up should be perfor med (ie, cultures for fungi and/or mycobacteria other than tuberculosis, histopathological or cytological evaluation, antigen detection and serum antibody titers). Patients should be referred to an infectious disease specialist if deemed necessary for diag nostic work up and appropriate treatment. Infections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment should have study drug discontinued until the infection is resolved . For any opportunistic infection, such as TB or other infections whose nature or course may suggest an immunocompromised status (See Section 10.3.2 ) patients must be permanently discontinued from study medication. Infections as defined in Section 10.4.1.3 should be reported as AESIs within 24 hours. Since dupilumab binds to IL -4Rα, preventing IL -4 and IL -13 activation of their respective receptors, it inhibits the T -helper 2 (Th2) cytokines pr oduction. Infections with a diversity of helminthic parasites elicit eosinophilia via stimulation of Th2 -like lymphocyte responses. The Th2 response is characterized by production of IL -4, IL -13 and IL -5, subsequently generating IgG1 and IgE -secreting cell s, and eliciting eosinophilia. Eosinophilia is prominent in a number of helminthic parasitic diseases. The eosinophilic response to helminths is determined both by the host's immune response and by the parasite, including its distribution, migration, and d evelopment within the infected host. Therefore, patients treated with dupilumab may potentially have an increased risk of parasitic infection. In order to minimize this risk, any patient with an active parasitic infection should be excluded from the study (see Section 7.2.3 ). Similarly, patients with suspected parasitic infection, or those at high risk of parasitic in fection are also excluded, unless clinical and (if necessary) laboratory assessments have ruled out active infection before randomization. During the study, appearance of signs or symptoms (such as abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea, fever, fatigue hepatosple nomegaly) that could be associated with a parasitic infection should be carefully evaluated, especially if there is a history of parasitic exposure through recent travel to/or residence in endemic areas, especially when conditions are conducive to infectio n (eg, extended stay, rural or heavily populated informal settlements, lack of running water, consumption of uncooked, undercooked, or otherwise VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"

Subsequent medical assessments (eg, st ool exam, blood tests) must be performed in order to rule out parasitic infection/infestation (see also Section 10.4.1.3 ). 10.6.4 Elevated Liver Function Tests No preclinical and clinical data has suggested any hepatic toxicity of dupilumab; however, as a general consideration of clinical development, the administration of immunosuppressant or immunomodulating agents may represent an additional risk factor for hepatotoxicity. Hepatitis virus tests and liver function tests (LFT ), will be performed at Screening Visit 1, prior to randomization to exclude those patients with high risk of hepatitis infection or severe liver injury from this study ( see Section 7.2.3 ). In order to closely follow potential liver abnormalities , assessment of total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, ALT, AST, and ALP are measured as part of the clinical laboratory testing. Clinical laboratory testing at Screening Visit 1 adds hepatitis screen (HBs -Ag, HBs -Ab, IgM and total-HBc-Ab, and HVC -Ab). Guidance for the investigation of elevated LFTs is provided in Appendix K . 10.7 ADVERSE EVENTS MONIT ORING All events will be managed and reported in compliance with all applicable regulations, and included in the final clinical study report.

The sample size calculation assumes a linear discontinuation rate (20% at 1 year), thus the average exposure duratio n for patients is 0.9 year. The assumed relative risk reductions are based on the results in the phase 3 asthma study EFC13579 (QUEST) . To achieve target sample size for each of the population s stated above, approximately 402 patients in the overall popula tion (268 for dupilumab and 134 for placebo) need to be randomized assuming approximately 86% of the randomized patients have type 2 inflammat ory phenotype (baseline blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/μL or baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb ), approximately 81% of the random ized patients have baseline blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/μL, and approximately 64% of the randomized patients have baseline blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/μL. Patients will be randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive dupilumab or matching placebo. After a patient is randomly assigned to dupilumab or matching placebo, the dosage of dupilumab or matching placebo for the patient, 200 or 100 mg SC once q2w, will be determi ned based on baseline body weight >30 kg or ≤30 kg, respectively.

It assesses the benefits of the treatment policy or strategy relative to placebo. In this primary approach, off -treatment measure ments of patients who prematurely discontinue treatment will be included for the analysis. Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits. If a patient stays in study till the end of 52 -week treatment period, all severe exacerbation events that happen up to Week 52 will be included in the primary analysis, regardless if the patient is on -treatment or not. If a patient withdraws from study prior to the end of 52 -week treatment period, all observed severe exacerbation events up to the last contact date will be included in the analysis, and the observation duration is defined as from randomization to the last contact date. No imputation will be performed for the unobs erved events that may happen after study discontinuation and up to Week 52. The annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbation events will be analyzed using a negative binomial regression model to confirm the effectiveness of dupilumab. The analysis for th e annualized severe exacerbation rate will be performed in the type 2 inflammatory phenotype, baseline blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/μL, baseline blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/μL, baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb and full ITT populations using appropriate multiplicity control. When performing the primary endpoint analysis in the type 2 inflammatory phenotype, baseline blood eosinophils ≥150 cells/μL or the full ITT populations, t he model will include the total number of events of each patient occurring during the 52 wee ks as the response variable, with the treatment group, age, weight (≤30kg, >30kg), region, baseline eosinophil level (<300 cells/ μL, ≥300 cells/μL), baseline FeNO level (<20 ppb, ≥ 20 ppb ), baseline ICS dose level (medium/high), and number of severe asthma exacerbation events prior to the study as covariates. When performing the primary endpoint analysis in the baseline blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/μL population, the baseline eosinophil level will be removed from th e model covariates. When performing the primary endpoint analysis in the baseline FeNO ≥20 ppb population, the baseline FeNO level will be removed from the model covariates. Severe asthma exacerbation event prior to the study is defined as treatment with a systemic steroid (oral or parenteral) for worsening asthma at least once or hospitalization or emergency medical care visit for worsening asthma (as defined in this protocol).

In this approach, the severe exacerbation events reported after the premature treatment discontinuation will be excluded from the analysis. Any measurement obtained after the first permanent stepping -up of background asthma medication will also be excluded fr om the analysis. The supportive analysis will be performed in the type 2 inflammatory phenotype and baseline blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/μL populations and will use a negative binomial model with the same set of covariates as specified for the primary ana lysis in the two populations.

Number, reasons and timing of the missing data will be summarized by treatment groups. In the primary analysis, all observed data will be used regardless of treatment adherence or increase of asthma background medication. No imputation will be conducted for the missing severe exacerbation information after a patient prematurely withdraws from the study up to Week 52. In addition, sensitivity ana lyses based on pattern mixture model, placebo based pattern mixture model and tipping point analysis based on the same negative binomial model as being used in the primary analysis may be conducted to assess the robustness of the conclusion of the main mod el.

Patients who discontinue IMP must continue to be followed in the study until EOS ( Section 10.3.4 ). Section 9.3.1.1.1 Sampling time ( Section 9.3.1.1.1 ) Predose blood samples will be collected for determination of functional dupilumab concentration in serum and anti -dupilumab antibodies (including neutralizing antibodies) on days designated in the Study Flow Chart (see Section 1.2 as well as Section 10.3.4 , as needed for Brazil ). Section 10.3.3 List of criteria for permanent discontinuation ( Section 10.3.3 )  At the specific request of the Sponsor - Including some specific circumstances like the Yellow Fever outbreak in Brazil, where patients from affected areas who are not previously vaccinated with yellow -fever vaccine, are to be permanently discontinued from study drug ( see below ). Section 10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation (Section 10.3.4 ) In Brazil, any patient who is permanently discontinued from treatment with study drug due to the Yellow Fever outbreak must complete all EOT procedures. These patients should continue to be followed in the study until EOS. Specific blood samples for ADA, dupilumab PK, and pre-vaccination Yellow Fever antibody titer should be performed, when possible, prior to vaccination in patients who received dupilumab. Post -vaccine blood samples for ADA, PK, and Yellow Fever antibody titers will also be collected following the appropriate interval (4 -6 weeks after vaccination and may be extended up to 8 weeks) . A specific ICF must be signed prior to collection of these samples ( See below ). Brazilian patien ts who are discontinued early from treatment due to the Yellow Fever outbreak will remain eligible for the 1 year long term extension study. Section 12.2 Informed consent ( Section 12.2) For Brazil, a country -specific ICF will be issued for the collection of additional blood samples for the assessment of pre and post Yellow Fever vaccination titers, dupilumab PK, and ADA levels.

Assuming the number of severe exacerbations follows a negative binomial dis tribution with a dispersion parameter of 1.5, a placebo annualized rate of exacerbations being 1.0, a randomization ratio of 2:1, with 294 randomized patients (196 for dupilumab and 98 for matching placebo group), the study will have approximately 90% powe r to detect a 50% relative risk reduction (ie, annualized rate of 0.5 for the dupilumab group) in the annualized rate of severe exacerbations at the 2 - tailed significance level of α=0.05. This calculation assumes a linear discontinuation rate (20% at 1 yea r), thus the average exposure duration for patients is 0.9 year. Patients will be randomized (2:1 ratio) to receive dupilumab or matching placebo. After a patient is randomly assigned to dupilumab or matching placebo, the dosage of dupilumab or matching placebo for the patient, 200 or 100 mg SC once q2w, will be determined based on bw >30 kg or ≤30 kg, respectively. Randomization will be stratified by ICS dose (medium -dose versus high dose) and eosinophil count (<300 cells/μL versus ≥300 cells/μL) at Scree ning, and by region.

Change: Increase in study sample size. Reason for change : Due to an update on the assumptions used to perform the sample size calculation. The original effective size assumption was based on the observed risk reduction in the dupilumab Phase 2b study in adult patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma. This assumption i s being updated based on the effect size observed in the recently concluded Phase 3 dupilumab clinical trial in adult and adolescent patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma. The sample size is adjusted to maintain 90% power based on a more accurate es timation of treatment effect from a larger clinical study. Change in sample size VV-CLIN-0528583 6.0"
