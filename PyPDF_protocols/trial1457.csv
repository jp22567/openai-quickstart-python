DLBCL accounts for nearly one -third (32.5%) of NHL. Chemo -immunotherapy, with or without radiotherapy, is the most common initial treatment for DLBCL. Respon se to initial treatment is high; however, a significant proportion of patients relapse. The current standard of care for relapsed DLBCL is additional chemotherapy, which can be followed by stem cell transplantation (SCT). The poor prognosis for relapsed patients, especially those with chemo-refractory disease with a short interval between remission and relapse, or those who relapse after high -dose therapy and SCT, highlights the unmet needs for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. Human CD19 antigen is a 95 kd transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. In normal human tissue, expression of CD19 continues through pre -B and mature B- cell differentiation until it is finally down-regulated during terminal differentiation into plasma cells ; however, expression of CD19 is maintained in hematologic B -cell malignancies, including DLBCL. Loncastuximab tesirine (ADCT -402) is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) that has been designed to target and kill CD19-expressing malignant B -cells. Preliminary data from a Phase 1 study of loncastuximab tesirine in relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL shows significant activity in patients with DLBCL. Objectives: Primary Objective • Evaluate the efficacy of single agent loncastuximab tesirine in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL Secondary Objectives • Characterize the safety profile of loncastuximab tesirine • Characterize the pharmacokinetic ( PK) profile of loncastuximab tesirine • Evaluate the immunogenicity of loncastuximab tesirine • Evaluate the impact of loncastuximab tesirine treatment on health -related quality of life (HRQoL)"

The study will enroll approximately 140 patients . A 2-stage design will be used, with an interim analysis for futility on the first 52 patients. If ≥ 10 patients respond (CR+PR), the study will proceed to complete full enrollment. Enrollment will continue during the interim analysis; however, further enrollment will be halted if futility is confirmed."

Any other significant medical illness, abnormality, or condition that would, in the Investigator’s judgment, make the patient inappropriate for study participation or put the patient at risk Estimated Duration of Patient Participation and Study Duration: The duration of the study participation for each patient is defined as the time from the date of signed written informed consent to the completion of the follow -up period, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow - up, or death, whichever occurs first. The study will include a Screening Period (of up to 28 days), a Treatment Period (cycles of 3 weeks), and a Follow- up Period (approximately every 12 week visits for up to 3 years after treatment discontinuation). Patients may continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other discontinuation criteria , whichever occurs first . The end of study occurs at the last visit or last scheduled procedure for the last patient , unless the study is terminated earlier by Sponsor . Efficacy Assessments: • Disease assessments: Positron emission tomography - computed tomography (PET -CT) Note: If disease is not PET -avid at baseline, CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used for follow -up disease assessments. The assessment method determined to identify sites of disease at baseline should be used for all subsequent assessments. Safety Assessments: • Physical examination • ECOG Performance status • Height and weight • Vital signs • Safety laboratories (hematology, chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis) • Pregnancy test, if applicable • 12 Lead -ECG (triplicate) • AEs/SAEs, graded according to CTCAE version 4.0. Other Assessments: • Blood sampling for PK, ADA, • • HRQoL: EQ -5D-5L and FACT -Lym Study Drug, Dosage, and Mode of Administration: Loncastuximab tesirine will be administered as an intravenous ( IV) infusion over 30 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle. Patients will receive 150 µg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W ) for 2 cycles, then 75 µg/kg Q3W for subsequent cycles. Patients with a body mass index ( BMI) ≥35 kg/m2 will have their dose calculated based on an adjusted body weight . Sample Size: Approximately 140 patients."

Sample Size Justification: Using nQuery exact test for single proportion , a sample size of 140 patients has >99% power to achieve a 1 -sided significance level of 0.025 (2 -sided significance level of 0.05). This sample size will provide a dequate pre cision for observed ORR in the expected range and a robust population for safety evaluation. Statistical A nalysis: ORR and CR rate with 95% CI from all treated patients will be presented. DOR, PFS, RFS, and OS will be analyzed by Kaplan -Meier approach. Safety analyses will be presented descriptively."

It is the 7th most common type of cancer in the US and will account for an estimated 4.3% (n=72,240) of ne w cancer cases in 201 7 (Siegel et al. , 2017). D iffuse large B -cell lymphoma (DLBCL) accounts for an estimated 32.5% of NHL (Al-Hamadani et al. , 2015). Approximately 30% to 50% of patients with DLBCL are not cured, and most patients who fail a rituximab -containing chemotherapy regimen (e.g., R -CHOP) will die from their disease. Salvage therapy , including high- dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell tr ansplant (HD-ASCT) , can be effective treatment for DLBCL patients with chemotherapy- sensitive relapse. H owever, over half of the patients treated in this fashion will not have long term disease control (Gisselbrecht et al. , 2010) . The prognosis of patients whose disease is refractory to initial chemotherapy and are therefore not eligible for HD -ASCT, or who relapse early after HD -ASCT , is extremely poor. These patients have a poor response to salvage therapy, with an objective response rate (ORR) of 26% (complete response [CR] rate 7%) and a median survival of approximately 6 months ( Crump et al. , 2017). The management of patients with DLBCL who are ineligible for HD -ASCT or who relapse after HD -ASCT is difficult. Palliation, second HD -ASCT , or allogeneic stem cell transplant (AlloSCT) are some of the options available for these patients but results are dismal and toxicity significan t. The poor prognosis for relapsed patients, especially those with chemotherapy- refractory disease with a short interval between remission and relapse or those who relapse after high- dose therapy and stem cell transplant (SCT), highlights the unmet needs for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL (Coiffier, 2016; Epperla , 2017 ). In late 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) granted approval to the autologous anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR) T-cell therapy, axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta®), for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory large B -cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including DLBCL not otherwise specified, primary mediastinal large B -cell lymphoma, high- grade B -cell lymphoma, and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma. While this therapy does provide disease control in a portion of patients (51% CR, 21% partial response [ PR]), and provides durable responses in patients who achieve a CR, the duration of response (DOR) is short for patients who only achieve a PR (2.1 months), meaning that a significant fraction of patients (approximately 50%) treated with this therapy will not have long- term disease control. In addition, this therapy has significant toxicity, with 94% of patients having cytokine release syndrome (13% Grade 3 or higher) and 57% having encephalopathy (29% Grade 3 or higher). It is only available at specialized centers and requires substantial l ead-time for preparation, with approximately 10% of patients being unable to receiv e the planned therapy. Thus, the development of more effective salvage treatment remains an unmet medical need."

The toxin SG3199 attached to the linker is designated as SG3249. The schematic representation of loncastuximab tesirine is presented in Figure 1 . Figure 1. Schematic Representation and Chemical Structure of Loncastuximab Tesirine Abbreviations: Ala, alanine; PABA, para -aminobenzoic acid; PEG, polyethylene glycol; RB4v1.2, human monoclonal antibody being studied; Val, valine. Loncastuximab tesirine binds with picomolar affinity to human CD19. After binding and internalization, loncastuximab tesirine traffics to the lysosomes, where the protease- sensitive linker is cleaved and unconjugated PBD dimers (SG3199) are released inside the target cell. The released PBD dimers bind in the minor groove of DNA and form potent cytotoxic DNA interstrand cross -links. The cross- links result in a stalled DNA replication fork, blocking cell division and causing cell death (Hartley , 2011). The cross- links formed by PBD dimers are relatively non -distorting to the DNA structure, making them hidden to repair mechanisms (Adair et al ., 2012; Beck et al. , 2017 )."

The study design involves a dose escalation phase (Part 1) followed by a dose expansion phase (Part 2) . The primary objectives for Part 1 were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of loncastuximab tesirine and to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended dose(s) to use in Part 2. The primary objective for Part 2 was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the dose(s) determined in Part 1. The secondary objectives include evaluating the clinical activity of loncastuximab tesirine as measured by ORR, DOR, progression free survival ( PFS), and overall survival (OS ). As of data cut -off date of 03 December 2017, a total of 144 patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL received at least one infusion of loncastuximab tesirine . The median age was 63.5 years (range: 23 -86). The median number of previous chemotherapy regimens was 3 (range: 1 -10) with 24.3% of patie nts ha ving prior stem cell transplant. Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 137 (95.1%) out of 144 patients treated with loncastuximab tesirine . The most common TEAE s (observed in at least in 15% of patients), regardless of relationship to study treatment , were fatigue (42.4%); nausea (27.1%); gamma -glutamyltransferase (GGT) increased (26.4%); anemia (25.7%); edema peripheral (25.0%); dyspnea (18.8%); neutrophil count decreased, platelet count decreased, and thrombocytopenia (18.1% each); rash (17.4%); abdominal pain (16.0%); neutropenia (16.0% ); and constipation (15.3%). Grade ≥3 TEAEs were reported in 92 (63.9%) patients. The most common Grade ≥3 TEAEs (observed in at least in 5% of patients) were neutrophil count decreased (16.0%); GGT increased (14.6%); anemia (12.5%); platelet count decreased (11.8%); neutropenia (11.1); and thrombocytopenia (8.3%). The following events were considered non- serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs): GGT increased, edema (includes peripheral and facial), neutrophil count decreased, platelet count decreased, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and skin- related events (such as rash, maculopapular rash, and erythema). TEAEs in 16 (11.1%) patients led to treatment discontinuation. Dose- limiting toxicity was reported in 3 patients (2 thrombocytopenia and 1 febrile neutropenia). Serious adverse events ( SAEs ) were reported in 54 (37.5%) out of 144 patients. Of these, 24 patients experienced an SAE(s) considered at least possibly related to study drug. Six of the possibly related events were observed in multiple patients (febrile neutropenia in 5 patients, pyrexia in 3 patients, dyspnea in 2 patients, lung infection in 2 patients, pleural effusion in 2 patients, and sepsis in 2 patients). Preliminary data indicate an acceptable safety profile. Febrile neutropenia and pleural effusion have been classified as expected serious ADRs."

24,page_24,"ADC Therapeutics Loncastuximab Tes irine ADCT -402-201 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4 Date of Protocol Amendment 4: 09 July 2019 Page 24 2 Study Rationale Human CD19 antigen is a 95 kd transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. In normal human tissue, expression of CD19 continues through pre-B and mature B -cell differentiation until it is finally down -regulated during terminal differentiation into plasma cells (Scheuermann , 1995) ; however, expression of CD19 is maintained in hematologic B-cell malignancies, including DLBCL. Loncastuximab tesirine is an ADC that has been designed to target and kill CD19 -expressing malignant B -cells. Preliminary data from a Phase 1 study of loncastuximab tesirine in relapsed or refractory B -cell NHL (Section 1.3) shows significant activity of loncastuximab tesirine with an acceptable safety profile in patients with DLBCL. 2.1 Rationale for Study Design This is a Phase 2 , open- label , single -arm study and will enroll approximately 1 40 patients. The primary objective will be to evaluate the efficacy of single agent loncastuximab tesirine in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL who have failed at least 2 multi -agent systemic therapy regimens . The primary hypothesis is that the ORR based on central review in all patients treated with loncastuximab tesirine is significantly greater than 20%. With the null hypothesis that the true response rate is 20%, and the alternative hypothesis that the true response rate is significantly greater than 20% (40% is used for calculation), the design controls the type I error rate at 0.025 and yields a power of >99%. To enhance patient safety, a 2 -stage design will be used, with an interim analysis for futility on the first 52 patients. If ≥10 patients respond, the study will proceed to complete full enrollment. Enrollment will continue during the interim analysis; h owever, further enrollment will be halted if futility is confirmed to minimize exposure of patients in the study. Given the encouraging ORR reported with loncastuximab tesirine in the P hase 1 study at dose levels below the MTD and the acceptable safety profile to date , loncastuximab tesirine presents a positive risk-benefit for further evaluation in relapse and refractory DLBCL. 2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection For patients with relapsed or refractory non -Hodgkin lymphoma, available data su pport a loncastuximab tesirine dosing regimen of 150 µg/kg every 3 weeks ( Q3W ) × 2 cycles, followed by a 50% reduction to 75 µg/kg Q3W for the P hase 2 trial. For safety, particular differences in predicted probabilities (pp) were apparent between the 200 µg/kg Q3W and 150 µg/kg Q3W doses, respectively, including Grade ≥3 edema (pp=0.2817 vs. 0.1070 in patients with prior stem cell transplant), liver function test -related toxicities (pp=0.4018 vs. 0.1644 in patients with prior relapsed disease; 0.4018 vs. 0.1644 in patients without prior stem cell transplant; pp=0.5208 vs. 0.2203 in patients with body mass index [ BMI ] of 35 kg/m2, and pp=0.4018 vs. 0.1644 in patients with baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG ] of 0 or 1, respectively), and neutropenia or neutrophil decrease (pp=0.4383 vs. 0.2865)."
25,page_25,"ADC Therapeutics Loncastuximab Tes irine ADCT -402-201 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4 Date of Protocol Amendment 4: 09 July 2019 Page 25 For efficacy, the decision for initial dosing at the 150 µg/kg dose level is predicated on higher observed and predicted ORR as compared to the 120 µg/kg and lower doses. The decision to dose reduce following 2 cycles of treatment was based on the rapid onset of response observed in a majority of patients (median 2 cycles), and desire to mitigate onset of late -developing and difficult to manage toxicities, such as edema. Initial dosing for 2 cycles is anticipated to optimize the frequency of objective response, while dose reduction in subsequent cycles will permit continued exposure with manageable toxicity to optimize the durability of response."

The study will enroll approximately 140 patients. A 2-stage design will be used (Simon , 1989) , with an interim analysis for futility using the data on the first 52 patients (see Section 9.3). If ≥10 patients respond (CR+PR) , the study will proceed to complete full enrollment. Enrollment will conti nue during the interim analysis; however, further enrollment will be halted if futility is confirmed. The duration of the study participation for each patient is defined as the time from the date of signed written informed consent to the completion of the follow -up period, withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up, or death, whichever occurs first. The study will include a Screening Period (of up to 28 days), a Treatment Period (cycles of 3 weeks), and a Follow -up Period (approximately every 12 week visits for up to 3 years after treatment discontinuation). 4.2 Screening Period Informed consent must be obtained for each patient and documented with a signed informed consent form (ICF) prior to any study procedures . Procedures that are performed as part of standard of care ( SOC) may be used to satisfy screening requirements if they are performed in the appropriate window. The screening period is from 28 days to 1 day prior to the start of the study drug. The screening assessments should be performed within this period in order to assess the eligibility of the patient against the inclusion and exclusion criteria ( Section s 5.1 and 5.2, respectively). See Section 5.3 for the information to be collected on screening failures. 4.3 Treatment Period The treatment period starts on the date when a patient receives the first dose of study drug and continues until the date of discontinuation from treatment. A treatment cycle is defined as 3 weeks (i.e., 21 days). Loncastuximab tesirine will be administered as an intravenous ( IV) infusion over 30 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle. Patients will receive 150 µg/kg Q3W for 2 cycles, then 75 µg/kg Q3W for subsequent cycles. Patients m ay continue treatment for up to one year or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity , or other discontinuation criteria (Section 7), whichever occurs first. Additionally, patients benefitting clinically at 1 year may continue treatment after a case by case review with the Sponsor."

The amount of the product to be diluted will depend on the dose level and the body mass of the patient. Patients will receive a 30 minutes IV infusion of loncastuximab tesirine on Day 1 of each cycle. Variations in infusion times due to minor differences in IV bag overfill/underfill and the institution ’s procedure for flushing chemotherapy lines will not result in protocol deviation. 6.2.3 Accountability The Investigator will maintain accurate records of receipt of all study drugs, including dates of receipt. In addition, accurate records will be kept regarding when and how much study drug is dispensed and used by each patient in the study. Reasons for departure from the expected dispensing regimen must also be recorded. All study drugs will be reconciled and retained or destroyed according to applicable regulations. 6.3 Loncastuximab Tesirine Dosing Administration of loncastuximab tesirine will be performed by the Investigator or a qualified designee. Loncastuximab tesirine will be administered as an IV infusion over 30 minutes on Day 1 of each cycle ( every 3 weeks) at a dose of 150 µg/kg Q3W for 2 cycles, then 75 µg/kg Q3W. Refer to Section 6.6 for premedication and supportive care. Patients with a BMI ≥35 kg/m2 will have their dose calculated based on an adjusted body weight as follows: Adjusted body weight (ABW) in kg = 35 kg/m2 * (height in meters)2 Dose to administer (mg) = dosage (µg/kg) * ABW / 1000 Extravasation of loncastuximab t esirine may be associated with local irritation, swelling, pain, or tissue damage. The IV infusion site should be monitored for signs of IV infiltration or drug extravasation, and patients should be instructed to report immediately any signs of IV infiltration or drug extravasation during or after the infusion. Suspected extravasation o f loncastuximab t esirine should be managed according to institutional protocol for management of extravasation of cytotoxic chemotherapy. For patients who have a central line, administration of loncastuximab tesirine via this central line should be consid ered. 6.4 Dose Delays and Modifications If a patient experiences any Grade ≥3 (≥2 for edema, effusion, or increased AST/ALT/GGT ) non-hematologic toxicity, loncastuximab tesirine must be held until the toxicity resolves to Grade ≤1 (Grade 1 or baseline for peripheral neuropathy) . In addition, if a patient experiences hematological toxicity of Grade ≥3 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia , loncastuximab tesirine must be held until the toxicity resolves to Grade ≤2. If loncastuximab tesirine dosing is delayed by more than 3 weeks and the toxicity is considered at least possibly related to loncastuximab tesirine , then subsequent doses of loncastuximab tesirine will be reduced by 50%. In addition, the Investigator may reduce the dose of loncastuximab tes irine by 50% for any Grade ≥3 (≥2 for edema, effusion , or increased"

If toxicity requiring dose reduction as described above occurs following the second dose of 150 µg/kg (C2D1) , the patient should receive the per protocol -defined dose of 75 µg/kg for Cycle 3 . If toxicity as described above recurs at the reduced dose, subsequent doses of loncastuximab tesirine will be reduced by an additional 50%. If toxicity as described above recurs after a second dose reduction, study drug must be discontinued permanently. If loncastuximab tesirine dosing is delayed by more than 5 weeks and the toxicity is considered at least possibly related to loncastuximab tesirine, study drug must be discontinued permanently unless continued administration is approved by the Sponsor. 6.5 Overdose Management An overdose is any dose of study drug given to a patient that exceeds the dose described in the protocol. There are no data available to determine what the effects of overdose are and whether they can be reversed. Symptomatic treatment and standard supportive care measu res for the management of any observed toxicity should be applied. 6.6 Premedication and Supportive care 6.6.1 Premedication Unless contraindicated, administer dexamethasone 4 mg per os ( PO) twice daily (BID) the day before loncastuximab tesirine administration (if possible), the day of loncastuximab tesirine administration (give at least 2 hours prior to administration when not given the day before; otherwise any time prior to administration), and the day after loncastuximab tesirine administratio n. Patients who experience an infusion- related hypersensitivity reaction will receive the alternative prem edication regimen specified in Section 6.6.3. 6.6.2 Treatment of Edema and Pleural Effusion Spironolactone at standard doses should be administered for patients with weight gain greater than 1 kg from C1D1, new or worsening edema, and/or new or worsening pleural effusion. The dose of spironolactone may be titrated as clinically indicated. Additional diuretic sup port may be added if there is further increase in weight, edema, or pleural effusion. Additionally, patients should be advised to monitor their weight on a daily basis, at around the same time ( preferably in the morning) , and to notify the study site if they gain >1 kg (2.2 pounds) over baseline."

Any patient who experiences an infusion- related hypersensitivity reaction should receive prophylactic treatment in subsequent cycles according to the guidelines below or institutional standard of care : • On Day 1 of each cycle, patients will be instructed to take dexamethasone 20 mg PO 12 and 6 hours before the start of the loncastuximab tesirine infusion. When necessary, 12 and 6 hours before the first infusion may be defined as “immediately before sleeping ” and “immediately after waking up.” • On Day 1 of each cycle, patients will be given diphenhydramine hydrochloride 50 mg IV 30 minutes before the start of the loncastuximab tesirine infusion. • On Day 1 of each cycle, patients will be given ranitidine (or equivalent) 50 mg IV 30 minutes before the start of the loncastuximab tesirine infusion. • For 2 days following administration of loncastuximab tesirine on Day 1, patients are to take dexamethason e 4 mg PO BID. 6.6.4 Skin R ash Skin rash has been reported in the ADCT -402- 101 study, as well as with another investigational agent containing the same PBD warhead (Rudin et al. , 2017). The rash has been reported in areas at risk for sun exposure ; it is therefore recommended that precautions are taken to avoid prolonged exposure of skin to sunlight. 6.6.5 Other Supportive Care • Although the study patient population has a low risk for development of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) compared to patients with acute disease ( Cairo et al. , 2010) , patients should be observed for development of TLS and treated according to site standard treatment protocols. • As testing in animals showed testicular toxicity (atrophy with reduced spermatogenesis), male patients are advised to consider cryopreservation of sperm prior to treatment with loncastuximab tesirine , where applicable. 6.7 Concomitant Medications and Procedures All medications (except for the study drug) and procedures will be recorded in the eCRF starting from the ICF signature date or from 14 days prior to C1D1, whichever is earlier , and continuing until at least 30 days after last dose of study drug."

Note: Once discontinued from the study for any reason, patients are not permitted to be re-enrolled. 7.1 Discontinuation from Study Treatment A patient may be discontinued from the study drug for any of the following reasons: • Disease progression • Unacceptable toxicity • Patient decision • Major protocol deviation • The Investigator determines that it is in the best interest of the patient to discontinue study treatment. • Discontinuation of the study by the Sponsor • Pregnancy • Death IMPORTANT: Study drug discontinuation is not to be automatically considered as withdrawal from the study. Patient s discontinuing the study drug will be asked to perform an EOT visit (Section 4.4) and continue with the Follow-up period ( Section 4.5) as per protocol. The investigational site should make every effort to complete follow -up per protocol. If patients are unable to return to the site, patient status, including but not limited to survival status, may be obtained by site staff via phone, email, or mail. 7.2 Discont inuation from the Study A patient may be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons: • Withdrawal of consent • Investigator/Sponsor decision • Death • Loss to follow-up If a patient withdraws informed consent, no additional data will be collecte d. The Sponsor may continue to use previously collected medical research data prior to the withdrawal consistent with the original authorization. The study may be terminated at any time , for any reason, by the Sponsor. Patients still receiving study drug should have an EOT visit as described in Section 4.4 and SoE ( Table 1 ). 7.3 Loss to Follow -Up Patients who fail to return for protocol follow -up are to be contacted by the investigative site. Following a minimum of two documented unsuccessful telephone calls, the investigative site should send a registered letter to the patient in a final attempt to ensure protocol compliance."

Results (e.g., from laboratory tests or radiographic evaluations, etc.) obtained prior to the date of informed consent but within the allowed timeframe for screening may be used for determination of pati ent eligibility only if obtained as part of standard care. 8.1 Efficacy Assessments Disease assessments will occur as per schedule of events ( SoE) (Table 1 ) until progression. Disease assessments should take place at the timepoints specified even if study drug dosing is delayed . Additional disease assessments may be obtained , if clinically indicated. Imaging and clinical examination for lymphoma will be performed at all disease assessment timepoints. All patients will have p ositron emission tomography - computed tomography (PET -CT) of the neck/chest/abdomen/pelvis and other areas of known or suspected disease performed at baseline. Patients with PET -avid disease at baseline should have PET -CT for all subsequent disease assessments. If disease is not PET -avid at baseline, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used for subsequent disease assessments. Patients whose disease is not PET -avid should have a bone marrow biopsy as part of their baseline staging and disease assessment if clinically appropriate. Screening (Baseline) imaging must be performed within 4 weeks prior to C1D1. During the treatment period, imaging will be per formed 6 weeks and 12 weeks after C1D1, then every 9 weeks until EOT. Week 6 imaging should be performed within 5 days prior to C3D1 and Week 12 imaging should be performed within 5 days prior to C5D1. All other imaging should be performed within ± 2 wee ks of the scheduled time point. During the follow- up period, patients who discontinued study drug for re asons other than disease progression or initiation of other anti -cancer therapy except stem cell transplant, will have imaging performed every 12 (± 2) weeks until 1 year from EOT, then every 6 months until disea se progression, up to 3 years from EOT. Response data will be collected for patients who receive CAR -T therapy until 90 days after receiving CAR -T therapy. If a scan has been perfor med within 8 weeks of EOT, it does not need to be repeated at EOT. In case of dose delays, disease assessment should be maintained at the frequencies defined above. The patient’s response to treatment will be determined according to the 2014 Lugano Classi fication Criteria ( Appendix 2) as CR, PR, stable disease ( SD), or progressive disease (PD). Images will be obtained according to local site imaging protocols and will be submitted for central review. Submission instructions for central review will be provided in a separate manual. Central imaging review will be performed using two blinded independent reviewers with adjudication by a third blinded independent r eviewer in cases of discordance."

Test results collected during the study (e.g., laboratory values, physical examination, ECG s, etc.) or identified from review of other documents may constitute AEs if deem ed clinically significant. A SAE is defined as any AE that: • results in death . • is life threatening . • requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (hospitalization for elective procedures or for protocol compliance is not considered an SAE) . • results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . • is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. • important medical events that do not meet the preceding criteria but based on appropriate medical judgement may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above. 8.2.2 Eliciting and Reporting Adverse Events/Serious Adverse Events Patients will be instructed to contact the Investigator at any time after ICF signature if any symptoms de velop. At each study visit, patients will be asked a non- leading question to elicit any medically related changes in their well -being. Patients may also report AEs voluntarily and they will be instructed to contact the Investigator between visits if any symptoms develop or worsen. AEs will be reported starting when the patient provides written informed consent. Clinically significant medical conditions present at the time of ICF signature will be reported as medical history. Clinically significant medical conditions that start or worsen after ICF signature will be reported as AEs. All AE/SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be reported from the time the patient signs the ICF until 30 days after the last dose of stu dy drug or start of new anti -cancer therapy, whichever is earlier ; thereafter , only related SAEs will be reported, with 2 exceptions . 1. Patients who have responded to loncastuximab tesirine and undergo SCT (either autologous or allogeneic) after permanent discontinuation of loncastuximab tesirine treatment without any intervening anti -cancer therapy. These patients will have the following safety information reported until 180 days post -transplant regardless of relationship to loncastuximab tesirine: • Grade ≥3 AEs suggestive of hepatic toxicity, veno- occlusive disease/sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, graft -versus- host disease, infectious complications, prolonged cytopenia(s), and pulmonary toxicity • SAEs • Death"
40,page_40,"ADC Therapeutics Loncastuximab Tesirine ADCT -402-201 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4 Date of Protocol Amendment 4: 09 July 2019 Page 40 2. Patients who receive CAR -T therapy after per manent discontinuation of loncastuximab tesirine treatment will have the following safety information reported until 90 days after receiving CAR- T therapy regardless of relationship to loncastuximab tesirin e: • Grade ≥3 AEs of cytokine release syndrome, encephalopathy, edema or effusion, rash, hepatic toxicity • SAEs • Death Whenever possible, AEs should be reported as a diagnosis rather than individual signs and symptoms. If no diagnosis is available or has been identified, then the primary symptom is reported. In general, the term ‘disease progression ’ should not be used for reporting an AE/SAE. However, AEs/SAEs that are complications of disease progression should be reported. All AEs reported or observed during the study will be recorded on the AE page of t he eCRF. Information to be collected will include event term, date of onset, assessment of severity ( Section 8.2.3), seriousness ( Section 8.2.1), relationship to study drug (Section 8.2.4), action taken with study drug, date of resolution of the event or ongoing (when no resolution by the end of the reporting period), any required treatment or evaluations, and outcome. New SAEs and any recurrent episodes, progression, or complications of the original SAE must be reported to the pharmacovigilance department of the Sponsor or delegate (e.g., contract research o rganization [CRO]) within 24 hours after the time site personnel first learn about the event. Reporting will occur through the electronic data capture ( EDC) system. 8.2.3 Assessment of Severity AEs will be graded according to CTCAE v4.0. For events not include d in the CTCAE criteria, the severity of the AE is graded on a scale of 1 to 5 as shown in Table 3 . Table 3. Definition of Severity Grades for CTCAE Grade Definition 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropria te instrumental activities of daily living (ADL).a 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL.b 4 Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 5 Death related to adverse event. a ADL refer s to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. b Self-care ADL refers to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden. AEs characterized as intermittent do not require documentation of onset and duration of each episode."
41,page_41,"ADC Therapeutics Loncastuximab Tesirine ADCT -402-201 Clinical Protocol Amendment 4 Date of Protocol Amendment 4: 09 July 2019 Page 41 8.2.4 Assessment of Causality The Investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study drug is an important part of safety reporting, but is not a factor in determining whether an AE is reported. An AE will be assessed as related to study drug if there is a reasonable possibility of causal relationship with the use of the study drug. For SAEs, whenever possible, the Investigator should provide a rationale for the causality assessment. 8.2.5 Regulatory Reporting All SAEs considered at least possibly related to the study drug will be reported as Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs), unless they have been defined as expected in the Reference Safety Information section of the IB. SUSARs will be reported to competent authorities and independent ethics committee ( IEC) in ac cordance with current legislation. 8.2.6 Pregnancy Any pregnancy in a participant or partner that occurs during the study must be reported using the Pregnancy Report Form. Pregnancy must be reported within 24 hours after the site personnel first learn of the pregnancy. The pregnancy itself is not considered an AE. However, the pregnancy must be followed to determine outcome (including spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality) and status of mother and child, even if the patient discontinued from the study. Abortions (elective or spontaneous) occurring from the time the patient signs the ICF until 90 days after the last dose of study drug must be reported as an SAE. Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy that is brought to the Investigator’s attention after the patient has completed the study and considered by the Investigator as possibly related to the study drug must be promptly reported in the same manner. Once pregnancy is confirmed in a study participant, study drug will be discontinued, see Section 8.3.6 for additional information. 8.2.7 Overdose An overdose of the study drug will be considered an AE if the dose administered to the patient exceeds the maximum dose described in the protocol by 15% or more. If such an overdose occurs during the study, with or without any signs or symptoms, it must be reported to the Sponsor using the SAE Report Form within 24 hours after the time site personnel first learn about the event . 8.3 Safety Assessments Safety will be assessed based on the procedures in the subsection below. AEs/SAEs collection and reporting is described in Sectio n 8.2.2. Unless otherwise specified, all safety assessments on dosing days will be done prior to study drug administration."

Additional measurements will be performed if clinically indicated. Patient s should monitor their weight at home to mitigate the risks for edema/effusions. Refer to Section 6.6.2 for further details. 8.3.4 Vital Signs Vital signs include the measurements of arterial blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature and will be performed according to the institutional standards. For Day 1 of each cycle, vital signs are to be measured before the start of the loncastuximab tesirine infusion and at the end of infusion. 8.3.5 Laboratory Tests Sample s will be collected at the time points specified as per SoE (Table 1 ). Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory test results will be recorded a s AEs or SAEs . Hematology : white blood cells (WBC) with 5 -part differential (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes), platelet count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Chemistry: ALT, AST, GGT, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), amylase, lipase, total bilirubin (conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin only when total bilirubin is abnormal), sodium, potassium, chloride, phosphate, calcium, magnesium, blood urea nitrogen or urea, carbon dioxide/bicarbonate, creatinine, creatine phosphokinase, total protein, albumin, glucose, and lactate dehydrogenase. Coagulation: partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and International Normalized Ratio (INR). Urinalysis : pH, specific gravity, protein, WBC , red blood cell (RBC) , ketones, glucose, and bilirubin. Urinalysis may be performed by dipstick. Abnormal findings will be followed up with a microscopic evaluation and/or additional assessments as clinically indicated. A microscopic evaluation consists at a minimum of WBC and RBC quantitation per high power field, as well as semi -quantitative assessment of other cells and substances, if present, such as epithelial cells, bacteria , and crystals (“few,” “moderate,” “many”). Other evaluations depending on microscopic findings may be added."

Approximately 6 mL of whole blood will be collected as per Table 1 and Table 5 . Blood should be drawn from a vein away from the one used for study drug infusion. For patients who test positive for ADAs , an additional ADA sample will be requested for testing every 12 we eks following the EOT visit until the ADA titer falls to a background level. ADA samples must be stored at -70°C. Please refer to the laboratory manual for detail ed instructions regarding specimen handling and shipment."

The EQ -5D-5L consists of two parts: • The descriptive system: QoL is classified according to five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each dimension comprises five levels of perceived problems (e.g., none, slight, moderate, severe, extreme). • The visual analog scale (VAS): patients are asked to indicate their health state today on a VAS with the endpoints labeled ‘the best health you can imagine’ (score 100) and ‘the worst health you can imagine’ (score 0). Patients are asked to mark an “X” on the VAS to indicate their own health and then to report the score in a text box. If there is a discrepancy between where the patient has placed the X and the number he/she has written in the box, the number in the box is to be entered in the CRF together with a comment indicating the discrepancy. 8.5.2 Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Lymphoma (FACT -Lym) FACT -Lym is a lymphoma -specific subscale for the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) questionnaire (Hlubocky FJ et al, 2013). It consists of 15 specific items that are used together with the core 27 -item questionnaire FACT -G. The patient is asked to respond to each item with a score of 0 –4, where 0 = not at all, 1 = a little bit, 2 = somewhat, 3 = quite a bit, and 4 = very much. A higher score indicates a worse level of QoL."
47,page_47,"ADC Therapeutics Loncastuximab Tesirine ADCT -402-201 Clinical Protocol Amend ment 4 Date of Protocol Amendment 4: 09 July 2019 Page 47 9 Statistic al Considerations Full details of th e analysis plan, including a more technical and detailed elaboration of the statistical analyses, will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 9.1 Sample Size Calculation Patients with DLBCL who have failed second line therapy have a very poor prognosis, with response to second -line salvage therapy ranging from 14- 26%, with a median survival of 6.1 months ( Seshadri et al., 2008; Crump et al., 2017). A treatment with a response rate of 20% would be a clinically meaningful option for this patient population. The primary hypothesis is that the ORR based on central review for patients treated with loncastuximab tesirine is significantly greater than 20% (i.e., H0: p ≤ 0.2 vs. Ha: p >0.2). This hypothesis will be tested at type I error of 0.05 (two sided). Using nQuery exact test for single proportion, a sample size of 140 patients has >99% power to achieve a 1 -sided significance level of 0.025 (2- sided significance level of 0.05). This sample size will provide adequate precision for observed ORR in the expected range. A 2-stage design will be used, with an interim analysis for futility on the first 52 patients. If ≥10 patients respond, the study will proceed to complete full enrollment. Enrollment will continue during the interim analysis; however, further enrollment will be halted if futility is confirmed to minimize exposure of patients in the study. With the null hypothesis that the true response rate is 0.2, and the alternative hypothesi s that the true response rate is significantly greater than 20% , (40% is used for calculation), the design controls the type I error rate at 0.025 and yields a power of >99%. 9.2 Analysis Populations • All Treated Population: All patients who receive at least 1 dose of loncastuximab tesirine . This population will be used in the primary analyses of efficacy and safety . • Per-Protocol Population: All patients in the all -treated population without major protocol deviations, which will be further described in detail in the SAP . • PK Population: All patients in the per -protocol population with at least 1 pre- ( C1D1 ) and 1 post-dose valid assessment . • Pharmacodynamics Population: All patients in the per -protocol population with at least 1 valid pharmacodynamics / 9.3 Interim Analysis for Futility A single interim analysis is planned using Simo n’s 2-stage procedure. The purpose of this interim analysis is solely to determine if there is a sufficient ORR observed early in the study to warrant continuing study enrollment to completion. The interim analysis constitutes a futility analysis; it will not be used to stop the trial early for positive efficacy. In the first s tage of the study, an interim analysis will be performed a t the time when the 52nd patient has two tumor assessment s (approximately 12 weeks after start of study drug). Enrollment will continue during the interim analysis. If ≥10 patients respond, the study will proceed to the second stage. If < 10 patients respond, study enrollment will be halted."
48,page_48,"ADC Therapeutics Loncastuximab Tesirine ADCT -402-201 Clinical Protocol Amend ment 4 Date of Protocol Amendment 4: 09 July 2019 Page 48 Patients already enrolled may continue treatment for up to 1 year or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other discontinuation criteria ( Section 7), whichever occurs first. Additionally, patients benefitting clinically at 1 year may continue treatment after a case by case review with the Sponsor. 9.4 Final A nalysis For p rimary and key secondary endpoints analyses, a database snapshot will be taken when all patients have a minimum of 6 months follow up after initial documented response . All efficacy , safety , and PK endpoints will be analyzed and reported in the clinical study report ( CSR). Results of the population PK analysis will be reported separately. The exact binomial test will be used in the final analyses for the primary endpoint because of the practical consideration that accrual cannot be limited to exactly 140 patients and because patients included in the interim analysis as non -responding may be included in the final analysis as responding if they experience a late response. Follow- up analyses will be performed when all the patients complete the study per protocol. The results will be reported in a CSR addendum. 9.5 Demographics and Baseline C haracteristics The analyses include: • Demographic information such as age, gender, ethnicity, and race (to the extent allowed by local regulations). • Cancer medical history, which includes a complete history of all surgeries and significant diagnoses, and all cancer treatment, including surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, e tc. • Any other relevant medical history. 9.6 Efficacy Analyses Primary efficacy analyses will be based on response as determined by central review . Response reported by investigators will be used for sensitivity analyses. 9.6.1 Overall Response Rate The ORR will be defined as the proportion of patients with a BOR of CR or PR. The overall response category will be derived based on response assessment performed on or before the start of subsequent anti -cancer therapy. For the primary ORR analysis in the a ll treated population, patients with a CR or PR will be counted as successes and all other patients (including those with missing response information) will be counted as failures. The percentage of ORR with its 95% confidence interval (CI) will be presented. In contrast to CR, PR, or PD, a BOR of SD can only be made after the patient is on-study for a minimum of 35 days after the first dose of study drug. A ny tumor assessment indicating SD before this time period will be considered as a non- evaluable for BOR if no assessment after this time period is available ."

The date of disease progression will be defined as the earliest date of disease progression based on central review . For patients who have not progressed or died at the time of the analysis, censoring will be performed using the date of the last valid disease assessment. The data will be analyzed by the Kaplan -Meier method. The median duration of response and 95% CI will be presented. DOR will be analyzed by response subgroup (CR, PR). Further details will be outlined in the SAP. 9.6.3 Complete Response Rate Complete Response Rate (CRR) will be defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall response of CR. The percentage of CRR with its 95% CI will be presented. 9.6.4 Relapse -free Survival RFS will be defined among CR patients as the time from the earliest date of first complete response until the first date of either disease relapse or death due to any cause. The date of disease progression will be defined as the earliest date of disease progression based on central review. For patients who have not progressed or died at the time of the analysis, censoring will be performed using the date of the last valid disease assessment. The data will be analyzed by the Kaplan -Meier method. The median duration of response and 95% CI will be presented. Further details will be outlined in the SAP. 9.6.5 Progression- Free Survival PFS will be defined among all treated patients as the time from first dose of study drug until the first date of either disease progression or death due to any cause. The date of disease progression will be defined as the earliest date of disease progression based on central review . For patients whose disease has not progressed at the time of the analysis, censoring will be performed using the date of the last valid di sease assessment. The data will be analyzed by the Kaplan -Meier method. The median PFS time and 95% CI will be presented. Further details will be outlined in the SAP. 9.6.6 Overall Survival Median OS will be defined as the time from the beginning of study drug treatment until death due to any cause. For patients who have not died at the time of the analysis, censoring will be performed using the date the patient was last known to be alive. The data will be analyzed by the Kaplan -Meier method. The median OS and 95% CI will be presented. Further details will be outlined in the SAP."

A TEAE is defined as an AE that occurs or worsens in the period extending from the first dose of study drug to 30 days after the last dose of study drug or start of new anti- cancer therapy, whichever is earlier . TEAEs will be summarized. Summary tables will be presented to show the number of patients reporting TEAE s by severity grade and corresponding percentages. A patient who reports multiple TEAE s within the same Preferred Term (or System Organ Class) is counted only once for that Preferred Term (or System Organ Class) using th e worst severity grade. Separate summaries will be prepared for TEAEs classified as severe or life- threatening (Grade 3 or higher); study drug- related AEs; AEs leading to treatment interruption, modification, or discontinuation; serious AEs; and death. Dose interruptions, reductions, and relative dose intensity will also be summarized. 9.7.2 Clinical Laboratory Results Clinical hematology, coagulation panel, biochemistry, and urinalysis data will be summarized at each scheduled assessment. Shifts for clinical laboratory results that can be gr aded according to CTCAE v4.0 (or more recent ) will be summarized by CTCAE grade. Shifts for other numeric laboratory results will be by high/normal/low flag. Shifts for all other laboratory results will be by normal/abnormal flag. Summaries by visit will include data from scheduled assessments, and all data will be reported according to the nominal visit date for which it was recorded. Unscheduled data will be included in “worst -case post -Baseline” summaries, which will capture a worst case across all scheduled and unscheduled visits after the first dose of study drug.

PK parameters will be determined for all PK -evaluable patients using a non-compartmental method with Phoenix WinNonlin (Ce rtara USA, Inc., Princeton, NJ, US) or other a ppropriate software. Supplemental population PK a nalyse s will be undertaken and reported separately to characterize the PK parameters for the typical patient and to identify covariate factors which influence drug disposition. Demographic data for the PK population will be sum marized. Potential correlations of PK parameters to baseline characteristics and safety observations will be assessed but may be reported separately . In addition, the influence of loncastuximab tesirine PBD-conjugated antibody and unconjugated warhead SG3199 concentrations on the QTc interval will be assessed but reported separately. 9.9 Immunogenicity Analyses A tiered immunogenicity strategy ( Figure 2) will be undertaken to evaluate ADAs by screening and confirmatory assays with titer evaluation, followed by characterization and evaluation of neutralizing capacity as needed.

However, in trials involving PET where de -escalation is investigated, it may be preferable to consider a score of 3 as inadequate response (to avoid undertreatment). Measured dominant lesions: Up to six of the largest dominant nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal lesions selected to be clearly measurable in two diameters. Nodes should preferably be from disparate regions of the body and should include, where applicable, mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas. Non-nodal lesions include those in solid organs (e.g., liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs), GI involvement, cutaneous lesions, or those noted on palpation. Nonmeasured lesions: Any disease not selected as measured, dominant disease and truly assessable disease should be considered not measured. These sites include any nodes, nodal masses, and extranodal sites not selected as dominant or measurable or that do not meet the requirements for measurability but are still considered abnormal, as well as truly assessable disease, which is any site of suspected dise ase that would be difficult to follow quantitatively with"

In Waldeyer’s ring or in extranodal sites (e.g., GI tract, liver, bone marrow), FDG uptake may be greater than in the mediastinum with complete metabolic response, but should be no higher than surrounding normal physiologic uptake (e.g., with marrow activation as a result of chemotherapy or myeloid growth factors). ** PET 5PS: 1, no uptake above background; 2, uptake ≤ mediastinum; 3, uptake > mediastinum but ≤ liver; 4, uptake moderately > liver; 5, uptake markedly higher than liver and/or new lesions; X, new areas of uptake unl ikely to be related to lymphoma.
