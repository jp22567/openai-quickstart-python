Samples will be drawn by nurses rather than phlebotomists and stored in McLendon laboratory. This modification in no way increases risk to subjec ts, but only reflects the actual workflow on the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit. Scientific changes (1) Throughout the protocol, Medical/Surgical Tracking Form is omitted, as it was overly inclusive and not necessary to accomplish the study’s aims. In its place , a Delirium Risk Factor Form has been added, which will document previous history of delirium, alcohol and substance use, and neurological conditions (stroke, traumatic brain injury, seizures, abnormal brain imaging findings) from chart abstraction. (2) Throu ghout the protocol, revised baseline labs to no longer include folate and vitamin B12. These are also not necessary to accomplish the study’s aims and not typically drawn on patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). (3) Throughout th e protocol, revised schedule of baseline labs (CBC, CMP, Mg, Phos) to within 2 days of transplant, rather than specifically on post -transplant day 1. These labs are routinely drawn on Mondays and Thursdays, so this modification prevents additional blood d raws, thereby improving nursing workflow and minimizing patient burden. (4) Class of concurrent CNS active medications will continue to be documented, but throughout the protocol revised to indicate that details regarding dose, route, frequency, and indication will no longer be captured, as this data will not be necessary to accomplish the study’s aims."

This modification is reflected in Appendix E and does not necessitate modification in other areas of the protocol. (6) Section 5.2. Language a dded to explicitly reflect that the PI, primary medical providers, or other emergency personnel may request unblinding of a subject’s randomized treatment from the IDS pharmacy. Therapy changes (1) Throughout the protocol, the preparation of our intervention was changed from Thiamine 200 mg in a 2 mL syringe to Thiamine 200 mg diluted in 100 mL 0.9% normal saline. Our placebo was changed from 2 mL of 0.9% normal saline to 100 mL 0.9% normal saline to maintain blinding. The intervention will be a dministered over 30 minutes, rather than the four minutes described in the previous version of this protocol. No changes were made to strength, route (intravenous), frequency (TID), or duration (seven days). This modification was made to improve nursing workflow, as it is not practical for them to administer the syringe by hand at 50 mg/min as outlined in the previous version of the protocol.

16,page_16,"LCCC XXXX CONFIDENTIAL PI: Zev Nakamura UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA April 2017 4 1.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 1.1 Study Synopsis This is a randomized double -blind controlled trial in participants undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) to determine if high dose intravenous ( IV) thiamine can prevent delirium and minimize the deleterious impact of delirium on health -related quality of life ( HRQOL ), functional status , and other neuropsychiatric outcomes. We will recruit 60 evaluable patients scheduled for allogeneic HSCT at UNC, randomize them to treatment with high dose IV thiamine (n = 30) versus placebo (n = 30) , and systematically evaluate all participants for de lirium and related comorbidities. We will use the Delirium Rating Scale (DRS) to measure the severity and duration of delirium immediately prior to transplant and after HSCT until 30 days post-transplant or discharge. We will obtain thiamine levels and other laboratory parameters associated with delirium the day after transplant, and continue to monitor thiamine levels weekly thereafter. We will also monitor HRQOL (FACT -BMT), functional status (ECOG -PS), depression (PROMIS -D), post -traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS - 14), and cognitive function (MOCA) prior to transplant and at one, three, and six months after transplant to elucidate the persistent impact of delirium in this popu lation and the potential for thiamine to mi tigate these negative outcomes. 1.2 Disease Background Delirium is a highly prevalent and potentially preventable neuropsychiatric condition with major health consequences in cancer patients. Delirium is seen in 25 – 40% of cancer patients,1,2 and in those with late -stage and terminal cancers the prevalence may be as high as 85%.3 Delirium is associated with increased length of stay,4 elevated mortality,5 impaired activities of daily living,6 and has profound immediate and long -term impact on mental health with studies demonstrating persistent symptoms of depression,7 post-traumatic stress,8 and impaired cognition.9 Cancer patients undergoing HSCT are at even higher risk given that they typically present with advanced disease and have already received one or more courses of systemic chemotherapy. In the only two studies to evaluate the epidemiology of delirium in HSCT patients, delirium was described in at least 40%, and possibly as many as 73%, of patients during post -transplant hospitalization.10,11 Delirium in HSCT patients confers worse HRQOL, more severe distress, poor cognitive outcomes, and a 14 -fold greater mortality rate.9,11 In sum, delirium in cancer patients, particularly those receiving HSCT, is extremely common, has major medical and neuropsychiatric consequences that persist even after the delirium has resolved, and, therefore, demands efforts to prevent its occurrence. Thiamine deficiency is an underappreciated cause of delirium. Wernicke’s encephalop athy (WE) is a condition, most commonly but not exclusively associated with alcoholism, in which thiamine deficiency leads to a triad of"
17,page_17,"LCCC XXXX CONFIDENTIAL PI: Zev Nakamura UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA April 2017 5 clinical signs (ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and mental status changes) . Because its diagnosis requires a high index of su spicion and reliance on complex clinical findings, more than 80% of cases of the closely related Wernicke -Korsakoff Syndrome (WKS) go undiagnosed during patients’ lifetimes.12-14 Of note, WKS refers to the spectrum of neuropsychiatric conditions that res ult from thiamine deficiency, which includes WE as well as Korsakoff’s syndrome , an irreversible dementia with marked anterograde amnesia. Only in the past 20 years have clinicians and researchers become aware of the potential for thiamine deficiency to impact mental status and lead to delirium without the other physical signs of WE.15 Accordingly, the precise incidence of delirium due to thiamine deficiency is not known. However, this connection, specifically in cancer patients, is rapidly evolving. A recent retrospective study, for example, reported that thiamine deficiency occurred in 55% of cancer patients, 80% of whom demonstrated some mental status abnormality.16 HSCT patients are particularly vulnerable to thiamine deficiency. In the only study to systematically monitor thiamine levels in cancer patients undergoing HSCT, 100% of patients developed thiamine deficiency during post -transplant hospitalization.17 There are several pathways by which HSCT patients become thiamine deficient. First, less thiamine is absorbed from the diet due to anorexia and vomiting common with many cancers and their treatments.18 Second, there is increased metabolism of thiamine secondary to rapid cell turnover inherent in hematologic malignancies and complications after transplant, such as graft versus host disease (GvHD) and infection. Finally, chemotherapies and calcineurin inhibitors, commonly administered during hospitalization for HSCT, impair conversion of thiamine to its biologically active form.18,19 There is insufficient data regarding relative incidences of thiamine deficiency or delirium in allogeneic vs. autologous transplants. However, allogeneic transplant recipients do display increased mortality and morbidity, including outcomes such as infection and GvHD , known to increase risk of thiamine deficiency , potentially making them an even greater risk group.11,20,21 Therefore, while thiamine deficiency is unlikely to be the sole source of delirium in HSCT patients, it appears to be a universal and treatable one. High dose IV thiamine is a promising intervention for delirium in cancer patients undergoing HSCT. Curr ently, there is no established way to treat or prevent delirium in this patient population. Standard approaches for delirium management, including use of antipsychotics, are limited by potentially life - threatening side effects in the medically ill. Treat ment of suspected thiamine - related mental status changes with high dose IV thiamine, defined as at least 200 mg three times daily , has preliminary evidence for improving a variety of cognitive symptoms.22-25 Unfortunately, delirium due to thiamine deficie ncy is often missed entirely or diagnosed late in the course of delirium, leading to treatment delays, after patients have been put at risk for immediate and long -term consequences of delirium. This highlights the need for prophylaxis strategies, but surprising ly, the use of high dose IV thiamine has never been studied for the"
18,page_18,"LCCC XXXX CONFIDENTIAL PI: Zev Nakamura UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA April 2017 6 prevention of delirium in any condition, including in this highly vulnerable HSCT population. 1.3 Current Standard of Care Currently, there is no standard of care for the prevention or t reatment of delirium in HSCT patients. There is also no consensus regarding dose for treatment or prophylaxis of delirium specifically due to thiamine d eficiency , but it is generally dosed at ≥ 50 mg IV or intramuscularly ( IM) daily .26 An unpublished electronic medical record review from our group , investigating thiamine prescribing practices at UNC Hospitals between 4/4/2014 and 11/1/2015, described over 5,000 prescriptions for thiamine. Of these, 29% (N = 1531) were given IV with 41% (N = 633) of IV pr escriptions for doses 200 mg or greater . This same study described 432 subjects who had delirium and receive d IV thiamine . Only 15 subjects with deli rium received at least 200 mg IV three times daily (tid). 1.4 High Dose Intravenous Thiamine For this trial we have chosen to study the effects of high dose IV thiamine. Parenteral t hiamine administration has been well studied in large population samples and shown to be safe with the most common adverse effects being immediate, transient burning at the in jection site (1.02%) and pruritis (<0.1%) .27- 29 Other side effects are sufficiently rare that rates of occurrence are not available. Thiamine (vitamin B1) is a water soluble vitamin. It is an important cofactor in the Kreb’s Cycle and Pentose Phosphate Pathway, thus critical for metabolism of lipids, glucose, amino acids, and neurotransmitters. It is absorbed by an energy - dependent active transport system in the gut, which limits absorption such that no more than 4.5 mg thiamine is absorbed for oral do ses 50 mg or greater .28 It reaches the brain across the blood brain barrier through facilitated diffusion, active transport across the choroid plexus, and simple diffusion mechanisms. Thiamine has FDA indications for Wernicke’s encephalopathy and the related Wernicke -Korsakoff syndrome, thiamine defi ciency, administration of dextrose - containing fluids , berberi, and peripheral neuritis in pregnancy.30 It is metabolized in the liver (exact mechanism not known) and excreted in the kidney. There have not been any studies investigating its use specifically in HSCT patients. The longstanding recommendation for treatment of WE in the United States is 100 mg IV daily. This is based on estimates from experts , developed over 50 years ago, of what might consti tute high doses. There have been no clinical studies validating the efficacy of this dosing strategy.22,23,31 Though the most recent Cochrane review on the subject stated that there was insufficient evidence regarding dose, frequency, route, or duration o f thiamine for treatment or prophylax is of WE and related syndromes,26 there are currently two sets of guidelines recommending at least 200 mg IV tid from the European Federation of Neurologic Society ( EFNS ) and Royal College of Physicians ( RCP ).28,32 This"
19,page_19,"LCCC XXXX CONFIDENTIAL PI: Zev Nakamura UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA April 2017 7 dosing strategy ha s demonstrated efficacy in several case reports.22-25 The only existing randomized controlled trial investigating the dose response of thiamine on improving mental status abnormalities , revealed that subjects treated with the highest dose studied, 200 mg IM, performed best on one measure of working memory.33 1.5 Rationale for Clinical Study Delirium occurs in at least 40%, and up to 73%, of patients undergoing HSCT.10,11 Delirium is associated with longer length of stay,4 increased mortality,5 impaired activities of daily living,6 and can have profound immediate and long -term effects on men tal health with studies demonstrating lasting symptoms of depression,7 post-traumatic stress,8 and impaired cognition.9 Thiamine deficiency is an underappreciated cause of delirium. Thiamine deficiency has been reported in 100% of patients undergoing H SCT.17 The co - occurrence of delirium and thiamine deficiency in HSCT is not known, but in cancer patients more broadly thiamine deficiency occurred in 55% of patients , 80% of whom demonstrated some mental status abnormality.16 There are not sufficient da ta to support a specific dosing strategy for thiamine repletion to target delirium due to thiamine deficiency in any patient population ,26 and no published studies investigating treatment or prophylaxis of delirium due to thiamine deficiency in HSCT patien ts. In this double -blind, randomized controlled trial, we examine the use of high dose IV thiamine to prevent occurrence and decrease severity and duration of delirium. Our study design also allows for additional novel data on the temporal relationship b etween thiamine deficiency and delirium in HSCT patients . 2.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary Objective s 2.1.1 To compare delirium incidence between recipients of high dose IV thiamine and placebo during hospitalization for allogeneic HSCT. 2.2 Secondary Objectives 2.2.1 To compare delirium severity between recipients of high dose IV thiamine and placebo during hos pitalization for allogeneic HSCT. 2.2.2 To compare delirium duration between recipients of high dose IV thiamine and placebo during hospitalization for allogeneic HSCT. 2.2.3 To determine if thiamine status is predictive of subsequent delirium onset."

Patients removed from study treatment for unaccep table AEs will be followed for resolution or stabilization of the adverse event(s). All patients (including those withdrawn for AEs) will be followed after removal from study treatment as stipulated in the protocol. 5.8 Study Withdrawal Patients will be removed from protocol therapy and the PI notified when any of the criteria listed in section 5. 6 apply. The reason for discontinuation of the protocol therapy will be documented on the eCRF. If a patient decides to withdraw from the study (and not just from protocol therapy) an effort will be made to complete and report study assessments as thoroughly as possible . At the time of withdrawal, Drs. Nakamura or Rosenstein will attempt to establish as completely as possi ble the reason for the study withdrawal. • The patient will be asked if they are willing to allow for the abstraction of relevant information from their medical r ecord in order to meet the long - term follow up objectives outlined in the protocol. • A complete final evaluation at the time of the patient’s study with drawal will be obtained with an explanation of why the patient is withdrawing from the study. • If they are unwilling to come in for a final visit, then we will attempt to complete all assessments over the phone , through video conferencing, online, by emai l, or by mail that can be completed in this manner • If the patient does not return fo r an end of study follow -up assessment, this will be documented in the eCRF. • If the reason for removal of a patient from the study is an adverse event, the principal specific event will be recorded on the eCRF."

A cut -off score of > 12 has been suggested to distinguish patients with delirium from patien ts with other neuropsychiatric disorders.34,35 Each assessment will require up to 10 minutes of the subject’s time. 5.9.2 Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT -BMT) The FACT -BMT is a 47 -item self -administered assessment w hich has been well validated in the literature and permits the measurement of HRQOL in bone marrow transplant patients.36 It asks individuals to rate questions related to physical, social/family, emotional, and functional well -being on a 5 -point Likert Scale (0, not at all to 4, very much). All participants who are enrolled in the trial will be evaluated pre -transplant and will have repeat assessment at one, three, and six month follow -up visits after transplant. If the subject exhibits difficulty in completing the assessment due to its length, the CRA will help the subject complete it by reading items and answer choices aloud. The FACT -BMT will take no greater than 15 minutes to complete. 5.9.3 Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System – Depression (PROMIS -D) The National Institute of Health’s Patient -Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) contains a depression bank.37 We will use the PROMIS Depression 8a short form. Scores for all PROMIS measures are reported on the T -score metric in which the mean=50 and standard deviation (SD) = 10 are centered on the general population means. Higher scores represent greater degrees of mood symptoms. All participants who are enrolled in the trial will complete the self -administered assessment pre -transplant and will have repeat assessment at one, three, and six mo nth follow -up visits after transplant. The PROMIS -D will take no greater than 5 minutes to complete. 5.9.4 Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome Scale 14 (PTSS -14) The PTSS -14 is a 14 -item self -administered assessment which has been well validated in the litera ture and permits the measurement of post -traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms.38 It has been used in a variety of populations, including assessment following a period of delirium.39 Questions are on a 7 -point Likert -type Scale (1, never to 7, always ) resulting in a total score between 14 and 98. Higher scores represent a more likely diagnosis of PTSD. All participants who are enrolled in the trial will be evaluated pre-transplant and will have repeat assessment at one, three, and six month follow -up visits after transplant. The PTSS -14 will take no greater than 10 minutes to complete."
25,page_25,"LCCC XXXX CONFIDENTIAL PI: Zev Nakamura UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA April 2017 13 5.9.5 Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) The MOCA is a clinician administered tool which has been well validated in the literature, studied in a wide variety of pa tient populations, and permits assessment of cognitive impairment. It is measured on a 30 -point scale with lower scores indicating greater impairment. Scores ≤ 25 are considered clinically significant. All participants who are enrolled in the trial will be evaluated at baseline and will have repeat assessment at one, three, and six month follow -up visits after transplant. The MOCA will take no greater than 10 minutes to complete. 5.9.6 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG - PS) The ECOG performance scale is one of the most widely used measures of functional status.40 It has high reliability and validity and is frequently used to estimate prognosis and treatment eligibility in oncology clinical trials.41 ECOG performance status is scored on a 6 -point scale with higher scores representing greater physical restriction due to illness. The ECOG -PS will take no greater than 2 minutes to complete. 6.0 DRUG INFORMATION 6.1 Thiamine Description and Management 6.1.1 Mechanism of Action Thiamine combines with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to form thiamine pyrophosphate, also known as cocarboxylase, a coenzyme. Its role in carbohydrate metabolism is the decarboxylation of pyruvic acid in the blood and α-ketoacids to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. 6.1.2 Indications Thiamine hydrochloride injection is indicated for the treatment of Wernicke’s encephalopathy, Wernicke -Korsakoff sy ndrome, thiamine deficiency, beriberi (wet or dry) , peripheral neuritis in pregnancy, and with dextrose -contai ning IV fluids . 6.1.3 How Supplied The drug will be obtained from commercial supply through UNC Pharmacy and UNC Investigational Drug Service (IDS) .

Prior to transplant, th e clinical research assistant (CRA) will rev iew the trial with the subject, obtain informed consent, and the subject will complete self -report assessments for depression ( PROMIS - D), post -traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS -14), and HRQOL (FACT -BMT) , as well as clinician -rated assessment s of cognition (MOCA) , functional status (ECOG -PS), and for delirium (DRS) . See Appendices A – F. The CRA or investigators will al so conduct a review of electronic medical records to obtain baseline information regarding delirium risk factors , the subject’s cancer and cancer treatment, and demographic information. 7.3 Randomization If the patient meets all inclusion/exclusion criteria, provides informed consent, and is not delirious (DRS ≤12), t he subject s will then be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention or control arms in a double -blind fashion such that the investigators, biostatistician, CRA (s), nursing staff, and subjects will not know which agent is being administered. The statistician of record will design a block randomization scheme, stratified by age (<65 or ≥65) and baseline cognitive function (MOCA >25 or ≤25) , both well -known risk factor s for delirium. This information will be provided to UNC Investigational Drug Services, who will manage the actual assignment of subjects to each arm using the randomization list designed by the statistician. 7.4 Post-Transplant Days 1 – 30 Assessments Withi n two days of transplant, the subject will have a CBC, CMP, Mg level, Phos level, and Thiamine level drawn. The CRA (s) or investigators will perform the delirium assessment (DRS), and a brief history will be obtained to assess for any toxicity from therap y. Over the course of 30 days following transplant (or discharge, whichever comes first), the subject will continue to have weekly thiamine levels drawn (at day s 8, 15, 22, and 2 9 +/- one day ). The CRA (s) or investigators will continue to assess for delirium, using the DRS, three times weekly. If a subject is determined to"

The DRS assessments will not be performed if a patient becomes unevaluable due to an acute medical concern (e.g. intubation, sedation, etc.) . The CRA (s) or investigators will continue to assess for any toxicity from therapy. 7.5 Long -term Follow -Up Assessments At on e, three, and six months post -transplant the CRA (s) or investigators will meet with subjects to complete self -report assessments for depression ( PROMIS - D), post -traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS -14), and HRQOL (FACT -BMT), as well as clinician -rated assessmen ts of cognition (MOCA) and functional status (ECOG -PS). At the time of each follow -up, delirium assessments (DRS) will also be performed in participants who became delirious during the inpatient phase . Subjects will receive reminders regarding these long -term assessments via subjects’ preferred method of contact. Long-term assessments will occur at one month (+/ - two weeks), three months (+/ - four weeks), and six months (+/ - two month s). The specified window at each of these follow -up time points will allow for assessments to coincide with BMT clinic visits . If a face to face assessment is not feasible, attempts will be made to perform assessments over the phone , through video conferen cing, online, by email, or by mail. When assessments cannot be completed, this will be noted in the eCRF. 7.6 Concurrent CNS Active Medications All conc urren t CNS active medication s, including antidepressants, a nxiolytics, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, and antihistamines will b e documented at Baseline/Screening and throughout the study as summarized in the Time and Events Table in Section 7.1. 7.7 Demographics Demographic information (date of birth, ge nder, race) will be recorded by the CRA from review of me dical records at baseline . 7.8 Delirium Risk Factors Relevant risk factors for delirium, including previous history of delirium, alcohol and substance use, and neurological conditions (stroke, traumatic brain injury, seizures, abnormal findings on imaging) will be abstracted from medical records at baseline . 7.9 Handling of Biospecimens Collected for Correlative Research Biospecimens for this study will be collected by a registered nurse and stored in the McLendon laboratories .

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product. Hospitalization for elective surgery or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of an AE (e.g., surgical insertion of central line) need not be considered AEs and should not be recorded as an AE. Development or worse ning of delirium should not be recorded as an AE, unless it is attributable by the investigator to the study therapy. 8.1.2 Suspected Adverse Reaction (SAR) A suspected adverse reaction (SAR) is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug is the cause. Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any advers e event caused by a drug. Causality assessment to a study drug is a medical judgment made in consideration of the following factors: temporal relationship of the AE to study drug exposure, known mechanism of action or side effect profile of study treatm ent, other recent or concomitant drug exposures, normal clinical course of the disease under investigation, and any other underlying or concurrent medical conditions . Other factors to consider in considering drug as the cause of the AE: • Single occurrence of an uncommon event known to be strongly associated with drug exposure (e.g., angioedema, hepatic injury, Stevens -Johnson Syndrome) • One or more occurrences of an event not commonly associated with drug exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population (e .g., tendon rupture) ; often more than once occurrence from one or multiple studies would be needed before the sponsor could determine that there is reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event."
31,page_31,"LCCC XXXX CONFIDENTIAL PI: Zev Nakamura UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA April 2017 19 • An aggregate analysis of specific events observed i n a clinical trial that indicates the events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or historical control group 8.1.3 Unexpected AE or SAR An AE or SAR is considered unexpected if the specificity or severity of it is not consisten t with the applicable product information (e.g., package insert/summary of product characteristics for an approved product). Unexpected also refers to AEs or SARs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the p harmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 8.1.4 Serious AE or SAR An AE or SAR is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes : • Death; • Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred); • Requires inpatient hospitalization (>24 hours) or prolongation of existing hospitalization;* • Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect; • Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions; • Important medical events that may not result in death, be life - threatening, or require hospitaliza tion may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition. Fo r reporting purposes, also consider the occurrences of pregnancy as an event which must be reported as an important medical event. *Hospitalization for anticipated or protocol specified procedures such as administration of chemotherapy, central line inser tion, metastasis interventional therapy, resection of primary tumor, or elective surgery, will not be considered serious adverse events. Pregnancy that occurs during the study must also be reported as an SAE. 8.2 Document ation of non-serious AEs or SARs For non -serious A Es or SARs, documentation must begin from day 1 of study treatment and continue through the 30 day follow -up period after treatment is discontinued."

For any experience or condition that meets the defi nition of a serious adverse event (SAE), recording of the event will begin after signing of the informed consent and continue through the 30 day follow -up period after treatment is discontinued. These events will be recorded in the CRF for that patient wi thin 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. If the event is both serious AND unexpected, it will also be recorded on the MedWatch Form 3500A, as per 21 CFR 312.32, and forwarded to the FDA in accordance with 21 CFR 314.80 (for marketed drugs). The UNC I RB will be notified of all SAEs that qualify as an Unanticipated Problem (serious, unexpected, and related) as per the UNC IRB policies. In accordance with these policies, an aggregated list of all SAEs will be submitted to the UNC IRB annually at the time of study renewal. Periodic review, at an interval of every six months to annually, by the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center Data Safety Committee (LCC DSMC), Protocol Review Committee (PRC), and Office of Human Research Ethics (OHRE) Biomedical IRB will provide oversight of the Co - PIs’ continuous monitoring. For each DSMC review, summary information regarding toxicity and accrual patterns will be prepared and submitted by the Co -PIs.

We will recruit 60 evaluable patients scheduled for allogeneic HSCT at UNC, randomize them to treatment with high"
34,page_34,"LCCC XXXX CONFIDENTIAL PI: Zev Nakamura UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA April 2017 22 dose IV thiamine (n = 30) versus placebo (n = 30) , and systematically evaluate all participants for de lirium and related comorbidities. Analysis Populations: The Safety Population will be defined as all subjects who were enrolled and received at least one dose of study medication. Efficacy Evaluable Population will be defined as all subjects who received at least 80% (17/21) of total possible intervention doses and part icipated in at least one delirium assessment weekly . The primary efficacy endpoint is delirium incidence defined as DRS >12 . Secondary endpoints include delirium duration and severity, along with FACT - BMT, PROMIS -D, PTSS -14, ECOG -PS, and MOCA. 9.2 Sample Siz e, Accrual and Duration of Accrual For the primary objective of comparing delirium incidence between groups, a two group chi -squared test with a 0.05 0 one -sided significance level will have 80% power to detect the difference between a usual care proportion of 0.445 and an intervention proportion of 0.155 (odds ratio of 0.2 29) when the evaluable sample size in each group is 30. The anticipated rate of delirium in the control group is based on 43 – 73% incidence of delirium during hospitalization for HSCT reported in the literature. As this is the first study to evaluate the efficacy of thiamine as a prevention strategy for delirium, no data is availabl e to generate an estimate of delirium incidence in the intervention group. However, the odds ratio (OR) hypothesized for this study is in line with other successful delirium prevention trials.42,43 Even if the delirium incidence in the IV thiamine group is not this low, the results of this study will provide effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals to power a future larger study. Our sample will include 60 adult participants. UNC tumor registry records demonstra te that between 2015 and 2016 133 patients were admitted for allogeneic stem cell transplant. We estimate that we will enroll at least 50% of eligible patients, based on recruitment rates described in previous delirium intervention studies,44 allowing us to recruit our target of 60 evaluable participants in approximately two years and complete our study in the proposed three year grant period. 9.3 Data Analysi s Plans To compare delirium incidence, severity, and duration between recipients of high dose IV thiamine and placebo during hospitalization for HSCT . The primary outcome measure is delirium incidence, defined as: DRS > 12 . Secondary outcomes are differences in delirium duration (in days) and delirium severity, in which higher DRS scores suggest more severe delirium. A two group chi -squared test will be used to compare rates of delirium in the intervention and control group. Maximum severity score will be analy zed using two group t -tests, and time to delirium will be compared between groups using the Kaplan -Meier"
35,page_35,"LCCC XXXX CONFIDENTIAL PI: Zev Nakamura UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA April 2017 23 method. For those with delirium, two group t -tests will compare the duration of delirium between intervention groups ; Kaplan -Meier methods may also be considered for time to delirium resolution . To determine if thiamine status is predictive of future delirium onset. We will examine the relationship between thiamine levels at the end of the seven day administration of thiamine and the development of delirium at any point during the thirty days post -transplant or the post-transplant hospitalization , whichever comes first . Patients who develop delirium prior to the end of the thiamine treatment will not be included in th is analysis. We will examine t he sensitivity and specificity of this relationship with ROC curves, and attempt to find a cutoff for thiamine levels that is associated with the development of delirium. To investigate the effects of high dose IV thiamine on long -term health -related quality of life (HRQOL), functional status, depression, post -traumatic stress symptoms, and cognitive functioning in patients hospitalized for HSCT. Scores on FACT -BMT, PROMIS -D, PTSS -14, ECOG -PS and MOCA will be compared between intervention and control groups. We will summarize score s on the FACT -BMT, PROMIS -D, PTSS -14, ECOG -PS, and MOCA between the intervention and control groups at one, three, and six months post -transplant. Longitudinal modeling will be performed to examine differences /changes over time. Safety Analyses: We will tabulate AEs and SAEs, by treatment and placebo, within strata. We will include all AEs which occurred at a rate of more tha n 5% in any treatment . 10.0 STUDY MANAGEMENT 10.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval and Consent It is expected that the IRB will have the proper representation and function in accordance with federally mandated regulations.
