The research objective is to assess the level of BoExp to selected HPHCs representative of ETS in study participants after passive exposure to IQOS use in a restaurant setting where IQOS use, but not cigarette smoking, is allowed. Study Design: This study is a non- interventional observational study designed to assess the impact of environmental tobacco aerosol exposure in Non-Smokers exposed to IQOS in a real -life restaurant setting. Three types of participant with the following characteristics will be enrolled in this study: 1) Non-Smokers; 2) Cigarette Smokers and 3) IQOS Users. IQOS Users will be assigned to either the Passive Exposure or Active Exposure Group (see below). There are three steps in the core study design: • Identification and consent of participants; • Non-Exposure dinner events (‘Non- Exposure Event’) of 4h duration for the individual participant, where no use of any tobacco or nicotine containing product is allowed, designed to establish background measurements in the absence of exposure to IQOS; • Exposure dinner Events (‘Exposure Event’) with 4h of exposure for the individual participants in the Passive Ex posure Group, designed to measure BoExp to selected HPHCs representative of ETS in all participants . A sufficient number of Non- Exposure Events and Exposure Events will be conducted depending on the size of the selected location and to ensure the followin g minimum number of participants in the respective groups: Non-Exposure Event: • Non-Exposed Group (no product use): a minimum of 169 participants comprised of Non-Smokers, IQOS-users not using IQOS or any other tobacco or nicotine- containing product, and cigarette ( CC) smokers not using cigarettes or any other tobacco or nicotine-containing product for the duration of the Non -Exposure event ; Exposure Event: • Passive Exposure Group (no product use): a minimum of 169 participants passively exposed comprised o f Non-Smokers, IQOS-users not using IQOS or any other"

To collect IAQ samples, three mobile sampling set -ups for indoor air pollutants will be used. The set-up consists of 3 aluminum sampling cases with 5 flow -controlled pumps. Each sampling case is equipped with: • 2 х AD-4 traps for Nic otine and 3-EP collection operated at a flow rate of 1.0 L /min for 3h; • 2 x 1 DNPH-silica traps for carbonyl collection (acetaldehyde, acrolein, crotonaldehyde and formaldehyde) operated at a flow rate of 1.2 L/min sequentially for 1h; • 2 glass fiber filters (Cambridge filters) spiked with ascorbic acid for TSNAs (NNN, NNK), operated at a flow rate of 1.0 L/min for 3 h. The position of the sampling cases will be inside the breathing zone as described by ASHRAE.2 Additionally , two small instruments in front of the sampling cases will electronically record the ambient temperature and relative humidity. Furthermore , two portable instruments, used for on-line PM1 -PM10 particle measurements will be used. The equipment are the property of PMI and will be used by a PMI trained scientist acco rding to the ISO accredited method PMI-RRP-WKI-111642 “Dust Trax characterization for real time monitoring of aerosol mass concentration”. A total of 18 tubes per Event will be collected which will be analyzed using validated analytical methods at Analytis ch-biologisches Forschungslabor [ABF] Munich. Statistical Methods: The Compliant Exposure Set will consist of all enrolled participants who have signed the ICF, have participated in either a Non-E xposure Event or an Exposure Event, have provided two urine samples (at minimum, one urine sample prior to the start of the event and one urine sample after a minimum of 2h of individual participation in the Non- Exposure or Exposure Event), and are complia nt with the Event Groups (Non -Exposure vs. Passive Exposure vs. 2 ASHRAE, 2016.

The Active Exposure Set (PP) will consist of all enrolled participants who have signed the ICF, have participated in an Exposure Event, have provided two urine samples ( at minimum, one urine sa mple prior to the start of the E vent and one urine sample after a minimum of 2h after the start of the Active Exposure), and were in the Active Exposure Group. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables will include the number of participants, number and percent of participants with missing data, the mean and standard deviation, geometric means and coefficient of variation (CV) median, first and third quartiles, minimum and maximum, and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each product exposure, and summary across all participants. In addition, the results may be presented as a stratified summary as defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). Analysis of the Primary Endpoint: The primary endpoints will be the pre -event urinary BoExp and latest post two hour urinary BoExp observation. A linear mixed effects model with event type, IAQ, duration of exposure (time between pre -event collection and last post exposure collection), product use status and product use status and event type interaction will be modelled as fixed effects with a random subject effect. Other covariates or interactions terms may be added as needed. Appropriate contrasts will be constructed to determine the effect of passive exposure to IQOS aerosol during the Exposure Event on the mean change in levels of urinary BoExp to selected tobacco specific HPHCs together with the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Other contrasts can be constructed to determine the change in urinary BoExp for subjects with other smoking status after passive exposure to IQOS usage. Analysis of the Secondary Objectives: A similar statistical model as described in the analysis of the primary endpoint will be used to evaluate the levels of exposure to addit ional selected HPHCs representative of ETS during both the Non- Exposure Events and Exposure Events in the study population. The results will also be looked at stratified by incoming smoking status. Additional analysis may be defined in the SAP and performed and reported in the Assessment Study Report."

No part of this document may be publicly disclosed without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A Analysis of the Active Exposure Group: The primary endpoints will look at the change between the pre-event urinary BoExp and latest post two -hour urinary BoExp observation. A linear mixed effects mode l with IAQ, duration of exposure (time between pre -event collection and last post exposure collection) and number of sticks used during the event, will be modelled as fixed effects with a random subject effect. Other covariates or interaction terms may be added as needed. Appropriate contrasts will be constructed to determine the effect of active exposure to IQOS usage during the Exposure E vent on the mean change in levels of urinary BoExp to selected tobacco specific HPHCs together with the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Data processing and analysis of IAQ samples: The IAQ data will be processed at ABF and the individual results per compound will be summarized and tabulated. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) design will be applied as the quantitative results of the IAQ sessions will be compared per compound. The mean, standard deviation, relative standard deviation, minimum and maximum will be computed per compound and the number of observations will be indicated. A significance level set at 0.05 will be used to determine equality between sessions. Sample Size: The sample size of approximately 169 participants in the Exposure and Non-Exposure Events each is based on the expected exposure of a Non-Smoker when exposed to cigarette smoke as documented in the literature. Variability of exposure levels and method variability were furthermore considered to estimate the sample size needed . Adverse Events and Participants Safety and Well -Being: As this study is observational by design and is conducted in a post -market setting, adverse event (AE) reporting will follow the Sponsor’s already established post -market Safety Surveillance Procedures for spontaneously- reported events. All study personnel and study participants will be reminded of the product quality complaints (including AEs) hotline that has been established for all users of IQOS in Japan. In the event that a medical event occurs in any of the study participants the study staff will be advised to call local emergency number to ensure appropriate medical treatment. The related cost for emergency treatment and transportation will be borne by the Sponsor. Security personnel will be on site at the event location to ensure secure and ordered conduct at the event ."

Study participation is by invitation only. 2 INTRODUCTION 2.1 Background 2.1.1 Smoking -Related Diseases and Harm Reduction Strategy Public health authorities, including the World Health Organization (WHO), have concluded that exposure to Environmental Tobacco Smoke (ETS), also named secondhand smoke, which is a mixture of sidestream smoke (tobacco smoke which is emitted from the lit end of a cigarette or cigar) and exhaled smoke, causes heart disease, can cer, as well as respiratory disease and other conditions . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. National Toxicology Program, the U.S. Surgeon General, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer have all classified ETS as carcinogenic [4-8]. For cardiovascular disease (CVD), it is estimated that ETS increases the risk of heart disease by ~30%, accounting for at least 35,000 deaths annually in the United States [9]. Six meta - analyses have been published summarizing data reported over the last 30 years [10-15] yielding relative risks of heart disease from ETS exposure ranging between 1.2 and 1.3. In 2004, Whincup et al published a 20 -year prospective s tudy of ETS exposure and coronary heart disease that estimated that the risk associated with ETS exposure was between 1.45 (95% CI, 1.10 to 2.08) and 1.57 (95% CI, 1.08 to 2.28), depending on the level of ETS exposure [ 16]. A literature review and meta- analysis to systematically evaluate the association between ETS and lung cancer in Japan identified four cohort studies and five case -control studies on which a quantitative synthesis was conducted only for ETS exposure in the home during adulthood. The pooled relative risk of lung cancer associated with secondhand smoke exposure was 1.28 (95% confidence interval: 1.10- 1.48). The authors concluded that ETS exposure in the home during adulthood results in a statistically significant increase in the risk of lung cancer [ 17]. These results are in line with the estimate of the U.S. Surgeon General who estimates that ETS increases a nonsmoker’s chances of developing lung cancer by 20 to 30 percent [ 11] . Philip Morris International (PMI) develops, assesses and commercializes a portfolio of innovative products that have the potential to reduce the risk of smoking- related diseases in"

No part of this document may be publicly disclosed without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A comparison to smoking cigarettes. The objective is to develop products that (1) significantly reduce the risk of smoking- related disease compared to continued smoking of cigarettes and (2) are accepted by smokers as substitutes for cigarettes. One of these novel products is the Tobacco Heating System (THS) which is commercialized in Japan since November 2014 under the brand name IQOS and uses tobacco sticks called HeatSticks (sold in Japan as Marlboro Heatsticks ). IQOS heats the tobacco instead of burning it and the temperature is maintained below 350°C, a temperature much lower than what is observed for cigarettes, which can reach 900°C. More than 6000 smoke constituents have been identified when the tobacco is burned or combusted [18], and more than 100 of them have been categorized as harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHCs) [19]. By heating the tobacco instead of burning it, an aerosol is produced that is not the product of combustion and therefore many of the chemical reactions associated with combustion do not take place. As a result IQOS produces an aerosol with significantly lower levels of HPHCs than cigarette smoke , which is the key to THS’s potential to reduce the risk of smoking- related disease as HPHCs are formed primarily through combustion and pyrolysis in cigarettes. IQOS is composed of the Tobacco Stick Holder and a Charger which recharge s the Holder after each use. IQOS was designed to be used with dedicated Tobacco Sticks, the HeatSticks . Various pre -clinical and clinical studies have been conducted and in summary, the scientific evidence available to date has shown that: 1. The aerosol of IQOS contains on average 90 to 95% lower levels of HPHCs compared to the smoke from a standard reference cigarette [20]. 2. The aerosol of IQOS is on average 90% less toxic compared to the smoke of a standard reference cigarette (cyt otoxicity, bacterial, and mammalian mutagenicity) [21]. 3. In animal models, continuous inhalation and exposure to IQOS aerosol, even at a multiple of the aerosol concentration, resulted in a dramatically lower systemic toxicity, extensively reduced lung inflammation and histopathological changes in the nasal epithelium as well as lung tissue [22]. Furthermore, in an Apoe -/- mouse model, exposure to IQOS aerosol does not enhance cardiovascular disease or emphysema, when compared to cigarette smoke, and switching from cigarette smoke to IQOS aerosol exposure results in a reversal of the aortic plaque growth in a similar manner as Smoking Cessation (SC) [ 22]. 4. PK studies demonstrated comparable nicotine exposure in subjects using IQOS as in subjects using cigarettes [23-26] 5. The exposure reduction to selected HPHCs in current adult smokers switching to IQOS is scientifically substantiated compared to cigarette smoking and is close to"

No part of this document may be publicly disclosed without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A what is observed in adult smokers who stop smoking for the duration of our clinical studies [27-31]. 6. Improvements of cardiovascular and other clinical risk endpoints have been observed in healthy adult smokers who switched to IQOS, similarly to what has been observed in smoking abstinence over a period of up to 3 months [ 29-31]. 7. No safety signals have been detected indicating any new or increased risks of health issues in smokers switching from smoking cigarettes to IQOS . 8. As indicated in markets where IQOS is now available, IQOS has been accepted by smokers (with over 3 million adult users to -date) and appears to be an accept able substitute for current adult smokers with various smoking habits and patterns. An IAQ study conducted showed that, out of 23 analytes assessed, only 2 HPHCs, namely nicotine and acetaldehyde, as well as glycerin were detectable in air following the use of IOQS but at levels that were much lower than the thresholds defined in existing air quality guidelines . These results indicated that IQOS is not a source of ETS. The study therefore showed that, based on existing indoor air quality guidelines, there is no impact on the overall Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) when using IQOS in an indoor environment [ 32, 33]. 2.2 Purpose of the Study The purpose of the study is to show that Non-Smokers exposed to IQOS in a restaurant setting (i.e., through planned dinner “Events”) do not have higher urinary levels of Biomarkers of Exposure (BoExp) to selected HPHCs representative of ETS compared to the urinary levels of BoExp to selected HPHCs representative of ETS caused by background exposure in Non-Smokers before IQOS exposure. Furthermore the impact of passive I QOS exposure on IQOS User s and Cigarette Smokers not using any nicotine or tobacco containing nicotine product will be investigated. The addition of IQOS User s who don’t use IQOS, and Cigarette Smoker s who don’t use any nicotine or tobacco products, allows for of the assessment of individuals with varying levels of exposure to HPHCs in their personal lives, in order to assess whether there is any measurable additive exposure from IQOS. Relatedly, the study will also evaluate IAQ through the assessment of concentrations of selected HPHCs representative of tobacco- specific and IAQ markers in the air during the Event. 2.3 Anticipated Benefits and Risks 2.3.1 Anticipated Benefits There are no major benefits from participating in this study for the overall study population other than to collaborate in the understanding of how the use of IQOS affects by-standers in a real-life setting."

No part of this document may be publicly disclosed without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A 2.3.2 Anticipated Foreseeable Risks due to Study Procedures There are no anticipated risks from participating in this study. The study is conducte d in a real-life setting in an IQOS-only restaurant in Japan where participation of study participants is by invitation-only. 2.3.3 Unforeseeable Risks It is unlikely that any unforeseeable risks will occur from participating in this observational study. However, t he possibility of unforeseeable events/risks will be explained when information about the study is provided. Non -expected malfunction of IQOS may lead to unforeseeable risks. Participants will be informed that IQOS is not demonstrated yet to be less harmful than cigarettes. Mitigation will include close monitoring to detect any unforeseeable risks at the earliest time possible. 3 STUDY OBJECTIVES 3.1 Primary Objective and Endpoints The primary objective of this study is: 1) To estimate the mean change in levels of urinary biomarker of exposure (BoExp) to selected tobacco specific harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHC)s representative of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) after passive exposure to IQOS in a planned restaurant event (‘Exposure Ev ent’) where IQOS use, but not cigarette smoking, is allowed. Mean change in BoExp will be estimated for the Passive Exposure Group and stratified by product use status. Co-primary Endpoints (measured before the start and in the last sample collected prio r to the individual participants’ end of the Events): • Nicotine o BoExp to Nicotine: Nicotine equivalents (NEQ): molar sum of free nicotine, nicotine-glucuronide, free cotinine, cotinine -glucuronide, free trans -3’- hydroxycotinine, trans -3’-hydroxycotinine- glucuronide in spot urine (expressed as concentration adjusted to creatinine) • Tobacco Specific Nitrosamines (TSNAs): 4 -(methylnitrosamino)-1- (3-pyridyl)-1- butanone (NNK) and N- nitrosonornicotine (NNN) o BoExp to Tobacco Specific Nitrosamines (TSNAs): Total 4 - (methylnitrosamino)-1- (3-pyridyl)-1- butanol (Total NNAL) and Total N -"

No part of this document may be publicly disclosed without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A 4.1.1 Step 1: Identification of Participants and Informed Consent : Screening and Enrollment This step involves the identification of participants, and obtaining informed consent prior to the study (Non- Exposure or Exposure Events) . Current adult IQOS User s and Cigarette Smokers will be identified and invited to participate through PMI’s product database . A vendor will identify and recruit Non-Smokers from a panel of existing participants used for other research and survey purposes. Additionally, public advertisements might be used. Potential candidates for participation in the study will be sent a link to a study website to provide information on study details and to complete a Computer -Assisted Self -Interview (CASI) system to assess eligibility and obtain informed consent. After completion of informed consent, the web sys tem proceeds to a “screening domain” of the CASI which is the set of questions and questionnaires to evaluate the participants’ eligibility for participation (i.e., inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible participants). At the end of the “screening dom ain” eligible participants will be directed to the “enrollment domain” to confirm their participation in the study. Eligible participants will be presented with the available dates for the Non -Exposure and Exposure E vents and asked to confirm his / her preferred dates for participation in maximum one Non- Exposure Event and maximum one Exposure Event . Once a participant confirms participation in the study, they are considered enrolled in the study. No data will be recorded in the Study Database for the potential participants that do not consent to participate in the study. After consenting for participation in the study, participants can withdraw from the study at any time .. The contact details of the participants, including personal information and pers onal identifiers will be kept separate from the study data. Subjects will only be compensated for the Non- Exposure or Exposure events they participated in. 4.1.2 Step 2: Non-Exposure Event s The Non- Exposure Events are planned dinner events of 4- hour duration for the individual participant in a restaurant setting with a sufficient number of events ensuring a minimum 169 participants with the following smoking phenotypes: 50% (±5%) of participa nts are Non- Smokers, 25% (±5%) of participants are IQOS User s (not using IQOS), 25% (±5%) of participants are Cigarette Smoker s (not smoking) who are invited to attend a dinner party and enrolled into the study at no cost to them (see Table 1). The Non- Exposure Events are both nicotine - and tobacco- free (i.e., no nicotine or tobacco products are allowed to be used), and participants must agree to this study requirement. This step allows for non-exposure measurements to be obtained in order to estimate levels of primary endpoints in the absence of IQOS exposure."

No part of this document may be publicly disclosed without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A IAQ measurements will be sampled for up to 3h prior to the start of the Event and for 3h after the last participant has entered the Event for 1h. Urine specimens per person will be collected for analysis as follows: The first urine sample will be collected prior to the start of the Event. For the second urine sample, collection will start with the first void after 2 hours of participation in the event to allow sufficient exposure to the event environment to have occurred and therefore detection of BoExp in the urine characterizing the background exposure. From the 2h time point onwards every subsequent void will be collected and the previous urine sample discarded with the last void collected ideally at the end of the 4h exposure period. Only the first and the last urine sample taken (ideally after 4h of participation in the Event) will be analyzed. The time of urine collection will be recorded to ensure that only urine samples taken afte r 2 hours of participation in the Non-Exposure Event are analyzed. Urine specimens will also be used to confirm self -reported non- smoking status of the invited participants. Participants who misstate their non -smoking status will not be included in the final analysis. A fixed menu of food and non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages typically served in Japanese restaurants will ensure homogeneity of types of potential confounders of both IAQ endpoints and BoExp in the unexposed participant group. The overall amount of food consumed per food type and beverages consumed by type will be recorded. 4.1.3 Step 3: Exposure Event s This step comprises the Exposure Events which will occur in the same restaurant setting as the Non- Exposure Events in order to control for restaurant -related exposures that could confound study results. The first of the Exposure Events will occur within 4 weeks of the Non-Exposure Events and will replicate both the meal, beverages and restaurant dynamics (i.e. same location, air ventilation and table setting) of the Non- Exposure Event. Exposure Event participants may or may not have attended a Non-Exposure Event, as this is not a study requirement . Participants attend the dinner event at no cost to themselves. These participants represent the same product use phenotypes as in the Non- Exposure Events, except that IQOS User s will be assigned for the Exposure Events to either a) IQOS User s who will use IQOS during the dinner event, or b) IQOS User s who agree not to use IQOS (or any nicotine or tobacco product) during the dinner event (see Table 1). The Exposure Events will include a minimum of 169 passively exposure participants with the following product use phenotypes: 50% (±5%) Non-Smokers, 25% (±5%) IQOS User s who refrain from u sing any nicotine or tobacco product, and 25% (±5%) Cigarette Smokers who refrain from using any nicotine or tobacco products."

Participants actively using IQOS will enter the event location first and start using IQOS ad- libitum for 1h prior to the other participants (passive Exposure Group) enter ing the event location. IAQ measurements will be sampled for up to 3h prior to the start of the Event and for 3h after the last participant was exposed for 1h.

The overall amount of food consumed per food type and beverages consumed by type will be recorded. 4.2 Rationale for Study Design IQOS is currently used by over 2 million users in Japan. Various restaurants and bars exist where IQOS use is allowed but not CC smoking. This observational study will determine the impact of IQOS use on IAQ and the impact of exposure to environmental tobacco aerosol through measurement of BoExp in urine representative of ETS in a restaurant setting where IQOS use , but not smoking, is allowed. 4.3 Appropriateness of Measurements Nicotine is one of the markers for ETS, however ETS covers several other markers . In this study, ISO Norms related to ETS (15593:2001, 18145:2003 and 11454:1997) are out of scope for indoor air collection as combustion does not occur in THS. Indoor Air Quality Markers selected for assessment in this study are based on:"

Their relevance for air quality 3. Their relative abundance in THS2.2 aerosol (i.e. the most abundant) 4. Gas-phase tobacco non- specific markers The BoExp endpoints to assess passive exposure in humans are accepted biomarkers of exposure to ETS , and were furthermore selected based on the following criteria: 1. Availability of a validated analytical method 2. Measure is known to be directly or indirectly affected by the use of tobacco product 3. Timeframe of metabolic decay in the perspective of the study duration 4. Robustness of the method (rapid, simple, accurate) 5. Limited exposure through other sources than tobacco 4.4 Study Duration The maximum duration of participants in the Passive Exposure Group will be approximately 4h (not exceeding 5h). The maximum duration of active IQOS use by participants in the Active Exposure Group will be up to 8h ( ±15 min). Each participant can participate in maximum one Non-Exposure Event and maximum one Exposure Event. The overall duration of the study is currently planned for 6 weeks, but might be extended based on the number of events needed to secure the necessary number of participants.. End of Study for a participant is defined as the end of the Non- Exposure Event or the last Exposure Event he/she participated in. The overall End of the Study is defined as the end of the last Exposure Event. 5 STUDY POPULATION A sufficient number of female or male Japanese adult IQOS User s, CC smokers , or Non- Smokers to achieve 169 participants in each of the Non-Exposed and Passive Exposure Groups, who meet the Inclusion criteria below , will be enrolled in the study. In addition a sufficient number of IQOS User s, actively using the product during Exposure Events , will be enrolled to ensure that 20% ± 5% o f the available seats of the event location are occupied by 4 ISO Norms related to ETS (15593:2001, 18145:2003 and 11454:1997) are out of scope for indoor air collection as combustion does not occur in THS."

No part of this document may be publicly disclosed without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A Table 3 Test Product (IQOS) Component Description HeatStick The HeatStick is designed to function with the Holder. The HeatStick is made up of: tobacco plug, hollow acetate tube, polymer -film filter, mouth piece filter, outer and mouth- end papers. All materials have been evaluated with regards to their toxicological potential and have been approved for use. The tobacco plug is made from tobacco, glycerin, water, guar gum, cellulose, propylene glycol, natural and artificial flavorings. The average amount of nicotine in the tobacco plug is 4.3- 5.4 mg/stick per HeatStick . Holder The Holder is a slim electrical heating unit that heats the HeatStick in a controlled manner by using a heater blade. The Holder stores enough energy for a single experience, delivering consecutive puffs over a period of about 6 minutes or 14 puffs (whichever comes first). A Light Emitting Diode indicates the end of the experience. Once this cycle is complete, the Holder must be recharged before a new HeatStick can be used. Charger The power supply for the Holder is the Charger. The Charger holds enough energy for approximately 20 uses of the Holder and can be recharged from household power. The Charger stores the Holder when not in use, and provides a secure environment for the cleaning process of the heater blade. The overall objective of the product design is to provide an acceptable experience in which the HPHCs levels in the aerosol are substantially reduced in comparison with the smoke of a cigarette [20, 34]. A summary of description of the product, pre -clinical and clinical data available on IQOS is provided in the SPI [35]. 6.2 Use of Investigational Product(s) Participants in the Active Exposure Group (IQOS use ) will be asked to bring their own IQOS device and HeatSticks for their own use during the entire study period as HeatSticks will not be provided by the Sponsor. Participants in the Active Exposure G roup will use IQOS ad libitum with no Heatsticks variant restrictions . Urine samples collected during the study will also be used to verify self- reported smoking status as well as compliance with protocol restrictions on IQOS and cigarette use during the events."

Each sampling case are equipped with: • 2 x AD-4 traps for Nic otine and 3-EP collection operated at a flow rate of 1.0 L/min for 3h; • 2 x 1 DNPH- silica traps for carbonyl collection (acetalde hyde, acrolein, crotonaldehyde and formaldehyde) operated at a flow rate of 1.2 L/min sequentially for 1h • 2 glass fiber filters (Cambridge filters) spiked with ascorbic acid for TSNAs (NNN ; NNK), operated at a flow rate of 1.0 L/min for 3h. The position of the sampling cases will be inside the breathing zone as described by ASHRAE.5 Moreover, two small instruments in front of the sampling cases are electronically recording the ambient temperature and relative humidity. In addition, two portable instruments, used for on-line PM1 -PM10 particle measurements will be used. The equipment ar e the property of PMI and will be used by a PMI-trained scientist according to the ISO accredited method PMI-RRP-WKI-111642 “Dust Trax characterization for real time monitoring of aerosol mass concentration”. The analytical methods to be applied at the ana lyzing laboratory ( see Appendix B .) for the air samples are listed in Table 4. 5 ASHRAE, 2016. ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.1 -2016.

A linear mixed effects model with event type, IAQ, duration of exposure (time between pre -event collection and last post exposure collection), product use status and product use status and event type interaction will be modelled as fixed effe cts with a random subject effect. Other covariates or interactions terms may be added as needed. Appropriate contrasts will be constructed to determine the effect of passive exposure to IQOS aerosol during the Exposure Event on the mean change in levels of urinary BoExp to selected tobacco specific HPHCs together with the 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Other contrasts can be constructed to determine the change in urinary BoExp for subjects with other smoking status after passive exposure to IQOS usage 12.5 Secondary Analysis The same statistical model described in the analysis of the primary endpoint will be used to analyze to evaluate the levels of exposure to additional selected HPHCs representative of ETS during both the Non- Exposure Events and Exposure Event s in the study population. The results will also be looked at stratified by incoming smoking status. Additional analysis may be defined in the SAP and performed and reported in the Assessment Study Report. The IAQ data will be processed at the assess ing laboratory (see Appendix B ) and the individual results per compound will be summarized and tabulated.

No part of this document may be publicly disclosed without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A any other details relating to identifiable person (e.g., address). The assignment of a participant number/code for participant identification will be based on the appropriate data protection rules. Any documents that allow full identification of the participant (e.g., the participant’s sig ned ICF) must be maintained in confidence by the Principal Investigator. If any document relating to this study shows a participant’s name or any other details relating to an identifiable person (e.g., address ), the name or other identifiable details must be obscured before a copy of that document is supplied to the Sponsor. PRX staff will have access to email, geo graphical data and phone number as well as other personal data (i.e. passport check). In the exceptional case where a participant a) is recruited into the study through PMP’s Product Registration Database, and b) communicates in any way their intention to quit smoking or stop using IQOS, their email address will be shared with PMP so that this participant no longer receives any commercial communication from the Sponsor moving forward. No other identifiers will be shared with the Sponsor so that no study data will be linked to that email address. 13.3 Access to Source Document ation Participants enrolled in the study will be informed that, during the course of the study, the Sponsor, any authorized representatives of the Sponsor, IRB, or regulatory authorities may inspect the information collected, and ensure that all personal information made available for inspection is handled in the strictest confidence and in accordance with national and local data protection and privacy legislation. The Principal Investigator and all study site collaborators involved with the study must permit direct access to source data/documents for study related monitoring, audits, IRB review, and regulatory inspection(s). 13.4 Record Retention All records of data, source data and source documents (original records or certified copies), in any form (including, but not limited to, written, electronic, magnetic, optical records and test results) that describe or record the methods, conduct, and/or results of the study, the factors affecting the study, and the actions taken will be maint ained by the Principal Investigator for the study. After the finalization of the study the Principal Investigator can request that all study related files (Essential study documents/records, which individually and collectively permit evaluation of the cond uct of a study and the quality of the data produced) are transferred to the Sponsor. The Sponsor will perform a quality control check for completeness of the data prior to accepting the request.

No part of this document may be publicly disclosed without the written consent of Philip Morris Products S.A permit evaluation of the conduct of a study and the quality of the data produced must be retained by the Sponsor for a minimum of: • At least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study, or • At least 2 years depending on, for example, the circumstances, or • After formal discontinuation of clinical development of the IP. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the Sponsor. Examples of essential records/documents include, but are not limited to: • Signed informed consent documents for all participants and master ICF • Participant identification code list, enrollment log (if applicable) • Record of all communications between the Principal Investigator and the IRB, composition of the IRB • Record of all communications/contact between the Principal Investigator, Sponsor, and its authorized representatives • Study specific questionnaires (and associated data/scoring), CASI data • All other source documents (e.g., laboratory records) or any electronically captured study source data • Record of any body fluids or tissue samples collected and retained • Information regarding participants’ discontinuation. The Principal Investigator (until transfer to the Sponsor is complete) and the Sponsor (after completion of the transfer) must take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents. If the Principal Investigator wishes to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location during or after the study , the Sponsor must be notified in advance. The Principal Investigator must obtain written approval from the Sponsor before destruction of any records. Normally, these records will be held in the Principal Investigator ’s archives. If the Principal Investigator is unable to meet this obligation, they must ask the Sponsor for permission to make alternative arrangements. Details of these arrangements must be documented. In case the Principal Investigator has agreed with the Sponsor to transfer the files to the Sponsor it is the obligation of the Sponsor to document the destruction of the records according to local law and regulations. The Sponsor or Sponsor’s authorized representative will maintain docume ntation relating to the study for 15 years after the Study Report has been finalized."
