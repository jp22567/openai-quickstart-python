Amendment 08 / Global 03-JAN-2020 1. Based on results from the KN181 study, 3 primary objectives and corresponding h ypotheses were added: OS in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) population; OS in ESCC whose tumors ar ePD-L1 biomarker -positive (CPS ≥10) population; and PFS in ESCC population. 2.Secondary objectives updated accordingl y with respect to ORR and DOR endpoints in the ESCC and ESCC PD -L1 CPS ≥10populations. Exploratory objectives were updated for PFS per irRECIST in the ESCC and ESCC PD -L1 CPS ≥10populations. 3. Due to the short interval (~5 months) between the last subject enrolled in the Global Cohort (n=711) and in the China Extens ion Study (n=38), these 2 subject groups are merged into 1 “Global Study ” for the primary analyses (N=749). 4.To include assessment of DOR, QoL (C30) and QoL (OES18) in all pre - specified populations.

Added numbering of the hypotheses to Figure 3.The minimum alpha spending strategyensures that the actual spending will be no more aggressive than the planned, while at the same time ensuring thatnot all alpha is spent prior to final planned event counts. By using this more conservative spending early in the study, power can be retained to detect situations where the treatment effect may be delayed. 8.8.1.1; 8.8.1.2 Progression- free Survival, Overall SurvivalTable 16 describing the efficacy boundaries and properties for PFS anal yses was updated based on investigator assessment.

After a screening phase of 28days, each subject will be assigned to receive trial treatment until disease progression is confirmed by the site per immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST) ,unacceptable adverse event(s), intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, investigator’s decision to discontinue the subject, noncompliance with trial treatment or procedure requirements or administrative reasons requiring cessation of treatment, or until the subject has received 35 administrations of pembrolizumab/placebo (approximately 2 years).After the end of treatment, each subject will be followed for the occurrence of adverse events and spontaneously reported pregnancy as described under Section 7.2– Assessing and Recording Adverse Events . Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than disease progression will have post-treatment follow-up for disease status until disease progression is confirmed bythe site per irRECIST , initiating a non-study cancer treatment, withdrawing consent, or becoming lost to follow-up. All subjects will be followed by telephone for overall survival until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study.

Beginning with screening, all imaging assessments will be submitted for central imaging vendor review and will be evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 for determining assessment of response. On-study imaging assessment s will be performed every 9 weeks (63 days ± 7 days) following the date of randomization until progression of disease is documented with radiologic imaging (computed tomograph y [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging[MRI]). Imaging timing should follow calendar days and should not be adjusted for delay s in cycle starts. Theprimary efficacy endpoints are overall survival (OS)and progression -free survival (PFS). The primary PFS analysis will be based on RECIST 1.1 by investigator assessment . RECIST 1.1 will be used by the local site for treatment decisions until verification of progressive disease (PD)by the central imaging vendor. Following verification of PD by the central imaging vendor, treatment decisions may be made by the adaptation of RECIST 1.1, asdescribed in Section 7.1.2. 5.5 –irRECIST Assessment of Disease , termed immune -related RECIST (irRECIST),to accommodate for the tumor response patterns seen with pembrolizumab treatment (eg, tumor flare).This was first described by Nishino, et al. 2013 [1], but is further modified for the programmed cell death -1 (PD-1)program. For a clinically stable subject with first radiologic evidence of PD, it is at the discretion of the site investigator to continue treating the subject with study medication until PD is confirmed at least 4 weeks from the date of the firs t tumor imaging suggesting PD per the site investigator. If radiologic PD is confirmed by the subsequent tumor imaging,the subject should be discontinued from treatment unless, in the opinion of the investigator, the subject is achieving a clinically meaningful benefit; an exception to continue treatment may be considered following consultation with the Sponsor. 05J432"

Based on preclinic al in vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD-1. Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in clinical development as an intravenous (IV) immunotherapy for advanced malignancies. Keytruda™ (pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of indications. For more details on specific indications refer to the Investigator ’sBrochure(IB). Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background The importance of intact immun e surveillance function in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformations has been known for decades [2] . Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various malignancies. In particular, the presence of CD8+ T-cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T- cells/FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells correlates with improved prognosis and long -term survival in solid malignancies, such as ovarian, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer; hepatocellular carcinoma; malignant melanoma; and renal cell carcinoma . Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes can be expanded ex vivo and reinfused, inducing durable objective tumor responses in cancers such as melanoma [3] [4] . The PD-1 receptor-ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune control. The normal function of PD-1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T-cells under healthy conditions, is to down-modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune reactions. PD-1 (encoded by the gene PDCD1) is an immunoglobulin superfamily member related to cluster of differentiation 28and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4)that has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement of its ligands (PD- L1 and/or PD -L2) [5] [6]. The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved [7]. PD-1 and its family members are ty pe 1 transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig variable–type domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail responsible for the binding of signaling molecules. The cytoplasmic tail of PD-1 contains 2 tyrosine-based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif, and an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif. Following T-cell stimulation, PD-1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases, SHP-1 and SHP-2, to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based switch motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphory lation of effector molecules such as CD3 zeta, protein kinase C- theta, and zeta-chain-associated protein kinase, which areinvolved in the CD3 T-cell signaling cascade [8] [9] [10][6]. The mechanism by which PD-1 down-modulates T-cell responses is similar to, but distinct from, that of CTLA-4, because both molecules regulate an overlapping set of signaling proteins[11] [12]. As a consequence, the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is an attractive target for therapeutic inter vention in advanced/ metastatic esophageal cancer . 05J432"
26,page_26,"Product: MK-3475 26 Protocol/Amendment No.: 590-09 MK-3475-590-09 FinalProtocol 17-Jun-2020 Confidential Pre-clinical and Clinical Trials Therapeutic studies in mouse models have shown that administration of antibodies blocking PD-1/PD-L1 interaction enhances infiltration of tumor-specific CD8+ T-cells and leads ultimately to tumor rejectio n, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatment modalities. Anti-mouse PD-1 or anti-mouse PD-L1 antibodies have demonstrated antitumor responses as a monotherapy in models of squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, melanoma, and colorectal carcinoma. Blockade of the PD-1 pathway effectively promoted CD8+ T-cell infiltration into the tumor and the presence of interferon gamma, granzyme B, and perforin, indicating that the mechanism of action involved local infiltration and activation of effector T-cell function in vivo [13] [3] [4][14] [6] [5]. Experiments have confirmed the in vivo efficacy of PD-1 blockade as a monotherapy as well as in combination with chemotherap y in syngeneic mouse tumor models (s ee the IB for further details ). Clinical trials have demonstrated efficacy in subjects with advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, triple-negative breast cancer, and gastric adenocarcinoma. Ongoing Clinical Trials Ongoing clinical trials of pembrolizumab are being conducted in advanced melanoma, NSCLC, and a number of other advanced solid tumor indications and hematologic malignancies . For details on all ongoing pembrolizumab studies, refer to the IB. Ongoing Clinical Trials in Esophageal Cancer Two trials are currently ongoing with pembrolizumab in esophageal cancer. KEYNOTE (KN) 180 is a Phase II study of pembrolizumab monotherap y in third-line previously treated subjects with advanced/metastatic adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus or advanced/metastatic Siewert type 1adenocarcinoma of the EGJ. This open-label trial completed enrollment 21-Mar-2017with 121 subjects allocated to treatment. The second study, KN181, is a Phase III,randomized ,open-label study of single-agent pembrolizumab versusphysicians’choice of single-agent docetaxel, paclitaxel, or irinotecan in subjects with advanced/metastatic adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus or advanced/metastatic Siewert type 1adenocarcinoma of the EGJthat have progressed after first-line standard therapy. As of 16-Jun-2017, KN181 has completed enrollment of 629 subjects in the global cohort out of a total ofapproximately 600 planned. Information on Other Trial -related Therapy Cisplatin is a platinum-based chemotherap ythatacts by interfering with DNA replication , and 5-FU is a fluoropyrimidine that interferes with DNA synthesis to inhibit tumor growth. Cisplatin and 5-FU are currently recommended by guidelines for first-line treatment of subjects with advanced/metastatic esophageal cancer.

In developing countries; however, esophageal cancer is endemic and is the fourthmost common cause of cancer deaths. Globally,close to 480,000cases occur annua lly,with 53% of these cases arising in China [15] [16]. In the US, in 2015, an estimated 15,980 esophageal cancers wereexpected to be diagnosed and it is estimated that 15,590 people wouldeventually die of their disease [17]. In Japan, esophageal cancer is the sixthleading cause of cancer deaths,and in 2008,there were 11,746deaths from esophageal carcinoma ,with male patients outnumbering female patients 6:1 [18]. The majority of patients arediagnosed with advanced/metastatic cancer and,in this setting, response to chemotherapeutic agents is poor. Given the high incidence and mortality worldwide and lack of good therapeutic options,esophageal cancer patients represent a high unmet need for drug development. The geographical distribution of esophageal cancer varies widely,with a 60-fold difference between high-and low-prevalence regions. High-prevalence areas include Asia, Africa,and France,where squamous esophageal cancers predominate [19]. A dramatic shift in the histology and locationof upper gastrointestinal (GI) tumors has occurred over the past decades. In Western countries, adenocarcinoma is the more predominant histology, with the most common site of esophageal cancer being in the lower third of the esophagus , which often involves the EGJ[20] [21] [22]. For the purpose of thisstudy, the Siewert classification will be used for adenocarcinoma of the EGJ,and thus,type 1patients (about 20% of the EGJ adenocarcinoma patients) will beeligible. Siewert type 1tumors are adenocarcinomas of the lower esophagus with the center located within 1to 5centimeters above the anatomic EGJ. Type 2 and 3Siewert adenocarcinomas of the EGJ are managed as gastric cancer patients,and therefore, would be eligible to participate in the first-line gastric trial, KN062. Adenocarcinoma has been gradually increasing in men of all ethnic backgrounds and also in women[23]. Squamous cell carcinoma seems to bemore sensitive to chemotherap y, chemoradiation, and radiation therapy than adenocarcinoma, but the long-term outcome is similar for both histologies [24] [25],thus emphasizing the need for improved ther apies in both histologies. Phase III trials specifically designed for metastatic esophageal cancers have not been performed ,and there is no definitive standard of care. Current guidelines for first-line treatment of advanced/metastatic esophageal cancer recommend combination treatment with platinum-based chemotherap y in combination with fluoropyrimidine as palliative therapy, with the combination of cisplatin and 5-FU being the most commonly used across regions. Docetaxel, paclitaxel ,and irinotecan are included as options for second-line therapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. Other regimens included in the guidelines for patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease are derived from the gastric adenocarcinoma Phase III trials that have included patients with lower esophageal and/or EGJ cancer. KN028 is a nonrandomized, multicohort, Phase 1b trial of pembrolizumab for PD-L1-positive advanced solid tumors that includes esophageal cancer patients. Key 05J432"

Pembrolizumab 10mg/kg is administered every 2 weeks for up to 2 years or until confirmed PD. Of the 90patientswith esophageal cancer who have been screened, 37 (44.6%) have had PD-L1-positivetumors. Of the 23 patients treated between March and December 2014, 83% were men,and the median age was 65 years. Histology was squamous in 18 patients (78.3%) and adenocarcinoma in 5 patients (21.7%). Eighty-seven percent of patients received ≥ 2 prior therapies for metastatic disease; all patients received ≥ 1 platinum-based therapy. As of the data cutoff (20-Feb-2017), median follow-up was 7 months (range, 1 to 33 months). Treatment -related AEs occurred in nine patients (39%), most commonl y decreased appetite, decreased lymphocyte count, generalized rash, and rash in two patients (9%) each. Grade 3 treatment -related AEs occurred in four patients (17%) and included decreased lymphocyte count in two patients (9%) and decreased appetite, liver disorder, and generalized rash in one patient (4%) each.There were no Grade4 drug-related AEs, and no patients di ed due to a drug-related AE.Tumor shrinkage was seen in 52% of patients and ORR was 30%(95% confidence interval [CI], 13% to 53%) with seven responses confirmed partial responses (5 squamous [ 28%] and 2 adenocarcinoma [40%] ). Stable disease was seen in 9% (N= 2) and PD in 59% (N= 13). Median time to initial response was 4 months (range, 2 to 8 months) and median duration of response was 15 months (range, 6 to 26+ months)for the patients in the esophageal cohort. KN-180 is a Phase 2open-label, interventional, single-arm study of pembrolizumab monotherap y in previously treated subjects with advanced/metastatic EAC or ESCCor advanced/metastatic Siewert type 1 adenocarcinoma of the EGJ. This open-label trial completed enrollment at 57 sites in 10 countries on 21-MAR-2017 with 121 subjects allocated to treatment. Patients had advanced, metastatic esophageal cancer that progressed after 2 or more lines of therapy and had evaluable tumor samples for biomarkers. Pembrolizumab 200 mg was administered intravenousl y every 3 weeksuntil disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or study withdrawal, for up to 2 years. As of 17- AUG-2018, of 121 enrolled patients (100 m alesand 21 females; median age, 65 y ears [range, 33-87 years]), 18 (14.9%) had undergone 3 or more prior therapies, 63 (52.1%) had ESCC, and 58 (47.9%) had tumors positive for programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), defined as a combined positive score of 10 or higher assessed by immunohistochemistry . Median duration of follow-up was 5.8 months (range, 0.2to 27.8 months). Objective response rate was 9.9% (95% CI, 5.2%-16.7%) among all patients (12 of 121), and median duration of response was not reached (range, 2.1 to 25.1+ months). Objective response rate was 14.3% (95% CI , 6.7%- 25.4%) among patients with ESCC (9 of63), 5.2% (95% CI, 1.1%-14.4%) among patients with adenocarcinoma (3 of 58), 13.8% (95% CI, 6.1%-25.4%) among patients with PD-L1- positive tumors (8 of 58), and 6.3% (95% CI, 1.8%-15.5%) among patients with PD-L1- negative tumors (4 of 63).

In the ESCCsubpopulation, pembrolizumab demonstrated a favorable OS benefit compare d with SOC ; the median OS for pembrolizumab was 8.2months versus 7.1months for SOC. The OS rate of pembrolizumab versus SOC at 6 months was 61.1% and 58.8% respectively ; and at 12 months was 38.9% and 24.9%, respectivel y The ORR was 16.7% for pembrolizumab and 7.4% for SOC. In the overall study population ,the median OS for pembrolizumab and SOC was 7.1 months. The ORR in all subjects was 13.1% for pembrolizumab and 6.7% for SOC. Confirmed complete response (CR) was reported in 9 subjects in the pembrolizumab arm and 2 subjects in the SOC arm. I n anadditional analysis in ESCC subjects whose tumors expressed PD-L1 CPS ≥10,there was significant clinical benefit with a median OS for pembrolizumab of10.3 months versus 6.7 months for SOC. The OS rate of pembrolizumab versus SOC at 6 months was 65.9% and 52.7% respectivel y; and at 12 months was 4 7.1% and 22.6%, respectively . The ORR was 22.4% for pembrolizumab and 7.3% for SOC. These data underscore the superior OS with pembrolizumab monotherap y in a late line setting in esophageal cancer patients . Thus, pembrolizumab has an acceptable safety profile and provides highly promising antitumor activity in patients with heavily pretreated, advanced esophageal carcinoma. The high unmet need, lack of efficacious approved therapies,and the above data with pembrolizumab strongly support further development of this drug in first-line patientswith advanced/ metastatic esophageal carcinoma, across both the squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma histologies. Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen /Modification Justification for Treatment Regimen There are currentl y no Phase IIIclinicaltrial data or approved therapy forfirst-line advanced/ metastatic esophageal cancer, and no standard chemotherap y regimen has been established . Various palliative chemotherap y regimens have been investigated in esophageal cancer studies and have been shown to have at least some activity in the first-line setting, with responses ranging from 20% to 48% and 5-year survival rates of approximately 15%, with significant toxicity rates[26].Current National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines recommend the combination of a fluoropyrimidine (5-FUor capecitabine) with platinum agents (cisplatin, oxaliplatin ,or carboplatin) , either alone or in combination with a third drug such as epirubicin or a taxane, as the most effective first-line treatment option.The most common regimen of 5-FU plus cisplatin has resulted in response rates of 13% to 35.9%, disease control rates of 57% to 63.9 %, median PFSof 3.6 months, and median survivalof 5.5 to 6.7months in reported P hase II trials [27] [28] [29] [30]. 05J432"

Toxicity was more severe in the combination arm compared with cisplatin aloneand included Grade 4 aplasia and septicemia, meningeal hemorrhage, cerebrovascular ev ent, and ischemia of lower limb [27]. A Phase II study by theJapan Esophageal Oncology Group evaluated a first-line regimen of 20mg/m2cisplatin plus 5-FU at 800 mg/m2/day (continuous for Days 1to 5), repeated every 4weeks(Q4W), in subjects with advanced/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma . Overall response rate was 33.3%,with median response duration of 5.7 months and OSof 6.6months. Hematological (including Grade 3 neutropenia and thrombocy topenia) and GI (nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis) toxicities were the most commonadverse reactions observed [28]. A German study of cisplatin (100 mg/m2) plus 5-FU (1000 mg/m2/day continuous Days 1to 5), repeated Q4W , alone or in combination with cetuximab (400 mg/m2) was performed in patients with advanced ESCC. Objective response rates were modestly higher in the cetuximab combination arm at 34% compared with30% with cetuximab plus 5-FU alone, while confirmed response rates were lower for both, at 19% and 13%, respectively. Median PFS and OS were also longer in the cetuximab arm, at5.9 and 9.5 months, respectively, compared withthe cisplatin plus 5-FU arm at 3.6 and 5.5 months, respectivel y, although differences were not statistically different. The most common Grade3to 4 AEswere neutropenia, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue , and thrombocytopenia [29]. In the NCCN clinical practice guideline, a combination of 5-FU(750to1000mg/m2/day continuous infusion, Days 1to 4), and cisplatin (75to 100 mg/m2, 29to 35 day cycle) is listed as a recommended regimen for the first-line setting (Esophageal NCCN and ESMO guidelines). While cisplatin doses of 100 mg/m2Q4W may be the preferred dose in Non-Asian clinical trials, doses of 60 to 80 mg/m2are more common for Asian patients. The proposed doses of 80 mg/m2cisplatin and 800 mg/m2/day (Days 1to 5) 5-FU in combination with pembrolizumab Q3W have been evaluated in a cohort of first-line subjects with gastric cancer (KN059),in which the combination was shown to have a manageable safety profile with no treatment -related discontinuations or deaths. The most common treatment -related AEswere nausea (52%), stomatitis (52%), decreased neutrophils (48%), and decreased appetite (44%) [31]. Rationale for Fixed Dose Pembrolizumab The planned dose of pembrolizumab for this trial is 200 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W). Based on the totality of data generated in the pembrolizumab development program, 200 mg Q3W is the appropriate dose of pembrolizumab across all indications and regardless of tumor type. As outlined below, this dose is justified by : •Clinical data from eight randomized studies demonstrating flat dose-and exposure- efficacy relationships from 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/kg every two weeks (Q2W) 05J432"
31,page_31,"Product: MK-3475 31 Protocol/Amendment No.: 590-09 MK-3475-590-09 FinalProtocol 17-Jun-2020 Confidential•Clinical data showing meaningful improvement in benefit-risk including overall survival at 200 mg Q3W across multiple indications •Pharmacology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulation (inferred from pharmacokinetic [PK] data) and tumor (inferred from physiologically based pharmacokinetic [PBPK] anal ysis) at 200 mg Q3W Among the eight randomized dose -comparison studies, a total of 2262 subjects were enrolled with melanoma and NSCLC, covering different disease settings (treatment naïve, previously treated, PD -L1 enriched and all -comers) and different treatment settings (monotherapy and in combination with chemotherap y). Five studies compared 2 mg/kg Q3W vs. 10 mg/kg Q3W (KN001 B2, KN001 D, KN002, KN010 and KN021), and three studies compared 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. 10 mg/kg Q2W (KN001 B3, KN001 F2 and KN006). All of these studies demonstrated flat dose-and exposure-response relationships across the doses studied representing an approximate 5 to 7.5 fold difference in exposure. The 2 mg/kg (or 200 mg fixed-dose) Q3W provided similar responses to the highest doses studied. Subsequently , flat dose-/exposure -response relationships were also observed in other tumor types including head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, gastric cancer and classical Hodgkin Lymphoma, confirming 200 mg Q3W as the appropriate dose independent of the tumor type. These findings are consistent with the mechanism of action of pembrolizumab, which acts by interaction with immune cells, and not via direct binding to cancer cells. Additionally , pharmacology data clearly show target saturation at 200 mg Q3W. First, PK data inKN001 evaluating target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD) conclusively demonstrated saturation of PD-1 in systemic circulation at doses much lower than 200 mg Q3W. Secondly, a PBPK analysis was conducted to predict tumor PD-1 saturation over a wide range of tumor penetration and PD-1 expression. This evaluation concluded that pembrolizumab at 200 mg Q3W achieves full PD -1 saturation in both blood and tumor. Finally, population PK analysis of pembrolizumab, which characterized the influence of body weight and other subject covariates on exposure, has shown that the fixed-dosing provides similar control of PK variability as weight-based dosing, with considerable overlap in the distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2 mg/kg Q3W dose. Supported by these PK characteristics and given that fixed-dose has advantages of reduced dosing complexity and reduced potential of dosing errors, the 200 mg Q3W fixed-dose was selected for evaluation across all pembrolizumab protocols. Rationale for Endpoints Rationale for Efficacy Endpoints 4.2.3.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoints Overall survival has been recognized as the gold standard for the demonstration of superiority of a new antineoplastic therapy in randomized clinical studies. Achieving superiority in OS;however, is likely to be complicated by the availability of multiple post-progression therapies being available to subjects as second-line treatment. Therefore, 05J432"
32,page_32,"Product: MK-3475 32 Protocol/Amendment No.: 590-09 MK-3475-590-09 FinalProtocol 17-Jun-2020 Confidentialthis trial will use a dual endpoint of OS and PFS. Progression -free survival is an acceptable measure of clinical benefit for a late stage trial that demonstrates superiority of a new antineoplastic therapy, especially if the magnitude of the effect is large and the therapy has an acceptable risk/benefit profile. The use of a central imaging vendor and RECIST 1.1 to assess PFS is typically considered acceptable by regulatory authorities. Images will be read by a central imaging vendor blinded to treatment assignment to minimize bias in the response assessments. In addition, the final determination of radiologic progression will be based on the central assessment of progression, rather than a local site investigator/radiology assessment. Real-time determination of radiologic progression as determined by central review will be communicated to the site. Standard RECIST 1.1 will be used by the local site for treatment decisions until the occurrence of PD that is verified bythe central imaging vendor. Following verification of PD by the central imaging vendor , treatment decision may be made by the adaptation of RECI ST 1.1, as outlined in Section 7.1.2.5.5 –irRECIST Assessmentof Diseaseand termed irRECIST. Immunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab may produce antitumor effects by potentiating endogenous cancer-specific immune responses , which may be functionally anergic. Recruitment of immune cells to tumor sit es may result in a transient increase in the size of existing tumor lesions or the appearance of new lesions. Standard RECI ST may not accurately capture the response to immunotherapeuticagents such as pembrolizumab. When feasible, subjects should not bediscontinued until progression is confirmed by subsequent tumor imaging as assessed by the investigator. This allowance to continue treatment despite initial radiologic progression takes into account the observation that some subjects can have a transient tumor flare in the first few months after the start of immunotherapy but with subsequent disease response. Change in primary endpoint of PFS from BICR to investigator- assessed Based on recent medical monitoring review,there wasgreater than anticipated discordance rate (~27%) between blinded independent central review (BICR)-assessed PD and investigator -assessed PD. This has led to a higher than expected censoring of PFSevents;in many of these instances, investigators decided to initiate nextline oftreatment without PD confirmation by BICR. The investigator assessment is based onpatient’s overall status including signs of clinical progression factored into their assessment of radiographic PD while BICR assessment of PD issolely based on radiographic progression. Sponsor, investigators and central readers are blinded to study treatment. Thus, the protocol is amended for the PFS endpoint to be changed from BICR-assessment to investigator - assessment. 4.2.3.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Objective response ratebased on RECIST 1.1 and assessed by investigator , as well as DOR based on RECIST 1.1 assessed by investigator , are commonly accepted endpoints by both regulatory authorities and the oncology community . 05J432"
33,page_33,"Product: MK-3475 33 Protocol/Amendment No.: 590-09 MK-3475-590-09 FinalProtocol 17-Jun-2020 Confidential Immune-related RECIST RECIST 1.1 will be adapted to account for the unique tumor response characteristics seen following the treatment of pembrolizumab. Immunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab may produce antitumor effects by potentiating endogenous cancer-specific immune responses. The response patterns seen with such an approach may extend beyond the typical time course of responses seen with cytotoxic agents, and subjects may manifest a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the appearance of new lesions. Standard RECIST 1.1 may, therefore, not provide an accurate response assessment of immunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizumab. Based on an analysis of subjects with melanoma enrolled in KN001, 7% of evaluable subjects experienced delayed or early tumor pseudo-progression. Of note, subjects who had PD by RECIST 1.1,but not by irRECIST ,had longer OSthan subjects with PD by both criteria. Additionall y, the data suggest that RECIST 1.1 may underestimate the benefit of pembrolizumab in approximately 15% of subjects. These findings support the need to apply a modification to RECI ST 1.1 that takes into account the unique patterns of at ypical response in immunotherapy and enables treatment bey ond initial radiographic progression. The irRECIST assessment is based on RECIST 1.1 and is adapted to account for the unique tumor response seen with immunotherape utics as described by Nishino et al.[1]. The assessment of unidimensional target lesions and response categories per irRECIST are identical to RECIST 1.1. However, the Sponsorhas implemented an adaptation related to new lesions, non- target lesions, and tumor burden assessment in order to confirm radiographic progression. irRECIST will be used by local site investigators to assesstumor response and progression and to make treatment decisions, as well as to be used by the central imaging vendor in support of the PFS endpoint. For further information onirRECIST, see Section 7.1.2.5.5–irRECIST Assessment of Disease. Rationale for Patient -reported Outcomes Symptomatic improvement is considered a clinical benefit and accepted by health authorities as additional evidence on the risk-benefit profile of any new treatment. As part of the analyses for this trial, subjects will provide information regarding their health-related quality of life via the following assessment tools: EORTCQLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-OES18, and EuroQol EQ-5D-5L. These measures are not pure efficacy or safety endpoints because they are affected by both disease progression and treatment tolerability . Details on these instruments are provided in Section 7.1.2.6.2 –Electronic Patient -reported Outcomes . Rationale for Safety Endpoints Safety parameters commonly used for evaluating investigational systemic anticancer treatments are included as safety endpoints including, but not limited to, the incidence of, causality, and outcome of AEs/SAEs; and changes in vital signs and laboratory values.

Preliminary data indicate that this association between tumor PD-L1 expression and response to pembrolizumab may also be true in additional cancer types (eg, triple- negative breast cancer, head and neckcancer,and gastriccancer), therefore, thisrelationship was also evaluated in esophageal cancer. An interim database lock of a subset of KN180 subjects (N = 105) was used as training set to evaluate the utility of a PD-L1 CPS across a range of cut points in identifying subjects with esophageal cancer that respond to pembrolizumab. Combined positive scoreis defined as the percentage of tumor cells and mononuclear inflammatory cells within the tumor nests and the adjacent supporting stroma expressing PD -L1 at any intensity. For those subjects that had esophageal tumor PD-L1 scores of CPS≥10(approxima tely 45% of subjects), both ORR and survival were significantly improved compared with either the all-comers population or the population with CPS <10. This cut point also maintained good sensitivity to detect responders as well as prevalence across esophageal tumors, compared with other cut points.Programmed cell death-ligand 1CPS≥10 will be used in KN590 as part of the primary objectives outlined in section 3.1 above. 4.2.3.4.2 Biomarker Research for Exploratory Objectives Introduction: Cancer immunotherapies represent an important and novel class of antitumor agents. However, the mechanism of action of these exciting new therapies is not completel y understood and much remains to be learned regarding how best to leverage these new drugs in treating patients. Thus, to aid future patients, it is important to investigate the determinants of response or resistance to cancer immunotherapy as well as determinants of AEsin the course of our clinical trials. These efforts will identify novel predictive/pharmacod ynamic biomarkers and generate information that will better guide single-agent and combination therapy with immuno-oncology drugs. To identify novel biomarkers, biospecimens (ie, blood components, tumor material) will be collected to support analyses of cellular components (eg, protein, DNA, RNA,metabolites )and other circulating molecules . Investigations may include but are not limited to: Germline (blood) genetic analyses (eg, single nucleotide polymorphism analyses, whole exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing): This research will evaluate whether genetic variation within a clinical trial population correlates with response to the treatment(s) under evaluation. If genetic variation is found to predict efficacy or AEs, the data might inform optimal use of therapies in the patient population. Furthermore, it is important to evaluate germline DNA variation across the genome in order to interpret tumor-specific DNA 05J432"

Finally, MSImay be evaluated ,as this is an important biomarker for some cancers (eg,colorectal cancer). Genetic (DNA) analyses from tumor:The application ofnew technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, has provided scientists the opportunity to identify tumor -specific DNA changes ( eg, mutations, methy lation status, MSI). Key molecular changes of interest to immune-oncology drug development include the mutational burden of tumors and the clonality of T-cells in the tumor microenvironment. I ncreased mutational burden (sometimes referred to as a ‘hyper-mutated’ state) may generate neo-antigen presentation in the tumor microenvironment. To conduct this type of research, it is important to identify tumor- specific mutations that occur across all genes in the tumor genome. Thus, genome wide approaches may be used for this effort. Note that in order to understand tumor-specific mutations, it is necessary to compare the tumor genome with the germline genome. Microsatellite instability may also be evaluated ,as this is an important biomarke r for some cancers (eg, colorectal cancer). Tumor and blood RNA analyses: Both genome-wide and targeted mRNAexpression profiling and sequencing in tumor tissue and in blood may be performed to define gene signatures that correlate toclinical response to treatment with pembrolizumab or other immunotherapies. Pembrolizumab induces a response in tumors that likely reflectsan inflamed/immune phenotype. Specific immune-related gene sets (ie,those capturing interferon -gamma transcriptional pathways) may be evaluated and new signatures may be identified. Individual genes related to the immune system may also be evaluated (eg, IL-10). MicroRNA profiling may also be pursued. Proteomics and immunohistochemistry using blood or tumor: Tumor and blood samples fr om this study may undergo proteomic anal yses. Additional tumor or blood -derived proteins may also correlate with response to pembrolizumab. Therefore, tumor tissue may be subjected to proteomic analyses using a variety of platforms that could include, bu t are not limited to, immunoassay sand liquid chromatograph y/mass spectrometry . This approach could identify novel protein biomarkers that could aid in patient select ion for pembrolizumab therap y. Other blood-derived biomarkers: In addition to expression on the tumor tissue, PD-L1 and other tumor-derived proteins can be shed from tumor and released into the blood. Assays such as enzyme-linked immunoassay measure such proteins in serum. Correlation of expression with response to pembrolizumab therapymay identify new approaches for predictive biomarkers in blood,representing a major advance from today’s reliance on assessing tumor biomarkers. This research would serve to develop such assays for future clinical use . Other exploratory biomarkers (eg,PD-1 expression, markers of T-cell phenotype) may also be evaluated. Note that exploratory biomarkers are not applicable for China. 05J432"

Details on preparation and administration of pembrolizumab are provided in the Pharmacy Manual. Preparation of cisplatin and 5-FU should follow the local product labeland administration should follow local standard procedures . The body surface area in m2 should be calculated per local guidance. Dose Modification If appropriate, the investigator may attribute each toxicity event to cisplatin, 5-FU, or pembrolizumab and use a stepwise dose reduction according to Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, and Table 7. For individual subjects requiring a dose modification, treatment for each new cycle may be delayed if the scheduled off-drug periods are not adequate to allow for recovery to Grade ≤1 or the baseline status of the subject (with the exception of alopecia) . Pembrolizumab/placebo dose reductions are not permitted. Pembrolizumab/placebo treatment may be interrupted or discontinued due to toxicity(see Section 5.8.1 – Discontinuation of Treatment) . If a dose reduction for toxicity occurs with any agent, the dose may not be re-escalated. Subjects can have a maximum of 2dose modifications (if applicable) to each of the components of study therapy throughout the course of the study for toxicities. If a subject experiences several toxicities and there are conflicting recommendations, follow the most conservative dose adjustment recommended (i.e., dose reduction appropriate to the most severe toxicity). Subjects who require a thirddose modification to any particular component will have that agent discontinued. Reduction of one chemotherap y agent and not the other agent is appropriate if, in the opinion of the investigator, the toxicity is clearly related to one of the treatments. If, in the opinion of the investigator, the toxicity is related to the combination of both chemotherap y agents, both drugs should be reduced according to recommended dose modifications .If the toxicity is related to the combination of 3agents, chemotherap y should be reduced, interrupted, or discontinued, and pembrolizumab/placebo should be interrupted or discontinued according to the recommended dose modifications. TheCTCAE v4.0mustbe used to grade the severity of AEs. All dose modifications should be based on the AE requiring the greatest dose modification. Dosemodifications are detailed in Table 3, Table 4, Table 5,Table 6, and Table 7. Exceptional circumstances to following the dose modification tables below may be considered after consultation with the Sponsor. 05J432"

These immune -related AEs (irAEs) may occur shortly after the first dose or several months after the last dose of pembrolizumab treatment and may affect more than one body system simultaneously . Therefore, early recognition and initiation of treatment is critical to reduce complications. Based on existing clinical trial data, most irAEs were reversible and could be managed with interruptions of pembrolizumab, administration of corticosteroids, and/or other supportive care.For suspected irAEs, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm etiology or exclude other causes. Additional procedures or tests such as bronchoscopy , endoscop y,or skin biopsy may be included as part of the evaluation. Based on the severity of irAEs, withhold or permanentl y discontinue pembrolizumab and administer corticosteroids. Dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for irAEs associated with pembrolizumab are provided in Table 4. 05J432"

Clinically significant abnormal findings should be recorded in themedical history. Additional time points may be performed as clinically necessary . Tumor Imaging and Assessment of Disease The process for image collection and transmission to the central imaging vendor can be found in the Site Imaging Manual. Tumor imaging is strongly preferred tobe acquired by CT.Magnetic resonance imaging should be used only when CT is contraindicated or for imaging ofthe brain.The same imaging technique regarding modality and the use of contrast should be used in a subject throughout the trial to optimize the visualization of existing and new tumor b urden. Subject eligibility will be determined using local assessment (investigator assessment) based on RECIST 1.1. Although RECI ST 1.1 references a maximum of 5 target lesions in total and 2 per organ, the Sponsor allows a maximum of 10 target lesions in total and 5 per organ. All scheduled images for all trial subjects from the sites will be submitted to the central imaging vendor. In addition, images (including via other modalities) that are obtained at an unscheduled time point to determine PD, as well as imaging obtained for other reasons, but captures radiologic progr ession, should also be submitted to the central imaging vendor. The central imaging vendor will verify PD following the first radiologic evidence of PD (based on local investigator assessment). Expedited verification of radiologic PD by the central imaging vendor will be communicated to the trial site and Sponsor (see Section7.1.2.5.2 –Tumor Imaging During the Trial ). 7.1.2.5.1 Initial Tumor Imaging Initial tumor imaging at Screening must be performed within 21days prior to the date of randomization. The site trial team must review screening images to confirm the subject has measurable disease per RECI ST 1.1. The screening images must be submitted to the central imaging vendor for retrospective review. Scans performed as part of routine clinical management are acceptable for use as screening tumor imaging if they are of diagnostic quality and performed within 21days prior to the date of randomization and can be assessed by the central imaging vendor.At sites where the local regulatory body and/or IRB/ERC will not permit a second tumor imaging within a 21-day period, an already available imaging scan obtained within 28 days prior to first dose may be used with the approval of the Sponsor Clinical Director. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they have stable brain metastases (ie, without evidence of progression by imaging as confirmed by MRI if MRI was used at prior imaging or confirmed by CT imaging if CT was used at prior imaging for at least 4 weeks prior to the first dose of trial treatment ). Any neurologic sy mptoms must have returned to baseline and subjects must have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases and have not used steroids for brain metastases for at least 14days prior to trial 05J432"

This exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis, as subjects with carcinomatous meningitis are excluded regardless of clinical stability. 7.1.2.5.2 Tumor Imaging During the Trial The first on-trial imaging assessment should be performed at 9weeks (63days ± 7 days) from the date of randomization. Subsequent tumor imaging should be performed every 9weeks (63days ±7 days) or more frequently if clinically indicated. Imaging timing should follow calendar days and should not be adjusted for delays in cycle starts. Imaging should continue to be performed until PD isverified by the central imaging vendor(unless the site principalinvestigator elects to continue treatment and follow irRECIST), the start of new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, or death, whichever occurs first. All supplemental imaging must be submitted to the central imaging vendor. Per RECIST 1.1, partial response (PR)and CR should be confirmed by a repeat tumor imaging assessment obtained 4 weeks or longer from the date the response was first documented. The tumor imaging performed to confirm a response may be performed, at the earliest, 4 weeks after the first indication of a response, or at the next scheduled scan [i.e., 9weeks later(63 days ± 7 days)], whichever is clinically indicated. Subjects will then return to regular scheduled imaging every 9weeks(63 days ± 7 days), starting with the next scheduled imaging time point. Subjects who obtain a confirmation scan do not need to undergo the next scheduled tumor imaging if it is less than 4 weeks later; tumor imaging may resume at the subsequent scheduled imaging time point. Per irRECIST, PDshould be confirmed by the site at least 4 weeks after central verification ofsite-assessed first radiologic evidence of PD in clinically stable subjects. Subjects who have unconfirmed PDmay continue on treatment at the discretion of the site investigator until progression is confirmed by the site as long as they have met the conditions detailed in Section 7.1.2.5. 5 –irRECIST Assessment of Disease. Subjects who obtain a confirmation scan do not need to undergo the next scheduled tumor imaging if it is less than 4 weeks la ter; tumor imaging may resume at the subsequent scheduled imaging time point if clinically stable. Subjects who have confirmed PD, as assessed by the site, will discontinue trial treatment. Exceptions are detailed in Section 7.1.2.5. 5 –irRECIST Assessme nt of Disease . 7.1.2.5.3 End of Treatment and Follow -up Tumor Imaging In subjects who discontinue trial treatment, tumor imaging should be performed at the time of treatment discontinuation (±4 week window). If a previous scan was obtained within 4weeks prior to the date of discontinuation, then a scan at treatment discontinuation is not mandatory . In subjects who discontinue trial treatment due to documented PD, this is the final required tumor imaging. In subjects who discontinue trial treatment without documented PD, every effort should be made to continue monitoring their disease status by tumor imaging using the same imaging schedule used while on treatment [every 9 weeks (63 days ± 7 days)]to monitor disease status until the start of a new anticancer treatment, PD, death, or the end of the trial, whichever occurs first. 05J432"

Initial tumor imaging showing site-assessed PD should be submitted to the central imaging vendor immediatel y. The site will be notified if the central imaging vendor verifies PD using RECI ST 1.1. Figure 2illustrates the imaging flow involving verification of PD for clinically stable subjects. 7.1.2.5.5 irRECIST Assessment of Disease Immune-related RECIST is RECIST 1.1 adapted as described below to account for the unique tumor respo nse seen with immunotherapeutic drugs. Immune-related RECIST will be used by the site investigator/local radiology reviewers to assess tumor response and progression, and make treatment decisions. This data will be collected in the clinical database. When feasible, subjects should not be discontinued until progression is confirmed by the local site investigator/radiology assessment. This allowance to continue treatment despite initial radiologic PD takes into account the observation that some subjects can have a transient tumor flare in the first few months after the start of immunotherap y, and then experience subsequent disease response. Subjects that are deemed clinically unstable are not required to have repeat tumor imaging for confirmation of PD. Tumor flare includes any of the following scenarios: Worsening of existing target lesion(s) Worsening of existing non- target lesion(s) Development of new lesion(s) In subjects who have shown initial evidence of radiological PD by RECIST 1.1 as verified by the central imaging vendor, it is at the discretion of the principal investigator whether to continue a subject on trial medication until repeat imaging is obtained (using irRECIST for subject manageme nt (see Table 8andFigure 2). This clinical judgment decision by the site investigator should be based on the subject’s overall clinical condition, including performance status, clinical symptoms, and laboratory data. Subjects may receive trial medication and the tumor assessment should be repeated ≥ 4 weeks later in order to confirm PD by irRECIST per site assessment. Clinical stability is defined as the following: Absence of symptoms and signs indicating clinically significant progression of disease, including worsening of laboratory values No decline in ECOG performance status Absence of rapid progression of disease Absence of progressive tumor at critical anatomical sites (eg, cord compression) requiring urgent alte rnative medical intervention ) 05J432"

In determining whether or not the tumor burden has increased or decreased per irRECIST, the local site investigator should consider all target and non-target lesions, as well as any incremental new lesion(s). Disease progression will be considered to be “not confirmed” at repeat imaging if ALL of the following occur (as assessed by irRECIST): Target lesion sum of diameters is <20% or < 5 mm absolute increase compared to nadir Non-target disease resulting in initial PD is stable or qualitatively improved New lesion resulting in initial PD is stable or qualitatively improved No incremental new lesion(s) since last evaluation No incremental new non -target lesion progression since last evaluation If repeat imaging does not confirm PD per irRECIST as assessed by the local site investigator and the subject continues to be clinically stable, treatment may continue and follow the regular imaging schedule. Disease progression will be considered to be “confirmed” at repeat imaging if ANY of the following occur (as assessed by irRECIST): Target lesion sum of diameters remains ≥20% and at least 5 mm absolute increase compared to nadir Non-target disease resulting in initial PD is qualitatively worse New lesion resulting in initial PD is qualitatively worse Additional new lesion(s) since last evaluation Additional new non -target lesion progression since last evaluation If repeat imaging confirms PD due to any of the scenarios listed above, subjects will be discontinued from trial therap y. NOTE: If a subject has confirmed radiographic progression (i.e., 2 scans at least 4 weeks apart demonstrating PD) per irRECIST, but the subject is achieving a clinically meaningful benefit, and there is no further increase in the tumor burden at the confirmatory tumor imaging, an exception to continue treatment may be considered following consultation with the Sponsor. In this case, if treatment is continued, tumor imaging should continue to be performed following the intervals as outlined in Section 6.0 – Trial Flow Chartand be submitted to the central imaging vendor.

Documentation of equipment calibration must be retained as source documentation at the trialsite. Laboratory equipment –as required for inclusion labs and trial assessments Imaging equipment – as required for stud y objectives See protocol-specified guidance in the Administrative Binder, Procedures Manual, and Site Imaging Manual. Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics All-cause hospitalizations and emergency room visits must be reported in the eCRF, from the time of treatment allocation/randomization through 90 days following cessation of study treatment, or 30 days following cessation of study treatment, if the subjectinitiates new anticancer therap y, whichever is earlier. Visit Requirements Visit requirements are outlined in Section 6.0-Trial Flow Chart. Specific procedure -related details are provided above in Section 7.1 - Trial Procedures. Screening Visit Within 28days prior to treatment randomization, potential subjects will be evaluated to determine that they fulfill the entry requirements as set forth in Section 5.1–Entry Criteria. Visit requirements are outlined in the Section 6 – Trial Flow Chart. Screening procedures may be repeated. Written consent must be obtained prior to performing any protocol-specific procedure. Results of a test performed prior to the subject signing consent as part of routine clinical management are acceptable in lieu of a screening test if performed within the specified time frame. Screening procedures are to be completed within 28 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment except for the follow ing: Laboratory tests are to be performed within 14 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.

Post-Treatment Visits 7.1.6.3.1 Safety Follow -up Visit The mandatory Safety Follow-up Visit should be conducted approximately 30 days after the last dose of trial treatment or before the initiation of a new anticancer treatment, whichever comes first. 7.1.6.3.2 Follow-up Visits Subjects who discontinue trial treatment for a reason other than PDwill move into the Follow-up Phase and should be assessed by radiologic evaluation every 9weeks (63 days ± 7days) to monitor disease status. Every effort should be made to collect information regarding disease status until the start of new anticancer therapy, PD, death, or end of trial. Information regarding post-trial anticancer treatment will be collected ifnew treatment is initiated. 7.1.6.3.3 Survival Follow -up Subjects who experience confirmed PDor start a new anticancer therapy will move into the Survival Follow-up Phase and should be contacted by telephone approximately every 12weeks (84 days ± 7days) to assess for survival status until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the trial, whichever occurs first. Survival Status To ensure current and complete survival data is available at the time of database locks, updated survival status may be requested during the course of the study by the Sponsor. For example, updated survival status may be requested prior to,but not limited to,an external DMCreview, interim and/or final analysis.

Assessing and Recording Adverse Events An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocol- specified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol- specified procedure. Any worsening (i.e., any clinically significant adverse change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor’s produ ct, is also an adverse event. Changes resulting from normal growth and development that do not vary significantl y in frequency or severity from expected levels are not to be considered adverse events. Examples of this may include, but are not limited to, teething, typical crying in infants and children and onset of menses or menopause occurring at a ph ysiologically appropriate time. Sponsor's product includes any pharmaceutical product, biological product, device, diagnostic agent or protocol-specified procedure, whether investigational (including placebo or active comparator medication) or marketed, manufactured by, licensed by, provided by or distributed by the Sponsor for human use. Adverse events may occur during clinical trials, or as prescribed in clinical practice, from overdose (whether accidental or intentional), from abuse and from withdrawal. Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event. All adverse events that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment allocation/ randomization must be reported by the investigator if they cause the subject to be excluded from the trial, or are the result of a protocol-specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. From the time of treatment allocation/randomization through 30days following cessation of treatment, all adverse events must be reported by the investigator. Such events will be recorded at each examination on the AdverseEvent case report forms/worksheets. The reporting timeframe for adverse events meeting any serious criteria is described in section 7.2.3.1. The investigator will make every attempt to follow all subjects with non- serious adverse events for outcome. Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the Electronic Data Capture (EDC)data entry guidelines. Paper reporting procedures can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent). Adverse events will not be collected for subjects during thepre-screening period (for determination of archival tissue status) as long as that subject has not undergone any protocol-specified procedure or intervention. If the subject requires a blood draw, fresh 05J432"

Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the Sponsor For purposes of this trial, an overdose will be defined as any dose exceeding the prescribed dose for cisplatin or5-FU by ≥20% and as ≥1000 mg (5 times the dose) of pembrolizumab in a 3-weekperiod. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab . In the event of overdose, study treatment should be discontinued and the subject should be observed closely for signs of toxicity. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. If an adverse event(s) is associated with (“results from”) the overdose o f Sponsor's product or vaccine, the adverse event(s) is reported as a serious adverse event, even if no other seriousness criteria are met. If a dose of Sponsor's product or vaccine meeting the protocol definition of overdose is taken without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, the overdose is reported as a non-serious Event of Clinical Interest (ECI), using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” All reports of overdose with and without an adverse event must be reported by the investigator within 24 hours to the Sponsor either by electronic media or paper. Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines. Paper reporting procedures can be found in the I nvestigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent) . Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to the Sponsor Although pregnancy and lactation are not considered adverse events, it is the responsibility of investigators or their designees to report any pregnancy or lactation ina subject (spontaneousl y reported to them) that occurs during the trial. Pregnancies and lactations that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment allocation/ randomization must be reported by the investigator if they cause the subject tobe excluded from the trial, or are the result of a protocol-specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therapy, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. Pregnancies and lactations that occur from the time of treatment allocation/ randomization through 120days following cessation of Sponsor’s product,or 30 days following cessation of trial treatment ifthe subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, must be reported by the investigator. All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy . Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported. 05J432"

Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines. Paper reporting procedures can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent). Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events to the Sponsor Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of Sponsor's product that: ●Results in death; ●Is life threatening; ●Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity ; ●Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization; ●Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect; ●Is an other important medical event. Note:In addition to the above criteria, adverse events meeting either of the below criteria, although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Sponsor in the same timeframe as SAEs to meet certain local requirements. Therefore, these events are considered serious by the Sponsor for collection purposes. ●Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study); ●Is associated with an overdose. Refer toTable 10for additional details regarding each of the above criteria. For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment allocation/ randomization, any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, including death due to any causeother than progression of the cancer under study (reference Section 7.2.3.3 for additional details), that occurs to any subject must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor if it causes the subject to be excluded from the trial, or is the result of a protocol-specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therap y, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. For the time period beginning at treatment allocation/ randomization through 90days following cessation of trialtreatment, or 30 days following cessation of trial treatment if the subject initiates new anticancer therapy, whichever is earlier, any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event, including death due to any causeother than progression of the cancer under study (reference Section 7.2.3.3 for additional details), whether or not related to the Sponsor's product, must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor either by electronic media or paper. Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines. Paper reporting procedures can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or e quivalent).

Events of Clinical Interest Selected non-serious and serious adverse events are also known as Eve nts of Clinical I nterest (ECI) and must be reported to the Sponsor. For the time period beginning when the consent form is signed until treatment allocation/ randomization, any ECI, or follow up to an ECI , that occurs to any subject must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor if it causes the subject to be excluded from the trial, or is the result of a protocol-specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therap y, diet, placebo treatment or a procedure. For the time period beginning at treatment allocation/ randomization through 30days following cessation of treatment, any ECI, or follow up to an ECI, whether or not related to the Sponsor’s product, must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor, either by electronic media or paper. Electronic reporting procedures can be found in the EDC data entry guidelines. Paper reporting procedures can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent). Events of clinical interest for this trial include: 1. an overdose of Sponsor's product, as defined in Section 7.2.1 -Definition of an Overdose for This Protocol and Reporting of Overdose to the Sponsor, that is not associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results. 2. an elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory testing or un scheduled laboratory testing.* *Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional evaluation for an underl ying etiology. The trial site guidance for assessment and follow up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Trial File Binder (or equivalent). Protocol-SpecificExceptions to Serious Adverse Event Reporting Efficacy endpoints as outlined in this section will not be reported to the Sponsor as described in Section 7.2.3 –Immediate Reporting of Adverse Events .

Any suspected endpoint that, upon review,is not progression of the cancer under study will be forwarded to global safety as an SAE within 24hours of determination that the event is not progression of the cancer under study. Evaluating Adverse Events An investigator who is a qualified physician will evaluate all adverse events according to the NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Any adverse event which changes CTCAE grade over the course of a given episode will have each change of grade recorded on the a dverse event case report forms/worksheets. All adverse events regardless of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for seriousness. For studies in which multiple agents are administered as part of a combination regimen, the investigator may attribute each adverse event causality to the combination regimen or to a single agent of the combination. In general, causality attribution should be assigned to the combination regimen (i.e., to all agents in the regimen). However, causality attribution may be assigned to a single agent if in the investigator’s opinion, there is sufficient data to support full attribution of the adverse event to the single agent. 05J432"

Grade 2 Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental ADL. Grade 3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation or hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL. Grade 4 Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Grade 5 Death related to AE Seriousness A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of Sponsor’s product that: †Results in death ; or †Is life threatening; orplaces the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred (Note: This does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.); or †Results in a persiste nt or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions); or †Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization (hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay, even if the hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: Hospitalization for an elective procedure to treat a pre-existing condition that has not worsened is not a serious adverse event. A pre-existing condition is a clinical condition that is diagnosed prior to the use of a Merck product and is documented in the patient’s medical history.); or †Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in offspring of subject taking the product regardless of time to diagnosis);or Is anewcancer(that is not a condition of the study)(although not serious per ICH definition, is reportable to the Sponsor within 24 hours to meet certain local requirements); or Is an overdose (whether accidental or intentional). Any adverse event associated with an overdose is considered a serious adverse eventfor collection purposes. An overdose that is not associated with an adverse event is considered a non -serious event of clinical inter est and must be reported within 24 hours. Other important medical events that may not result in death, not be life threatening, or not require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse eve nt when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed previously (designated above by a †). Duration Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than 1 day, indicate the appropriate length of time and units Action taken Did the adverse event cause the Sponsor’s product to be discontinued? Relationship to Sponsor’s ProductDid the Sponsor’s product cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the Sponsor’s product caused the adverse event will be provided by an investigator who is a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test drug and the adverse event based upon the available information. The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the Sponsor’s product and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the Sponsor’s product caused the adverse event (AE): Exposure Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to the Sponsor’s product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pill count, diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen? Time Course Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the Sponsor’s product? Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to trials with investigational medicinal product)? Likely Cause Is the AE not reasonably explained by another etiology such as underlying disease, other drug(s)/vaccine(s), o r other host or environmental factors 05J432"

Any subject who receives the incorrect study medication for one cycle,but receives the correct treatment for all other cy cles,will be analy zed according to the correct treatment group and a narrative will be provided for any events that occur during the cycle for which the subject is incorrectl y dosed. At least 1laboratory or vital sign measurement obtained subsequent to at least 1dose of study treatment is required for inclusion in the analy sis of each specific parameter. To assess change from baseline, a baseline measurement is also required. Details on the approach to handling missing data for safety analyses are provided in Section8.6 –Statistical Methods. Statistical Methods Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses This section describes the statistical methods that address the primary and secondary objectives. Methods related to exploratory objectives will be described in the sSAP. Note that a sensitivity analysis for efficacy endpoints described in Sections 8.6.1.1 through 8.6.1.4 below will also be conducted for the Global Cohort (N=711). Efficacy results that will be deemed to be statistically significant after consideration of the Type-I error control strategy are described in Section 8.8–Multiplicity . Nominal p-values will be computed for other efficacy analyses but should be interpreted with caution due to potential issues of multiplicity . Progression-f ree Survival The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate the PFS rate over timein each treatment group. The hypotheses of treatment difference in PFS will be tested by the stratified log-rank test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron’s method of tie handling will be used to estimate the magnitude of the treatment difference (ie, hazard ratio [HR]) between the treatment arms. The HR and its 95% confidence interval (CI) from the stratified Cox model with Efron’s method of tie handling and with a single treatment covariate will be reported. The stratification factors used for randomization (see Section 5.4 –Stratification) will be applied to both the stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox model. Since disease progression is assessed per iodically, PDcan occur any time in the time interval between the last assessment where PD was not documented and the assessment when PD is documented. For the primary analysis, for the subjects who have PD, the true date of PD will be approximated by the date of the first assessment at which PD is objectively documented 05J432"

For the primary analysis, any subjectwho experiences an event (PD or death) immediatel y after 2 or more missed disease assessments will be censored at the last disease assessment prior to the missed visits. In addition, any subjectwho initiates new anti-cancer therapy will be censored at the last disease assessment prior to the initiation of new anti-cancer therapy. Subjectswho do not start new anti-cancer therapy and who do not experience an event will be censored at the last disease assessment. If a subjectmeets multiple criteria for censoring, the censoring criterion that occurs earliest will be applied. In order to evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint per RECIST 1.1 by investigator assessment , 2sensitivity analyses with different sets of censoring rules will be performed. The first sensitivity analysis follows the intention-to-treat principle. That is, PDs/deaths are counted as events regardless of missed study visits or initiation of new anti-cancer therapy. The second sensitivity analysis considers discontinuation of treatment due to reasons other than complete response or initiation of new anticancer treatment, whichever occurs later, to be a PD event for subjectswithout documented PD or death. If a subjectmeets multiple criteria for censoring, the censoring criterion that occurs earliest will be applied. The censoring rules for the primary and sensitivity analyses are summarized in Table 11. 05J432"

Membership in Tier 2 requires that at least 5% of participants in any treatment group exhibit the event; all other AEs and predefined limits of change will belong to Tier 3. The threshold of at least 5%of participants was chosen for Tier2 events because the population enrolled in this study is in critical condition and usually experiences various AEs of similar types regardless of treatment; events reported less frequently than 5%of participants would obscure the assessment of the overall safety profile and add little to the interpretation of potentially meaningful treatment differences. In addition, Grade3 to 5 AEs (≥5%of participants in 1 of the treatment groups) and SAEs ( ≥2%of participants in 1 of the treatment groups) will be considered Tier2 endpoints. Because many 95% CIs may be provided without adjustment for multiplicity , the CIs should be regarded as a helpful descriptive measure to be used in safety review, not as a formal method for assessing the statistical significance of the between -group differences. Safety endpoints that are not Tier 1 or 2 events are considered Tier 3 events. The broad AE categories consisting of the proportion of participants with any AE, a drug related AE, a serious AE, an AE which is both drug-related and serious, aGrade 3-5 AE, a drug-related Grade 3-5 AE, and discontinuation due to an AE will be considered Tier 3endpoints.

At the time of an analysis, the observed number of events may differ substantially from the expected. To avoid overspending at theinterim analysis and leave reasonable alpha for the final analysis, the minimum alpha spending strategy will be adopted. At the IA, the information fraction used in Lan-DeMets spending function to determine the alpha spending at the IA will be based on the minimum of the expected information fraction and the actual information f raction at each anal ysis. Specifically , In the scenario that the events accrue faster than expected and the observed number of events exceeds the expected number of events at a given anal ysis, then the information fraction will be calculated as the expect ed number of events at the interim analy sis over the target number of events at FA. The final analysis will use the remaining Type I error that has not been spent at the earlier analyses. The boundary calculation will be based on the correlation between IA and FA test statistics, which is determined by the actual number of events observed at IA and FA. Objective Response Rate The study will test ORR only once at the interim analysis (IA), at an α level of 0.025 if all OS and PFS hypotheses are rejected. Note that if superiority for allPFS and OS hypotheses is declared at a future planned analysis, then the test statistics previously computed at IA for the ORR hy pothesis will be used for inferential testing at an αlevel of 0.025. Based on the 749 randomized subjectswith at least 10 months of follow-up, power at α=0.025 as well as the approximate treatment difference required to reach the bound (ΔORR) are shown in Table 18, assuming underlying 35% and 50% response ratesin the control and experimental groups, respectivel y.

Sample Size and Power Calculations The sample size and power calculations for PFS and OS assume the fo llowing: PFS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 6 months for the control group. OS follows an exponential distribution with a median of 12 months for the control group. Enrollment period of 22 months An annual dropout rate of 5% for both PFS and OS The sample size and power calculations were performed using R (“gsDesign” package). Note, at the time of this amendment, the study enrollment has been completed. The study has enrolled749 subjectsin a 1:1 ratio into the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy and the placebo + chemotherap y arms. PFS and OS are primary endpoints for the study , with ORR as the key secondary endpoint. It is expected that the prevalence of ESCC with PD-L1 CPS ≥10 is 38%, PD-L1 CPS ≥10 is 5 1%(all subjects) , and ESCC is 73%. For the PFS endpoint, based on a target number of 460 investigator -assessed events in ESCC at IA (finalfor PFS), the study has approximately 82.8% power to detect an HR of 0.7 at an overall α level of 0.002 (1 -sided). In the scenario that the PFS hy pothesis is rejected in ESCC, the PFS test has 62.2% power to detect an HR of 0.7 at an α level of 0.002in subjectswith PD-L1 CPS ≥10. In the scenario that both of PFS hypotheses in ESCC and in PD-L1 CPS ≥10 are rejected, the PFS test has 76.8% power to detect an HR of 0.75at an α level of 0.002 in all subjects. In the scenario that the PFS null hypotheses in all population s and all OS null hypotheses are rejected, the PFS test has 95.1% power to detect an HR of 0.75 at an α level of 0.025 in all subjects.

The investigator must consult with and obtain written approval b y the Sponsor prior to destroying trial and/or subject files. ICH Good Clinical Practice guidelines recommend that the investigator inform the subject’s primary physician about the subject’s participation in the trial if the subject has a primary physician and if the subject agrees to the primary physician being informed. The investigator will promptly inform the Sponsor of any regulatory authority inspection conducted for this trial. Persons debarred from conducting or working on clinical trials by any court or regulatory authority will not be allowed to conduct or work on this Sponsor’s trials. The investigator will immediately disclose in writing to the Sponsor if any person who is involved in conducting the trial is debarred or if any proceeding for debarment is pending or, to the best of the investigator’s knowledge, threatened. In the event the Sponsor prematurel y terminates a particular trial site, the Sponsor will promptly notify that trial site’s I RB/IEC. According to European legislation, a Sponsor must designate an overall coordinating investigator for a multi-center trial (including multinational). When more than one trial site is open in an EU country, Merck, as the Sponsor, will designate, per country, a national principal coordinator (Protocol CI), responsible for coordinating the work of the principal investigators at the different trial sites in that Member State, according to national regulations. For a single-center trial, the Protocol CI is the principal investigator. In addition, the Sponsor must designate a principal or coordinating investigator to review the trial report that summarizes the trial results and confirm that, to the best of his/her knowledge, the report accuratel y describes the condu ct and results of the trial [Clinical Study Report (CSR) CI]. The Sponsor may consider one or more factors in the selection of the individual to serve as the Protocol CI and or CSR CI (e.g., availabilit y of the Protocol/CSR CI during the anticipated review process, thorough understanding of clinical trial methods, appropriate enrollment of subject cohort, timely achievement of trial milestones). The Protocol CI must be a participating trial investigator.

Introduction A. Purpose Merck, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing and reporting these trials in compliance with the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of subject safety is the overriding concern in the design of clinical trials. In all cases, Merck clinical trials will be conducted in compliance with local and/or national regulations and in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. B. Scope Such standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by Merck irrespective of the party (parties) employed for their execution (e. g., contract research organizations, collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials which are observational in nature, or which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator -initiated trials which are n ot under the control of Merck. II.Scientific Issues A. Trial Conduct 1.Trial Design Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis-driven to assess safety, efficacy and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices of Merck or comparator products. Alternatively, Merck may conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or trials to determine subject preferences, etc. The design (i.e., subject population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific purpose of the trial. Research subje cts must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial. 2.Site Selection Merck selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access to appropriate subjects, adequacy of facilities and staff, previous performance in Merck trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial initiation, sites are evaluated by Merck personnel to assess the ability to successfully conduct the trial. 3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity Trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and general principles of Good Clinical Practice. Merck reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness and consistency. Data are verified versus source documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per Merck policies and procedures, if fraud, misconduct or serious GCP-non-Compliance are suspected, the issues are promptly investigated. When necessary, the clinical site will be closed, the responsible regulatory authorities and ethics review committees notified and data disclosed a ccordingly. B. Publication and Authorship To the extent scientifically appropriate, Merck seeks to publish the results of trials it conducts. Some early phase or pilot trials are intended to be hypothesis -generating rather than hypothesis testing. In such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues of multiplicity. Merck’s policy on authorship is consistent with the requirements outlined in the ICH-Good Clinical Practice guidelines. In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and conduct of the trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. Merck funding of a trial will be acknowledged in publications. 05J432"
127,page_127,"Product: MK -3475 127 Protocol/Amendment No.: 590-09 MK-3475-590-09 FinalProtocol 17-Jun-2020 ConfidentialIII. Subject Protection A.IRB/ERC review All clinical trials willbe reviewed and approved by an independent IRB/ERC before being initiated at each site. Significant changes or revisions to the protocol will be approved by the IRB/ERC prior to implementation, except that changes required urgently to protect subject safety and well-being may be enacted in anticipation of IRB/ERC approval. For each site, the IRB/ERC and Merck will approve the subject informed consent form. B.Safety The guiding principle in decision-making in clinical trials is that subject welfare is ofprimary importance. Potential subjects will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At a minimum, trial designs will take into account the local standard of care. Subjects are never denied access to app ropriate medical care based on participation in a Merck clinical trial. All participation in Merck clinical trials is voluntary. Subjects are enrolled only after providing informed consent for participation. Subjects may withdraw from a Merck trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, or receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them. C.Confidentiality Merck is committed to safeguarding subject confidentiality, to the greatest extent possible. Unless required by law, only the investigator, Sponsor (or representative) and/or regulatory authorities will have access to confidential medical records that might identify the research subject by name. D.Genomic Research Genomic Research will only be conducted in accordance with informed consent and/or as specifically authorized by an Ethics Committee. IV.Financial Considerations A.Payments to Investigators Clinical trials are time-and labor-intensive. It is Merck’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of Merck trials. Merck does not pay incentives to enroll subjects in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments ma y be made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts. Merck does not pay for subject referrals. However, Merck may compensate referring physicians for time spent on chart review to identify potentially eligible subjects. B.Clinical Rese arch Funding Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by Merck, and that the investigator or sponsoring institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial. However, the local IRB/ERC may wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As noted above, publications resulting from Merck trials will indicate Merck as a source of funding. C.Funding for Travel and Other Requests Funding of travel by investigators and support staff (e.g.,to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be consistent with local guidelines and practices including, in the U.S., those established by the American Medical Association (AMA). V. Investigator Commi tment Investigators will be expected to review Merck’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the protocol, agree to support these ethical and scientific standards. * In this document, ""Merck"" refers to Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. and Schering Corporation, each of which is a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc.

A biomarker may be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease or condition.1 b.Pharmacogenomics: The investigation of variations of DNA and RNA characteristics as related to drug /vaccineresponse.2 c.Pharmacogenetics: A subset of pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenetics is the influence of variations in DNA sequence on drug /vaccineresponse.2 d.DNA: Deox yribonucleic acid. e.RNA: Ribonucleic acid. 2.Scope of Future Biomedical Research The specimens consented and/or collected in this trial as outlined in Section 7.1.3.6 – Future Biomedical Research Samples will be used in various experiments to understand: oThe biology of how drugs/vaccines work oBiomarkers responsible for how a drug/vaccine enters and is removed b y the body oOther pathways drugs/vaccines may interact with oThe biology of disease The specimen(s) may be used for future assay development and/or drug/vaccine development. It is now well recognized that information obtained from studying and testing clinical specimens offers unique opportunities to enhance our understanding of how individuals respond to drugs/vaccines, enhance our understanding of human disease and ultimately improve public health through development of novel treatments targeted to populations with the greatest need. All specimens will be used by the Sponsoror those working for or with the Sponsor . 3.Summary of Procedures for Future Biomedical Research a.Subjects for Enrollment All subjects enrolled in the clinical trial will be considered for enrollment in Future Biomedical Research. b.Informed Consent Informed consent for specimens (i.e., DNA, RNA, protein, etc.) will be obtained during screening for protocol enrollment from all subjects or legal guardians, at a trial visit by the investigator or his or her designate. Informed consent for Future Biomedical Research should be presented to the subjects on the visit designated in the trial flow chart. If delayed, present consent at next possible Subject Visit. Consent forms signed by the subject will be kept at the clinical trial site under secure storage for regulatory reasons. 05J432"

Any specimens for which such an informed consent cannot be verified will be destroy ed. d.Future Biomedical Research Specimen(s) Collection of specimens for Future Biomedical Research will be performed as outlined in the trial flow chart. In general, if additional blood specimens are being collected for Future Biomedical Research, these will usually be obtained at a time when the subject is having blood drawn for other trial purposes. 4. Confidential Subject Information for Future Biomedical Research In order to optimize the research that can be conducted with Future Biomedical Research specimens, it is critical to link subject' clinical information with future test results. In fact little or no research can be conducted without connecting the clinical trial data to the specimen. The clinical data allow specific analyses to be conducted. Knowing subject characteristics like gender, age, medical history and treatment outcomes are critical to understanding clinical context of analy tical results. To maintain privacy of information collected from specimens obtained for Future Biomedical Research, the Sponsorhas developed secure policies and procedures. All specimens will be single-coded per ICH E15 guidelines as described below . At the clinical trial site, unique codes will be placed on the Future Biomedical Research specimens. This code is a random number which does not contain any personally identifying information embedded within it. The link (or key) between subject identifiers and this unique code will be held at the trial site. No personal identifiers will appear on the specimen tube. 5.Biorepositor y Specimen Usage Specimens obtained for the Sponsor will be used for analyses using good scientific practices. Analyses utilizing the Future Biomedical Research specimens may be performed by the Sponsor, or an additional third party (e.g., a university investigator) designated by the Sponsor. The investigator conducting the analysis will follow the Sponsor’s privacy and confidentiality requirements. Any contracted third party analyses will conform to the specific scope of analysis outlined in future biomedical research protocol and consent. Future Biomedical Research specimens remaining with the third party after specific anal ysis is performed will be reported to the Sponsor . 6. Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research Subjects may withdraw their consent for Future Biomedical Research and ask that their biospecimens not be used for Future Biomedical Research. Subjects may withdraw consent at any time by contacting the principal investigator for the main trial. If medical records for the main trial are still available, the investigator will contact the Sponsor using the designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@merck.com). 05J432"
130,page_130,"Product: MK -3475 130 Protocol/Amendment No.: 590-09 MK-3475-590-09 FinalProtocol 17-Jun-2020 ConfidentialSubsequently , the subject's specimens will be flagged in the biorepository and restricted to main study use only. If specimens were collected from study participants specificall y for Future Biomedical Research, these specimens will be removed from the biorepository and destroyed. Documentation will be sent to the investigat or confirming withdrawal and/ordestruction, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the investigator to inform the subject of completion of the withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. Any analyses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal/destruction or already performed prior to the request being received by the Sponsor will continue to be used as part of the overall research trial data and results. No new analyses would be generated after the request is received. In the event that the medical records for the main trial are no longer available (e.g., if the investigator is no longer required by regulatory authorities to retain the main trial records) or the specimens have been completel y anonymized, there will no longer be a link between the subject’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for withdrawal of consent and/or destruction cannot be processed. 7. Retention of Specimens Future Biomedical Research specimens will be stored in the biorepository for potential analysis for up to 20 years from the end of the main study. Specimens may be stored for longer if a regulatory or governmental authority has active questions that are being answered. In this special circumstance, specimens will be stored until these questions have been adequatel y addressed. Specimens from the trial site will be shipped to a central laboratory and then shipped to the Sponsor-designated biorepository . If a central laboratory is not utilized in a particular trial, the trial site will ship directly to the Sponsor-designated bioreposit ory. The specimens will be stored under strict supervision in a limited access facility which operates to assure the integrity of the specimens. Specimens will be destroyed according to Sponsor policies and procedures and this destruction will be documented in the biorepository database. 8.Data Security Databases containing specimen information and test results are accessible only to the authorized Sponsor representatives and the designated trial administrator research personnel and/or collaborators. Database user authentication is highly secure, and is accomplished using network security policies and practices based on international standards to protect against unauthorized access. 9. Reporting of Future Biomedical Research Data to Subjects No information obtained from exploratory laboratory studies will be reported to the subject, family, or physicians. Principle reasons not to inform or return results to the subject include: Lack of relevance to subject health, limitations of predictive capability, and concerns regarding misinterpretation. If important research findings are discovered, the Sponsor may publish results, present results in national meetings, and make results accessible on a public website in order to rapidly report this informatio n to doctors and subjects. Subjects will not be identified by 05J432"

Future Biomedical Research Study Population Every effort will be made to recruit all subjects diagnosed and treated on Sponsorclinical trials for Future Biomedical Research . 11.Risks Versus Benefits of Future Biomedical Research For FBR, risks to the subject have been minimized. No additional risks to the subject have been identified as no additional specimens are being collected for FBR(i.e., only leftover samples are being retained). The Sponsor has developed strict security, policies and procedures to address subject data privacy concerns. Data privacy risks are largely limited to rare situations involving possible breach of confidentiality . In this highly unlikely situation there is risk that the information, like all medical information, may be misused. 12.Questions Any questions related to the future biomedical research should be e-mailed directly to clinical.specimen.management@merck.com. 13.References 1.
