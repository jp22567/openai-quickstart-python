Investigators: Investigator information on file at AbbVie. Study Sites: Approximately 125 sites Study Population: Patients with treatment-naïve AML who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy due to comorbidities. Number of Subjects to be Enrolled: Approximately 210 subjects Methodology: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter trial. Screening Unless otherwise specified, screening procedures must be performed within 21 days prior to randomization. Once screening procedures are complete and eligibility is confirmed, subjects will be randomized using a 2:1 ratio to one of the following two arms: •Arm A: Venetoclax plus LDAC •Arm B: Placebo plus LDAC Study Treatment All subjects in Arm A will receive venetoclax orally once daily (QD) plus LDAC (QD) beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1. Venetoclax should be taken within 30 minutes of food intake, preferably breakfast. Subjects will receive LDAC on Days 1 – 10 of each cycle. All subjects in Arm B will receive placebo orally (QD) plus LDAC (QD) beginning on Cycle 1 Day 1. Placebo should be taken within 30 minutes of food intake. Subjects will receive LDAC on Days 1 – 10 of each cycle. Cycle Length – 28 Days •Venetoclax 600 milligram (mg) or Placebo Daily on Days 1 – 28 •LDAC 20 mg/m 2Subcutaneous (SC) Daily on Days 1 – 10"
5,page_5,"Venetoclax (ABT-199) M16-043 Protocol Amendment 5 EudraCT 2016-003900-30 6 Methodology (Continued): Subjects will continue their treatment assignment until documented disease progression per Investigator Assessment, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or the subject meets other protocol criteria for discontinuation (whichever occurs first). Accordingly, subjects may, in rare occasions, continue treatment after documented disease progression if the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the patient. All subjects will have a Final Visit performed when treatment is discontinued unless the subject has withdrawn consent to participate in the study. Baseline laboratory assessments will be obtained at Cycle 1 Day 1 prior to first dose of study treatment. PRO measures should generally be completed prior to other procedures, clinical assessments, and the administration of study treatment; however, they may be administered following confirmation that the subject is able to receive study treatment at the visit. Disease assessments by IWG criteria will be performed at end of Cycle 1 (± 3 days). Subjects with resistant disease at the end of Cycle 1 will repeat assessment at the end of Cycle 2 or Cycle 3 based on the hematologic recovery to confirm a suspected response, and every 3 cycles thereafter starting at the end of Cycle 4 and continuing until disease progression per the modified IWG criteria until 2 successive disease assessments result in CR or CRi, or the subject withdraws consent. For subjects achieving 2 successive disease assessments that result in CR or CRi, disease assessments consist of laboratory and physical examination, bone marrow evaluation required upon concern for relapse. For subjects with a response of CRi a repeat bone marrow aspirate must be performed to confirm a CR once peripheral blood count recovery is noted. Disease assessments should also occur at the Final Visit and any other time the patient features suggest relapse or progressive disease. For subjects who are unblinded following the final analysis results, bone marrow collection every 3 cycles starting at the end of Cycle 4 and bone marrow collection after CRi to confirm CR are not required. Bone marrow collection until 2 successive disease assessments resulting in CR or CRi is not required. Bone marrow collection can be completed as per institutional standard of care. In addition to being reviewed by the Investigator and local hematopathologists, all disease assessment information will be sent to an Independent Review Committee (IRC) to provide response assessment. Interpretations from the IRC will not be shared with sites. Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion: Main Inclusion: A subject will be eligible for study participation if he/she meets the following criteria within 21 days prior to randomization (bone marrow samples and peripheral blasts used for AML diagnosis can be collected within 30 days prior to randomization). 1.

9,page_9,"Venetoclax (ABT-199) M16-043 Protocol Amendment 5 EudraCT 2016-003900-30 10 Criteria for Evaluation: Efficacy: Bone marrow biopsies and aspirates must be performed at screening for all subjects. Cytogenetic assessment will be done at a local lab during screening. Samples for molecular markers and baseline disease assessment for potential MRD evaluation must be collected at screening. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must be performed at the end of Cycle 1. For all subjects a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must be performed at end of Cycle 4 and every 3 cycles (± 1 week) thereafter, however, these collections are not required for subjects who are unblinded following the final analysis results. Bone marrow collection can be completed as per institutional standard of care. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should also be performed upon concern for relapse or progressive disease and at the Final Visit (if no bone marrow was collected within the last 6 – 8 weeks, or if relapse or progression of disease has already been confirmed). Bone marrow will be obtained until two successive samples indicate CR or CRi, however, these collections are not required for subjects who are unblinded following the final analysis results. For subjects achieving 2 successive disease assessments that result in CR or CRi, disease assessments consist of laboratory and physical examination, bone marrow evaluation required upon concern for relapse. For subjects with a response of CRi on two successive bone marrow samples an additional bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must be performed to confirm a CR once peripheral blood count recovery is noted, however, these collections are not required for subjects who are unblinded following the final analysis results. Subjects will be assessed for response rate according to modified IWG criteria for AML (Cheson et al J Clin Oncol 2003). Progressive disease is defined per European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations. If additional treatments are needed to optimize subjects' medical care, they can be performed following institutional standards and procedures. Subject's disease assessment is based on the most recent physical examination, bone marrow results and recent hematology values. For subjects who require a delay in the next cycle of study treatment for blood count recovery after a bone marrow evaluation, hematology values up to pre-dose labs from Day 1 of the next cycle or 2 weeks from the bone marrow if there is no additional dosing can be used to determine the IWG response. All subjects who complete at least one cycle of study treatment will be assessed by the investigators using the modified IWG criteria for AML as described below. Subjects who discontinue study treatment prior to completion of Cycle 1 will be deemed non-evaluable for response assessment."

24,page_24,"Venetoclax (ABT-199) M16-043 Protocol Amendment 5 EudraCT 2016-003900-30 25 3.0 Introduction Venetoclax Activity and Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Profile Hematologic malignancies are highly dependent upon the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 for survival. Over-expression of BCL-2 is associated with tumor initiation, disease progression, and drug resistance, and is thus a compelling target for anti-tumor therapy. Venetoclax is a potent, selective and orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of BCL-2 that binds with > 1,000-fold higher affinity for BCL-2 (K i< 0.010 nM) than for BCL-X L(Ki= 48 nm) or MCL-1 (K i> 444 nM).1 In vitro, venetoclax has demonstrated cell killing activity against patient-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells and a variety of lymphoma and leukemia cell lines, including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). 1 BCL-2 over-expression has also been implicated in the maintenance and survival of AML cells and has been associated with resistance to chemotherapeutics. In addition, high levels of BCL-2 were associated with poor survival in a subset of patients with this disease. 2,3 The BCL-2/BCL-X Linhibitor ABT-737 has been shown to kill AML cells, including leukemic stem/progenitor cells, as both a single agent and in combination with cytarabine 2or 5-azacitidine.3 To further define the role of BCL-2 in this disease, panels of AML cell lines and primary patient samples were cultured in the presence of venetoclax. Twelve of 24 AML cell lines tested were sensitive to venetoclax, with cell killing IC 50values of < 1.0 μ M (Appendix H ). The sensitivity of primary AML subject samples was comparable to that observed for primary CLL samples, with a medianIC 50= 0.010 μ M (n = 57) for AML4(Appendix H ) Venetoclax has also demonstrated killing of AML leukemic stem/progenitor cells ex vivo and antitumor efficacy in vivo, inhibiting the growth of AML cell lines or AML patient-derived primary cells systemically engrafted into immunocompromised mice. 4 Single agent venetoclax has been studied in relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML and was found to induce rapid reduction in blast counts in some patients indicating activity in subject with this disease. However, not all AML cell lines, primary patient samples, or subjects treated with single"
25,page_25,"Venetoclax (ABT-199) M16-043 Protocol Amendment 5 EudraCT 2016-003900-30 26 agent venetoclax were found to be sensitive, and there is biologic rationale for combining venetoclax with certain chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of AML. The MCL-1 protein can act as a resistance factor for Bcl-2 family inhibitors 5,6including in AML.2 Therapeutic agents such as the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor azacitidine,3the DNA synthesis inhibitor cytarabine7and the anthracycline doxorubicin8have shown an ability to down-regulate MCL-1, indicating that they might combine well with BCL-2 inhibitors. In support of this, ABT-737 has demonstrated synergistic killing of AML cell lines when combined with cytarabine or doxorubicin. 2 Likewise, the combination of ABT-737 and azacitidine demonstrated synergistic killing of 7 of 8 primary AML patient samples and completely inhibited the engraftment of human CD45 + AML cells into immunocompromised mice. 3 Combinations of venetoclax and chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in the treatment of AML were recently tested against a panel of 20 AML cell lines. While most combinations resulted in additive cell killing, venetoclax combined with cytarabine or azacitidine showed synergistic effects on several AML cell lines (Appendix H ). These data suggest that BCL-2 inhibition alone may be sufficient for the synergistic effects that have been observed between ABT-737 and cytarabine or azacitidine, and thus provides a rationale for testing these combinations with venetoclax in subjects with AML. . Based on in vitro results, venetoclax was a P-gp, BCRP, and OATP1B1 inhibitor. It was not a potent in vitro inhibitor of CYP3A4, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP2D6 (IC 50> 30 μ M); and it did not induce CYP3A4 or CYP1A2 at concentrations up to 10 μM."
26,page_26,"Venetoclax (ABT-199) M16-043 Protocol Amendment 5 EudraCT 2016-003900-30 27 Venetoclax Preclinical Toxicology A detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, and pharmacology can be found in the current Investigator's Brochure.9 Acute Myeloid Leukemia Acute myeloid leukemia is characterized by the clonal expansion of myeloid blasts in the bone marrow, peripheral blood and extramedullary tissues which disrupts normal haematopoiesis. It is a heterogeneous disease, encompassing a large number of distinctly different subtypes that may have different clinical presentations and differing responses to treatment. AML is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a myeloid neoplasm with 20% or more blasts in the peripheral blood or bone marrow. 10 It is the most common form of acute leukemia in adults with an estimated 19,950 new cases and 10,430 deaths in 2016 in the United States. 11 The incidence is approximately 36,000 in the US alone. The median age of diagnosis is 67 years, with 55% of the patients diagnosed at 65 years or older, and approximately a third of them are diagnosed over the age of 75. For many patients with AML, initial treatment recommendations are a function of the patient's ability to receive and benefit from anthracycline-containing induction chemotherapy. Most younger adults diagnosed with AML are considered fit enough to receive an anthracycline-containing induction chemotherapy regimen. For fit patents, standard treatment for newly diagnosed AML consists of remission induction therapy with cytarabine and an anthracycline, usually daunorubicin or idarubicin (7 + 3), followed by consolidation therapy. Though some older patients receive anthracycline-containing induction chemotherapy, most older patients do not receive intensive induction chemotherapy but rather receive less-intensive therapy such as LDAC or a hypomethylating therapy. Indeed, AML in older patients is often a biologically and clinically distinct disease with a diminished response to chemotherapy, low remission rates, and short disease-free/overall survival. In older patients higher proportions of unfavorable cytogenetics, higher frequency of"
27,page_27,"Venetoclax (ABT-199) M16-043 Protocol Amendment 5 EudraCT 2016-003900-30 28 antecedent hematologic disorders or prior therapy for previous malignancies, and more frequent expression of the multidrug resistance phenotype contribute to the poor outcomes associated with current therapy. Additionally, the presence and severity of comorbid conditions, compromised end organ function that enhance the toxicity of induction chemotherapy, and functional incapacity all decrease the ability for the elderly patient to tolerate induction chemotherapy often associated with AML therapy. Though less common than for older patients, some younger patients may also be unfit to receive anthracycline-containing chemotherapy for reasons such as severe cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or other comorbidities. Several studies have also demonstrated the benefits of active therapy over supportive care only, with respect to survival and quality of life, suggesting that treatment should be offered to nearly all patients diagnosed with AML. Venetoclax Clinical Data Based on the mechanism of action and nonclinical and clinical data available to date, the safety profile of venetoclax is well described. The most common adverse drug reactions across all indications are nausea, diarrhea, hematological effects, and serious and/or opportunistic infections. Hematologic effects include neutropenia/febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, and lymphopenia. Upper respiratory tract infections areamong the most common infections. TLS is an important identified risk and is predominantly seen in the CLL population with high tumor burden. Based on pre-clinical data, decreased spermatogenesis has been identified as a potential risk for venetoclax."
28,page_28,"Venetoclax (ABT-199) M16-043 Protocol Amendment 5 EudraCT 2016-003900-30 29 Clinical Data in AML As of 09 March 2016 a total of 102 subjects with AML have been treated in the venetoclax oncology clinical program: 32 subjects with R/R and in unfit AML received venetoclax as a single agent (Study M14-212) and 70 subjects received venetoclax in combination with other therapeutic agents including 45 subjects with HMAs (Study M14-358) and 25 subjects with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) (Study M14-387). To date, the adverse events observed occurred at an incidence that appeared to be consistent with what would be expected in the AML patients both in monotherapy and combination studies. Neutropenia is being closely monitored. Overview of Phase 2 Study M14-212: Venetoclax Monotherapy in AML This is a completed study with single agent venetoclax in subjects with R/R AML and those unfit for intensive therapy. A total of 32 subjects were dosed. Exposure, safety, and efficacy data are available for this study. 12 The most common adverse events observed in ≥ 30% of the subjects in Study M14-212 were nausea (59.4%); diarrhea (56.3%); hypokalemia, vomiting (40.6% each); fatigue, headache (34.4% each); hypomagnesemia (37.5%); febrile neutropenia (31.3%); abdominal pain, cough, hypophosphatemia (28.1% each); epistaxis, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, malignant neoplasm progression (25.0% each); dyspnea, hypotension, peripheral edema, pyrexia, and pneumonia (21.9% each). Serious adverse events were reported in 27 subjects (84.4%), the most common being febrile neutropenia (28.1%), malignant neoplasm progression (25.0%), and pneumonia (15.6%). Three serious adverse events were considered to have a reasonable possibility of being related to venetoclax (i.e., one event each of diarrhea, febrile neutropenia, and pseudomonal bacteremia). No cases of TLS occurred during venetoclax treatment. Efficacy data for Study M14-212 are available for all 32 subjects, the majority (30, 94%) of the subjects had R/R AML and a few (2, 6%) were deemed unfit for intensive therapy. The ORR was 19% (6 of 32 subjects), with complete remission (CR) in 2 (6%) and complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) in 4 (13%) subjects."

Overview of Ongoing Phase 1b Study (Study M14-358): Venetoclax in Combination with HMA in Treatment Naïve AML As of 09 March 2016, a total of 45 subjects ≥ 65 years of age with treatment naïve AML ineligible to receive standard induction therapy were enrolled into the escalation stage at three dose levels of venetoclax at 400 mg, 800 mg, and 1200 mg. Venetoclax was administered daily during the 28-day cycles in combination with decitabine (20 mg/m 2 intravenously on Days 1 – 5 once every 28 days) or azacitidine (75 mg/m2intravenously or subcutaneously on Days 1 – 7 once every 28 days). Preliminary safety and efficacy data are available from the ongoing dose escalation stage of this trial. The most common adverse events for all subjects in Study M14-358 were nausea (53.3%), diarrhea (44.4%), febrile neutropenia (40.0%), neutrophil count decreased (31.1%), platelet count decreased, cough, and fatigue (28.9% each), edema peripheral and hypokalemia (26.7% each). Events grade 3 and above were reported for the majority (91.1%) of subjects; the most common event was febrile neutropenia (40.0%). Serious adverse events were reported for 27 (60.0%) subjects, including febrile neutropenia (11 subjects), malignant neoplasm progression (3 subjects) atrial fibrillation, abdominal pain, non-cardiac chest pain, pyrexia, pneumonia, sepsis, bone pain (2 subjects each). All other events occurred in one subject each. The combination of venetoclax with decitabine and azacitidine demonstrates a tolerable safety profile. As of 09 March 2016, the ORR, as assessed by the investigators for the subjects enrolled into the three dose levels, was 62.2% (28 of 45), with CR in 12 (26.7%), CRi in 15 (33.3%), and PR in one (2.2%). Four subjects (8.9%) were reported to have morphologic leukemia-free state (less than 5% blasts in bone marrow aspirate sample with at least 200 nucleated cells) after completion of Cycle 1. Eight patients (17.8%) had resistant disease. However, all of the patients with resistant disease had evidence of blast"

The patients enrolled into the 1200 mg dose level had a shorter follow-up at the time of this analysis. The maximum tolerated dose has not been reached in either arm and dose escalation stage has completed enrollment. Enrollment into safety expansion at 400 mg and 800 mg dose of venetoclax in combination with both HMAs is ongoing. Overview of Ongoing Phase 1/2 Study M14-387: Venetoclax in Combination with Low Dose Cytarabine in Treatment Naïve AML As of 28 November 2015, a total of 25 subjects ≥ 65 years of age with treatment naïve AML ineligible to receive standard induction therapy were enrolled; 18 subjects were enrolled into the Phase 1 portion of the study and a RPTD of 600 mg has been identified. Enrollment into the subsequent Phase 2 portion with approximately 50 subjects is ongoing to evaluate the RPTD for efficacy and safety. Preliminary efficacy data for Study M14-387 are available for 18 subjects with AML without a prior MPN treated with a 600 mg venentoclax target dose and LDAC as of 31 March 2016 (ASH abstract 2016). The CR + CRi rate was 78%. Of the 25 subjects enrolled across all doses at the 28 November 2015 data cut, the most common adverse events were nausea (68.0%), anemia (52.0%), and febrile neutropenia (36.0%). Events grade 3 and above were reported for all but one subject (96.0%); the most common event was anemia (48.0%). Serious adverse events were reported for 19 (76.0%) subjects, including febrile neutropenia (7 subjects), pyrexia, hyponatremia, and malignant neoplasm progression (2 subjects each). All other events occurred in one subject each.

As detailed in Section 3.0, preliminary efficacy and safety results of venetoclax in combination with LDAC are favorable and support further evaluation in treatment naive AML patients who are not eligible to receive intensive induction chemotherapy. Rapid AML cell death in patients can result in risk of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) during initial dosing. Because of the known background risk of TLS in AML patients, venetoclax dose will be gradually increased to the final dose during initiation of study treatment in Cycle 1 combined with of LDAC to optimize disease control and enable close subject monitoring. For additional safety and efficacy data please refer to the current Investigator Brochure."

The investigator will evaluate whether the subject meets all of the eligibility criteria specified in Section 5.2.1 and Section 5.2.2 during the period from the Screening Visit up to dosing on Cycle 1 Day 1, and will record the results of this assessment and the details of the informed consent process in the subject's medical records. Eligible subjects have up to 21 days to complete screening procedures, with the exception of bone marrow samples and peripheral blasts used for AML diagnosis which can be collected within 30 days prior to randomization. Once screening procedures are completed and eligibility is confirmed, subjects will be randomized. After being randomized, subjects will have up to 5 days to initiate Cycle 1 Day 1; however, this window cannot exceed the allotted 21-day Screening period. 5.1.2 Rescreening Rescreening may be performed upon investigator discussion with the AbbVie Medical Monitor and subsequent agreement."

On cycles where LDAC is administered in a non-hospital/clinic environment (home), subjects will still visit the site within 3 days prior of Day 1 to have procedures completed so that subjects can be medically monitored for safety. All subjects will have a Final Visit performed when treatment is discontinued unless the subject has withdrawn consent to participate in the study. Baseline laboratory assessments will be obtained at Cycle 1 Day 1 prior to first dose of study treatment. PRO measures scheduled for administration should generally be completed prior to other procedures, clinical assessments, and the"

Disease assessments by the modified IWG criteria will be performed at end of Cycle 1 (± 3 days), subjects with resistant disease at end of Cycle 1 will repeat assessment at the end of Cycle 2 or Cycle 3 based on the hematologic recovery to confirm a suspected response, and every 3 cycles starting at the end of Cycle 4 and continuing until disease progression as defined per ELN 16criteria thereafter until 2 successive disease assessments result in CR or CRi, or the subject withdraws consent. For subjects achieving 2 successive disease assessments that result in CR or CRi, disease assessments consist of laboratory and physical examination, bone marrow evaluation required upon concern for relapse. For subjects who are unblinded following the final analysis results, bone marrow collections every 3 cycles starting at the end of Cycle 4 and bone marrow collection after CRi to confirm CR are not required. Bone marrow collection until 2 successive disease assessments resulting in CR or CRi is not required for these unblinded subjects. Bone marrow collection can be completed as per institutional standard of care. In addition to being reviewed by investigators, in conjunction with their hematopathologists, all pertinent information for disease assessment will be reviewed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) to provide response assessment. Interpretations of the central hematopathologist from the IRC will not be shared with sites. A charter will outline the review process for the IRC's determination of response. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will periodically review safety and efficacy data per the IDMC Charter. Details regarding the IDMC are provided in Section 5.5.5.2. 5.1.4 Post Treatment Follow-Up After study treatment has ended and subjects have completed their Final Visit, subjects will be followed for overall survival, progressive disease and post-therapy disease status (if applicable). Survival information and post treatment follow up (i.e., the date and cause of death, all post treatment cancer therapies including transplantation, regimens, dates of initiation and completion, etc.) will be collected (e.g., via telephone calls and/or clinical visits) every 2 months until the end of the study.

For subjects who had CR, CRi, MLFS, or PR at time of study drug discontinuation, hematology and disease assessments data will also be collected every 2 months (± 14 days) for 2 years after the last subject has been enrolled into the study. For subjects who had RD, MR or PD at time of study drug discontinuation, survival phone calls will be conducted every 2 months (± 14 days) for 2 years after the last subject has been enrolled into the study. 30 Day Safety Follow-Up Visit A Safety Follow-Up Visit should be performed for all subjects approximately 30 days following discontinuation of study drug and then as clinically appropriate for safety assessment. The subject will be followed until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the adverse event is achieved. A Safety Follow-Up Visit does not need to be performed for subjects who had a Final Visit conducted > 30 days after discontinuation of study drug and did not require additional adverse event follow-up.

On Cycle 1 Day 1, any events observed from the time of signing of the informed consent but prior to initial study drug administration will only be recorded as a serious or non-serious adverse event if considered by the Investigator to be causally related to the study-required procedures. At each visit, including the Final Visit and the 30-day Safety Follow-Up Visit, the subject's medical history will be reviewed and any clinically significant changes from baseline will be recorded on the adverse event eCRF. Cytogenetic Assessment Cytogenetic analysis must be performed locally from diagnostic bone marrow (preferred) or from peripheral blood if an adequate number of circulating blasts (> 109/L) are present. Historic cytogenetic data will be accepted if done within 1 month prior to screening. Molecular Markers Profiling of common genetic abnormalities in AML may be explored on a mandatory screening bone marrow sample at a laboratory designated by AbbVie. Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) Variables PRO assessments include PROMIS Fatigue SF 7a, EORTC QLQ-C30, and EQ-5D-5L.

PRO assessments should generally be completed prior to any other procedures or clinical assessments and prior to dosing; however, they may be administered following confirmation that the subject is able to receive study treatment at the visit. PROMIS Fatigue SF 7a PROMIS ®is a system of highly reliable, precise measures of patient-reported health status for physical, mental, and social well-being.17 PROMIS instruments measure concepts such as pain, fatigue, physical function, depression, anxiety and social function. Fatigue will be assessed using the PROMIS Fatigue SF that has been developed for use in oncology populations. 18,19 PROMIS Fatigue SF 7a is a seven-item questionnaire that assesses the impact and experience of fatigue over the past 7 days. The recommended minimum important difference range is 3 – 5 points; the lower bound (3) is being used as the minimum important difference in this study. 20 All questions employ the following five response options: 1 = Never, 2 = Rarely, 3 = Sometimes, 4 = Often, and 5 = Always. EORTC QLQ-C30 Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and symptoms will be assessed with the EORTC- QLQ-C30 version 3.21 The QLQ-C30 is a 30-item subject self-report questionnaire composed of both multi-item and single scales, including five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social, and cognitive), three symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), a global health status/quality of life scale, and six single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Subjects rate items on a four-point scale, with 1 as ""not at all"" and 4 as ""very much."" The QLQ-C30 was developed and validated for use in a cancer patient population, and its reliability and validity is highly consistent across different language-cultural groups. A change of 5 to 10 points is considered a small change, and the lower bound (5) will be used to define the minimum important difference. A change of ≥ 10 to < 20 points is considered a moderate change."

These dimensions are measured on a five-point scale: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The scores for the five dimensions are used to compute a single utility index score ranging from zero (0.0) to 1 (1.0) representing the general health status of the individual. The EQ-5D-5L also contains a visual analog scale (VAS) to assess the subject's overall health. The minimum important difference for the EQ-5D-5L utility index score in cancer patients is 0.08, and the minimum important difference for EQ-5D VAS is 7. 24,25 Table 3.

Subjects who meet all Inclusion Criteria and none of the Exclusion Criteria after Screening will proceed to being randomized. The site will contact the IRT to complete the randomization process and obtain study drug assignment. Subjects will be enrolled as described in Section 5.5.4 and will receive a separate unique randomization number that will be automatically recorded in the eCRF through the IRT system. This randomization number will be used only by AbbVie for loading the treatment schedule into the database. Once the screening number is assigned, if the subject is not randomized into the study, the reason for screen failure will be documented in the source document and will be captured in the IRT and eCRF.

Progressive disease is defined per European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations. Subject's response is based on most recent physical examination, bone marrow results and recent hematology values. For subjects who require a delay in the next cycle of study treatment for blood count recovery after a bone marrow evaluation, hematology values up to pre-dose labs from Day 1 of the next cycle or 2 weeks from the bone marrow if there is no additional dosing can be used to determine the modified IWG response. As a significant number of the subjects in this study might have antecedent hematologic illnesses, hematologic response including transfusion independence will also be evaluated.

71,page_71,"Venetoclax (ABT-199) M16-043 Protocol Amendment 5 EudraCT 2016-003900-30 72 5.3.6 Biomarker and Optional Exploratory Research Variables (Not Applicable for China) Mandatory Biomarker Research Variables Blood and bone marrow specimens will be collected to conduct exploratory biomarker analyses. The types of biomarkers to be analyzed may include, but are not limited to, nucleic acids, proteins, lipids or metabolites. Evaluations may include the assessment of minimal residual disease levels present after therapy, analyses of biomarkers related to the pathway(s) targeted by the study drug (i.e., BCL-2 family protein expression levels) or biomarkers believed to be related to the disease or to drug response. The information learned from analyzing these samples may be used to investigate factors impacting response to treatment, scientific questions related to AML or in the development of new therapies. Given the exploratory in nature of these assessments, the biomarker analyzes may or may not be conducted in accordance with GLP/GCP guidelines and may not be included in the clinical study report. Minimal or measurable residual disease (MRD), defined as persistence of leukemic cells after therapy, represents a potential biomarker for the depth of response to the therapy and a possible predictor for the response duration. Given the fact that AML is a phenotypic and molecularly heterogenetic disease, a single definition for meaningful measurable disease in this patient population has yet to be identified. Therefore, MRD may be explored in this study using two different technology platforms; multicolor flow cytometry (MFC) for a phenotypic assessment of residual disease and next generation sequencing (NGS) for a genetic assessment of leukemic-specific molecular abnormalities that would indicate residual disease. Another consequence of the disease heterogeneity in AML is the fact that the sensitivities of these MRD assays may vary for each subject depending upon the specific phenotypic or genetic aberrancy. Published literature suggests that most subjects are capable of achieving an MRD sensitivity of 10 –3 (Araki 2016),26therefore, this cut-off as well as others may be explored as definitions of"

Overall, the goals of the biomarker analyses described in this section are to 1) determine the relationship between drug concentration and disease status (pharmacodynamics) and 2) identify responsive patient populations (based on subject characteristics at baseline and relapse). Optional Exploratory Research Variables Pharmacogenetic DNA and RNA samples may be sequenced and data analyzed for genetic factors contributing to the disease or the subject's response to venetoclax or other study treatment in terms of pharmacokinetics, efficacy, tolerability, and safety. Such genetic factors may include genes for drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transport proteins, genes within the target pathway, other genes believed to be related to drug response, or genes related to the disease state. Some genes currently insufficiently characterized or unknown may be understood to be important at the time of analysis. The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi-study assessment of genetic factors involved in the response to venetoclax, drugs of this class, or the disease state. The samples may also be used for the development of diagnostic tests related to venetoclax, drugs of this class, or the disease state. The results of PG analyses may not be reported with the study summary. 5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment 5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects from Treatment Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study at any time. In addition, the investigator will discontinue a subject from the study at any time if the investigator considers it necessary for any reason including: ●The investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject; ●The subject's response to therapy is unsatisfactory, as evidenced by progression of disease while on study drug;"
73,page_73,"Venetoclax (ABT-199) M16-043 Protocol Amendment 5 EudraCT 2016-003900-30 74 ●The subject experiences toxicities related to study drug that require more than a 4-week (one cycle) dose interruption of venetoclax or LDAC, in the absence of clinical benefit; ●The subject requires any radiotherapy or alternate chemotherapy during the study period (with the exception of hydroxyurea [allowed in first month only]); ●The occurrence of an adverse event that precludes further LDAC administration; ●Noncompliance with the protocol. ●Treatment failure, defined as failure to achieve CR, CRi, PR, or MLFS. ●The subject becomes pregnant while on study drug. Treatment will be continued as long as the patient continues to derive clinical benefit or until documented disease progression or develops unacceptable toxicity. Accordingly, subjects may, in rare occasions, continue treatment after documented disease progression if the investigator believes it is in the best interest of the patient. Following the final analysis results, the subjects will be unblinded by the Sponsor to the treatment assignment and subjects will be allowed to continue the assigned treatment arm as long as they derive clinical benefit from the treatment in the opinion of the investigator, or until transition to commercial supply is available, or until protocol criteria for discontinuation is met. The investigator or study site personnel will inform AbbVie prior to discontinuing a subject from the study by contacting the Medical Monitor as identified in Section 7.0. All subjects will be included for analysis of safety data. In the event that a subject withdraws or is discontinued from the study, the reason(s) for the discontinuation from the study and the primary reason will be recorded and a Final Treatment Visit along with all necessary procedures per Appendix C (will be performed as soon as possible after discontinuation from the study). The subject would then enter"

At the end of the subject's participation in the study, the calendars/diaries are to be returned to the site and appropriately filed with the subject's source documents for this study. 5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any study site, for reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended termination. The investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination. Advance notice is not required by either party if the study is stopped due to safety concerns. If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately notify the investigator by telephone and subsequently provide written instructions for study termination. If, in the judgment of the investigator and AbbVie, the continued exposure to the study drug represents a significant risk to subjects, the study will be stopped. The following procedures for discontinuation will be followed: ●If the sponsor has decided to prematurely discontinue the study, the sponsor will promptly notify in writing the investigator as well as regulatory authorities of the decision and give detailed reasons for the discontinuation. ●The investigator must promptly notify the IEC/IRB and give detailed reasons for the discontinuation. The investigator must promptly notify the enrolled subjects of the premature discontinuation and administer appropriate treatments such as replacement of the treatment regimen, if applicable, by other appropriate regimens."

Compliance below 80% may require counseling of the subject by study site personnel. 5.5.7 Drug Accountability The investigator or his/her representative will verify that study drug supplies are received intact and in the correct amounts. This will be documented by signing and dating the Proof of Receipt or similar document. The investigator or his/her designated representatives will administer study drug only to subjects enrolled in the study. A current (running) and accurate inventory of study drug will be kept by the investigator and will include shipping invoices and the date on which study drug is dispensed to the subject. An overall accountability of the study drug will be performed and verified by the AbbVie monitor throughout the study and at the study site closeout visit. Upon completion or termination of the study, all original containers (containing partially used or unused venetoclax/placebo) will be returned to AbbVie according to instructions from AbbVie or the designated monitor(s). If pre-arranged between AbbVie and the site, destruction of used and unused venetoclax or placebo bottles will be performed at the site. Empty containers will be destroyed at the site. Labels must remain attached to the containers. 5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design 5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups This is a multicenter, randomized, double blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of venetoclax plus LDAC compared to an active control of placebo plus LDAC. The choice of the control group allows for a double blind assessment of the contribution of venetoclax to the safety and efficacy of the backbone regimen LDAC."
80,page_80,"Venetoclax (ABT-199) M16-043 Protocol Amendment 5 EudraCT 2016-003900-30 81 LDAC is a standard treatment option in many countries worldwide and is often referred to as low intensity therapy for AML. Low intensity therapy, such as LDAC, azacitidine, or decitabine are considered appropriate treatment approaches by the National Cooperative Cancer Network (NCCN) 26and European LeukemiaNet (ELN)28for patients who are not candidates for intensive chemotherapy induction or HSCT. Two Phase 3 trials have compared azacitidine 29and decitabine30to physician's choice therapy for older patients with newly diagnosed AML to evaluate if either provided a statistically significantly longer survival when given as the initial treatment for AML. To date, neither agent has been found to provide a significantly longer survival for patients with newly diagnosed AML than for those randomized to physician choice. The most common treatment, in both studies, amongst the patients randomized to physician choice was LDAC. The response rates to LDAC when administered as monotherapy are substantially lower than what is seen in Study M14-387 in combination with venetoclax and preliminary projections for median survival times also appear better than for the aforementioned historical experiences with LDAC monotherapy. 31 5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements Standard pharmacokinetic, statistical, clinical and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study. The efficacy measurements in this study are standard and validated. The PRO measures chosen for this study have been validated in cancer patients and include a generic HRQoL measure (EQ-5D-5L), a cancer-specific HRQoL measure that includes functional and symptom scales as well as a global health status scale (EORTC QLQ-C30), and a symptom-based measure to assess fatigue (PROMIS Fatigue SF 7a). The specific symptoms and functional aspects assessed by these measures are considered to be among the most impactful to AML patients. 32,33 5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population Subjects who have histological confirmation of acute myeloid leukemia who are treatment naïve, greater than or equal to 18 years of age, considered ineligible for treatment with a standard induction regimen due to age and comorbidity, and appropriate for LDAC"

Study M14-387, which provides the experimental arm projections, enrolled a similar patient population. 5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study The selected dosage of venetoclax is based on the results from Study M14-387, an ongoing Phase 1b/2 study of escalating doses of venetoclax in combination with LDAC in treatment naïve AML subjects greater than or equal to 65 years of age, and ineligible for treatment with a standard cytarabine and anthracycline induction regimen. In the dose escalation phase, LDAC was administered subcutaneously at 20 mg/m 2QD on Days 1 – 10 of each 28-day cycle of therapy. Venetoclax began on Day 2, to allow PK assessments of monotherapy LDAC of Cycle 1 followed by a ramp up to continuous daily dosing at the designated doses of 600 mg for Cohort 1 and 800 mg for Cohort 2. Eighteen subjects were enrolled in the Phase 1 dose escalation portion (10 subjects at the 800 mg dose and 8 subjects at 600 mg dose) and an additional 53 subjects were enrolled in the Phase 2 portion of the study at the 600 mg dose. Two of the 10 subjects enrolled to the 800 mg venetoclax cohort with LDAC experienced a dose-limiting toxicity identifying 600 mg venetoclax as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in co-administration with LDAC. An exposure-response analysis was conducted across the 71 enrolled subjects to establish the relationship between venetoclax exposure and response rates to support venetoclax dose selection in Study M16-043."
82,page_82,"Venetoclax (ABT-199) M16-043 Protocol Amendment 5 EudraCT 2016-003900-30 83 In summary, based on the preliminary results of exposure-response analysis and the observed tolerability data, the 600 mg dose of venetoclax in combination with LDAC was selected to maximize the response rates while avoiding dose-limiting toxicities. 5.6.4.1 Dose Adjustments for Venetoclax Upon Co-Administration with Anti-Fungal Agents Patients with AML are at high risk for febrile neutropenia and life threatening fungal infections. Azole agents, all of which are CYP3A inhibitors, are widely used in these patients for prophylaxis and treatment of invasive fungal infections. As venetoclax is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A, co-administration with antifungal agents which are strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors will increase venetoclax exposures. The effect of two strong CYP3A inhibitors (posaconazole and ketoconazole) on the pharmacokinetics of venetoclax was evaluated in two separate studies. Study M13-364 was conducted to evaluate the effect of ketoconazole given once daily on pharmacokinetics of single dose of venetoclax in 12 subjects with NHL 34and a cohort of 12 untreated elderly AML subjects in Study M14-358 was enrolled to assess the effect of posaconazole given twice daily on exposures of venetoclax given once daily. 35 Furthermore, prior studies indicated venetoclax bioavailability to be dependent on both food and dose. To account for the effect of covariates such as food and dose non-linearity on the bioavailability of venetoclax, a population PK model was used to simulate exposures of venetoclax in presence of strong CYP3A inhibitors. The ramp-up scheme for venetoclax when given alone is 100 mg on Day 1, 200 mg on Day 2, 400 mg on Day 3 and 600 mg QD from Day 4 onwards. To match the exposures (AUC) from these doses, venetoclax doses of 10 mg on Day 1, 20 mg on Day 2 and 50 mg QD from Day 3 onwards were chosen when co-administered with strong CYP3A"

For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severity. Adverse events, whether in response to a query, observed by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject will be recorded. All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion. 6.1.1 Definitions 6.1.1.1 Adverse Events An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product. Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event. Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event. Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, meet protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.1.7) regarding toxicity management and/or if the Investigator considers them to be adverse events. Hospitalization of a subject to allow observation and management (e.g., for IV hydration) for the purpose of TLS prophylaxis will not be captured as a serious adverse event (SAE), unless there is an additional reason for hospitalization or an additional criterion for seriousness other than hospitalization."
85,page_85,"Venetoclax (ABT-199) M16-043 Protocol Amendment 5 EudraCT 2016-003900-30 86 An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an adverse event if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry. However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event. A treatment-emergent adverse event is defined as any adverse event with onset or worsening reported by a subject from the time that the first dose of venetoclax/placebo or LDAC is administered until 30 days have elapsed following discontinuation of venetoclax/placebo and LDAC administration. 6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a serious adverse event within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event: Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject. Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken. This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form. Hospitalization or Prolongation of HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay. This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility or hospitalization for respite care. Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss."

Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle). Important Medical Event Requiring Medical or Surgical Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life- threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity). Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Deaths related to disease progression will not be recorded as adverse events. 6.1.1.3 Adverse Events Expected due to Study Related Endpoints Disease progression is an endpoint of this study. Disease progression should not be reported as an adverse event. 6.1.1.3.1 Deaths For this protocol, overall survival is an efficacy endpoint. Deaths that occur during the protocol specified adverse event collection period (Section 6.1.4) that are attributed by the investigator solely to progression of AML should be recorded only on the Death eCRF and the Study Completion Form eCRF. All other deaths during the protocol specified"

All deaths occurring after adverse event collection period should be collected in Death eCRF. Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported. The term ""sudden death"" should only be used for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without pre-existing heart disease, within one hour of the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case of an unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the patient was last seen alive and stable. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, ""unexplained death"" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), ""unexplained death"" should be replaced by the established cause of death. 6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity The investigator will rate the severity of each adverse event according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE Version 4.03). When applicable, once the diagnosis is confirmed the medical term should be reported for an event rather than the abnormal lab values as identified in CTCAE. If a reported adverse event increases in severity, the initial adverse event should be given final outcome date and a new adverse event must be reported to reflect the change in severity. If a reported adverse event increases in severity, the initial adverse event should be given final outcome date and a new adverse event must be reported to reflect the change in severity such that the dates on these AE's cannot overlap. For all reported serious adverse events that increase in severity, the supplemental eCRFs also need to be updated to reflect any changes due to the increase in severity."
88,page_88,"Venetoclax (ABT-199) M16-043 Protocol Amendment 5 EudraCT 2016-003900-30 89 For adverse events not captured by the Common Terminology Criteria, the following should be used: Grade 1 The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject (mild). Grade 2 The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject's usual activities (moderate). Grade 3 The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating (moderate to severe). Grade 4 The adverse event is life-threatening requiring urgent intervention (severe). Grade 5 The adverse event resulted in death of the subject (severe). 6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse event to the use of study drug: Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgement, and potential alternative causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship. No Reasonable PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, biologic plausibility, clinical judgement, and potential alternative causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a causal relationship. The Investigator will assess the relationship of each adverse event to venetoclax/placebo, and to LDAC. Some events may be reasonably related to more than one drug or to none. For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being related to the study drug will be considered ""associated."" Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered ""not associated."" In addition, when the Investigator has not reported causality or deemed it not assessable, AbbVie will consider the event associated to study drug."

Serious and nonserious adverse events occurring after the study-specific informed consent is signed but prior to the initial dose of venetoclax/placebo, or LDAC will be collected only if they are considered by the Investigator to be causally related to the study-required procedures. In addition, all serious and nonserious adverse events reported from the time of study drug administration until 30 days following discontinuation of study drug administration have elapsed will be collected, whether elicited or spontaneously reported by the subject. Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 2 . Figure 2. Adverse Event Collection * Only if considered by the Investigator to be causally related to study-required procedures."

Subjects who become pregnant during the study must be discontinued. If a pregnancy occurs in a study subject or in the partner of a study subject, information regarding the pregnancy and the outcome will be collected. In the event of pregnancy occurring in a subject's partner during the study, written informed consent from the partner must be obtained prior to collection of any such information. A separate consent will be provided by AbbVie for this purpose. Pregnancy in a subject's partner will be collected from the date of the first dose through 180 days following the last dose of study drug. The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is considered a SAE and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event. 6.1.7 Toxicity Management Management of Cytopenias, Infections, and Other Adverse Events Myelosuppression and the related adverse events (thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, and febrile neutropenia) are common in both treated and untreated subjects with AML. Subjects with baseline neutropenia or have significant bone marrow involvement may be particularly at high risk. If a participant achieves a CRi or a morphologic leukemia free bone marrow, and has Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia persisting beyond Day 28, venetoclax should be interrupted from Day 28 until ANC ≥ 500 – 1000/ μL and platelet count ≥ 25 – 100 × 10 3/μL. Typically, if persistent AML remains in the bone marrow, concurrent cytopenias are thought to be attributable to the disease process of AML and continued treatment with venetoclax and"
93,page_93,"Venetoclax (ABT-199) M16-043 Protocol Amendment 5 EudraCT 2016-003900-30 94 LDAC may continue on schedule. In subsequent cycles, if a subject with previous CR presents with new onset Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia lasting more than one week, unless it is due to the underlying disease, venetoclax dosing may be interrupted until ANC recovery to ≥ 500 – 1000/ μL and platelet count ≥ 25 – 100 × 10 3/μL per investigator discretion in consultation with the AbbVie medical monitor. Venetoclax may be re-initiated at a lower dose, or discontinued if a minimal dose is not tolerable, per discussion with the AbbVie medical monitor. Administration of venetoclax in subjects with lymphoproliferative disorders has been associated with clinically significant lymphopen ia (B and T lymphocyte subtypes). Anti- infective prophylaxis for viral, fungal, bacterial or Pneumocystis infections are required for all subjects with ANC of < 500/ μL. Institutional infectious organisms and their drug resistance patterns should primarily be considered and the choice of these agents should be based on regional guidelines or institutional standards. Potential for drug-drug interactions should be considered. Please refer to Table 1, Table 2, and Appendix I for a description of excluded and cautionary medications and implement dose reductions for venetoclax/placebo as necessary. If a subject is continuing to respond based on the bone marrow assessment after Cycle 2 of treatment, but has persistent cytopenias (cytopenias that occur after Day 28 of a Cycle during Cycle 2 and beyond), venetoclax dose may be reduced as follows: Table 7. Dose Reduction Guidelines for Management of Persistent Neutropenia or Thrombocytopenia Venetoclax Dose/Duration New Venetoclax Dose/Duration 600 mg daily × 28 day cycles 600 mg daily × 21 days with 7 day interruption 600 mg daily × 21/28 day cycles 600 mg daily × 14 days with 14 day interruption 600 mg daily × 14/28 day cycles 400 mg daily × 14 days with 14 day interruption Cytopenias during Cycle 1 or 2 may be due to bone marrow involvement by AML and therefore dose reductions during Cycle 1 or 2 are not typically recommended. If an"
94,page_94,"Venetoclax (ABT-199) M16-043 Protocol Amendment 5 EudraCT 2016-003900-30 95 investigator believes a particular patient would benefit from a dose reduction during Cycle 1 or 2, the investigator should discuss with the medical monitor. If dose reductions or interruptions for events other than cytopenias or infections are thought to be necessary by the investigator, a discussion with the AbbVie medical monitor is required and may be approved upon consultation. Delays greater than 21 days must be discussed with the AbbVie medical monitor or a designee. Standard Therapy: Low – Dose Cytarabine In a recent international clinical trial, subjects receiving LDAC experienced the following treatment emergent CTCAE grade 3 or 4 adverse events at a rate of at least 10%: thrombocytopenia 35%, anemia 27%, febrile neutropenia 25%, disease progression 22%, neutropenia 20%, pneumonia 19%, general physical health deterioration 16%, and leukopenia 10%. 36 It is unknown whether the aforementioned adverse events are attributable to receiving treatment with LDAC or were attributable to the underlying health condition of AML. Complications of myelosuppression, including infections and bleeding, may be exacerbated by treatment with LDAC. During Cycle 2 and subsequent cycles, study treatments may be delayed at the discretion of the investigator, if the subject experiences myelosuppression associated complications, such as those described below: ●Febrile neutropenia (temperature ≥ 38.5°C and ANC < 1,000/ μL) ●Active viral, bacterial or fungal infection (i.e., requiring IV anti-infectives or extensive supportive care) ●Hemorrhage (gastrointestinal, genito-urinary, pulmonary with platelets < 25,000/μ L or any central nervous system hemorrhage) Treatment with LDAC may be resumed once the above conditions have improved or have been stabilized with adequate treatment (anti-infective therapy, transfusions, or growth factors). Myelosuppression caused by LDAC is reversible. Complete blood and platelet counts should be performed regularly, as clinically indicated and prior to each treatment cycle."
95,page_95,"Venetoclax (ABT-199) M16-043 Protocol Amendment 5 EudraCT 2016-003900-30 96 In the presence of myelosuppression or its complications, treatment with LDAC may be interrupted or supportive measures instituted. LDAC dose reductions are not typically recommended. If a dose reduction is believed to be necessary a discussion with the AbbVie medical monitor is required. 6.1.7.1 Management of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) There is a potential risk for TLS in subjects with AML, especially in those with elevated leukocyte count, circulating blasts, elevated pretreatment LDH levels, renal dysfunction, and dehydration. In addition, on-target effect of venetoclax could lead to rapid cell death and pose a risk of TLS. To mitigate the risk for TLS all subjects enrolled in the study will need TLS prophylaxis and monitoring. Prophylactic reductions of potassium, inorganic phosphorus or uric acid above normal range are recommended prior to beginning study treatment and continue based on the ongoing risk of TLS. For subjects at higher risk for TLS (i.e., circulating blasts, high burden of leukemia involvement in bone marrow, elevated pretreatment LDH levels, or renal dysfunction), additional mitigation measures including more intensive laboratory monitoring and interventions should be implemented. Lower starting dose of venetoclax/placebo may be considered (i.e., 50 mg). Below are the minimum requirements for TLS prophylaxis and management for all subjects enrolled into the study. All other prophylaxis and monitoring procedures for TLS will be implemented as per regional guidelines/institutional standards: ●All subjects will be hospitalized on or before Day 1 of Cycle 1 prior to administration of the initial dose of study treatment and remain in the hospital for at least for 24 hours after reaching the final dose of venetoclax. ●All subjects must receive uric acid reducing agent, adequate oral and intravenous hydration as tolerated while monitoring the fluid status of the subject prior to and during the ramp up of venetoclax/placebo. The uric acid reducing agent, type of fluids and the rate of infusion will be determined by the investigator based on regional standards or institutional guidelines."

No additional venetoclax/placebo dose should be administered until resolution. For continued dosing of venetoclax/placebo, monitor for evidence of TLS during study treatment, and manage abnormalities of serum creatinine and electrolytes promptly. For continued dosing of venetoclax/placebo, monitor for evidence of TLS during treatment, and manage abnormalities of serum creatinine, uric acid and electrolytes promptly. For subjects at higher risk (i.e., circulating blasts), more intensive measures should considered. 6.2 Product Complaint 6.2.1 Definition A Product Complaint is any Complaint (see Section 6.0for the definition) related to the biologic or drug component of the product.

All follow-up information is to be reported to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) and documented in source as required by the Sponsor. Product complaints associated with adverse events will be reported in the study summary. All other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis. Product complaints may require return of the product with the alleged complaint condition. In instances where a return is requested, every effort should be made by the Investigator to return the product within 30 days. If returns cannot be accommodated within 30 days, the site will need to provide justification and an estimated date of return. The description of the complaint is important for AbbVie in order to enable AbbVie to investigate and determine if any corrective actions are required. 7.0 Protocol Deviations AbbVie does not allow intentional/prospective deviations from the protocol unless when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. The principal investigator is responsible for complying with all protocol requirements, and applicable global and local laws regarding protocol deviations.

The safety analysis set will be used for safety analyses. The full analysis set consists of all randomized subjects. The full analysis set will be used for efficacy analyses. 8.1.2 Baseline Characteristics All baseline summary statistics and analyses will be based on characteristics prior to the initiation of any component of study drug (or randomization for non-treated subjects). Unless otherwise stated, baseline for a given variable will be defined as the last value for that variable obtained prior to the first dose of any component of study drug.

Post-baseline measurements more than 30 days after the last dose of study drug will not be included. Subjects that do not have a baseline measurement or do not have any post-baseline measurements will not be included. Where applicable, blood chemistry and hematology laboratory determinations will be categorized according to NCI CTCAE (version 4.03) grades, and shifts from baseline NCI CTCAE grades to maximum and final post-baseline grades will be assessed. The baseline and final grades will be defined respectively as the grade of the last measurement collected prior to the first dose of study drug, and as the last post-baseline measurement collected no more than 30 days after the last dose of study drug. The percentage of subjects experiencing a shift from baseline grades of 0 to 2 to maximum post-baseline grades of 3 to 4, and from baseline grades of 0 to 2 to final post baseline grades of 3 to 4"

In the event a subject withdraws consent to participate from the study, stored biomarker and exploratory research samples will continue to be used for research and analysis. In the event that a subject would like to withdraw consent for research using these samples, the subject may request that their samples be withdrawn. Once AbbVie receives the request, remaining biomarker and exploratory research samples will be destroyed. If the subject changes his/her consent, and the samples have already been tested, those results will still remain as part of the overall research data. A separate informed consent, approved by an IRB/IEC, must be voluntarily signed and dated before samples are collected for optional exploratory research. The nature of the testing should be explained and the subject given an opportunity to ask questions. This separate informed consent must be signed before the samples are collected and any testing is performed. If the subject does not consent to provide samples for the optional exploratory research, it will not impact their participation in the study. 9.3.1 Informed Consent Form and Explanatory Material In Japan, the principal investigator will prepare the consent form and explanatory material required to obtain subject's consent to participate in the study with the cooperation of the sponsor and will revise these documents as required.

A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must be performed for all subjects during screening to confirm diagnosis and to collect mandatory samples for mandatory biomarker assessments. Historical bone marrow aspirates and biopsies assessed locally to confirm the diagnosis may be used as baseline assessment to satisfy eligibility criteria if they were collected as standard of care within 30 days prior to randomization. During screening, after the informed consent is signed, bone marrow aspirates and biopsies may be collected to confirm the diagnosis to satisfy eligibility criteria. During screening, after informed consent is signed, a bone marrow aspirate must be performed for all subjects to collect samples for mandatory biomarker assessments (biomarker collections are not applicable to subjects enrolled in China) . Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy samples must be collected for all subjects at each of the disease assessments. Bone marrow core biopsy sample collection will be considered an optional procedure for subjects enrolled at sites in countries where an aspirate evaluation by morphologic assessment and flow cytometry is considered standard of care. For these subjects, if a bone marrow aspirate sample is inadequate or un- evaluable, a repeat aspirate sample and biopsy must be performed within 7 days. Bone marrow aspirates and/or biopsies performed in addition to those required per protocol as standard of care throughout the study should also be captured on an eCRF. The corresponding PHI redacted local laboratory pathology report/bone marrow report should be sent to the central laboratory for each local disease assessment which is conducted. o. End of Cycle 1 bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must be performed within ± 3 days of Cycle 1 Day 28. Assessments should be performed and resulted prior to the administration of study drugs for Cycle 2. For subjects who require a delay in study treatment for blood count recovery after a bone marrow evaluation, hematology values up to pre-dose labs from Day 1 of the next cycle or 2 weeks from the bone marrow if there is no additional dosing can be used to determine the IWG response. For all subjects a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must be performed at end of Cycle 4 and every 3 cycles (± 1 week) and upon concern for relapse unless otherwise indicated in Section 5.3.1.1. The corresponding PHI redacted local laboratory pathology report will be sent to the central laboratory for IRC review. Has been changed to read: n.
