The screening procedures consist of signing the informed consent form for the OLE study and initiation of continuous physical act ivity monitoring via a medical device (Embrace device, Empat ica, Inc., Cambridge, MA) worn on the wrist . Any s creening procedure for the OLE study must not be done until after com pletion of all the assessments and procedu res required by the POC protocol for the Day 85 POC Visi t. Eligibilit y for the OLE study will be assessed and enrollment intothe OLE study will occur (at the earliest) at the pati ent’s l ast follow-up visit in the POC study (Day 113 POC Visi t). After comp letion of all Day 113 POC Vi sit assessments, the pati ent will be assessed for eligibilit y for enrollment into the OLE study per the OLE inclusio n and exclusion criteria. Any OLE assessment or procedure designated on the Day 113POC Visit must not be perfo rmed until after com pletion of all the assessments and procedures required by the POC protocol for the Day 113POC Visit. Eligibilit y for the OLE study will be determined based onresul ts of safet y laboratory testing from the patient’s Day 85POC Visit,the assessments from the pati ent’s Day 113 POC Visit, and addit ional procedures to be performed predose on OLE Day 1. Patients meet ing all eligibilit y criteria will be enrolled into the OLE study and may receive the first infusio n of M281 under this protoc ol (day of first infusion is considered OLE Day 1). Patients not meet ing all OLE eligibilit y criteria will be considered screening failures for the OLE study and will not be enrolled or receive treatment under this protocol . If it is not feasible to comp lete any /all desi gnated OLE assessments/procedures on the same day as the Day 113 POC Visi t, or if there is a valid reason to delay enrollment of the patient in the OLE study , the Invest igator can confirm the patient’s eligibilit y and enro ll the pat ient ata later date as agreed between the Invest igator and Medical Monitor; however, depending on the l ength of the delay the pat ient may need to have an addit ional unscheduled blood draw for safet y laboratory testing to confirm eligibilit y for the OLE study . Patients who are enrolled in the OLE study will initially receive M281 30 mg/kg every 4weeks ( Q4W )by intravenous (IV) infusio n. This dose (M281 30 mg/kg Q4W) is one of the doses evaluated in the POC study . Th isstarting dose and dosing frequency may be revis ed if available results fro mthe POC study reveal a different optimal dose for development . However, the revised dose and dosing frequency in the OLE study will not exceed 60 mg/kg every 2 weeks ( Q2W ), which is the highest dose and most frequent dos ing interval eval uated in the POC study . Patientsshoul d be m aintained on a stable M281 dose and dosing frequency for at least the first 8weeks of the OLE study . If the starti ng dose and dosing frequency for the study is revis ed after the pati ent started receiv ingthe dose of 30mg/kg Q4W, it is recommended that the pati ent receive sthe revised dose f or at l east 8 weeks regardless of thelength of time the patient receiv edthe 30 mg/kg Q4W treatm ent. After at l east 8 weeks of treatment on a stable dos e of M281, the dose and/or dosing frequency of M281 maybe individually adjusted for a given patient at the discretion of the Invest igator and previous consultat ion with the Medi cal Monitor , based on the patient’s tolerabilit y to M281 and the patient’s MG status . Theindividually adjusted dose will not exceed 60 mg/kg and the dosing frequency will not exceed Q2W . Each p atient will be observed for safet y after the irfirst 2infusions in the study ; if no clinically relevant AEs or abnormal vital signs relate d to the infusion are observed in these"

Apost-infusio n observat ion peri od is also required for the patient’s first infusio n at the higher M281 dose level . All pat ients must attend clinic visits at 2, 4, and 8weeks after the first infusio n (on OLE Day 1)to undergo safet y, tolerabilit y, efficacy , PD, and immunogenicit y assessments. Serum bio markers will also be explored. After Week 8, pati ents will receive an infusio nof M281 on a Q2W or Q4W basis , depending on the dosing frequency established for the patient. All infusio ns may be administered at the site, or e very other infusio n(except those that fall every 12 weeks [Q12W] )may be administered in the ho meor at another location per the Infusio n Manual ,at the di screti on of the Invest igator and if this opti on is made available tothe site. As an example, for p atients continuing on a Q4W regimen at Week 8, the schedul e for opti onal home infusio ns woul d be as fo llows: Weeks 16, 28, and40(assuming no M281 dose increase and assuming end of treatm entat Week 52) . As an example, f or pati ents switching to a Q2W regimen at Week 8, the schedule for optional home infusi ons woul d be as fo llows: Weeks 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, and 50 (assuming no M281 dose increase and assuming end o f treatm entat Week 52). Each infusio n will be administered per the Infusio n Manual. On each infusio n day predose vital signs will be measured. Forinfusions administered in the clinic, ECGs will also be measured, and AEs and conco mitant m edicat ion/therapy since the previous clinical visit will be recorded. If the M281 dose and/or dosing frequency is adjusted, the first infusio n at the new dose/frequency must occur at a clinic visit ; for increase sin the M281 dose level (but not for change in dosing frequency) , the pati ent will undergo a post-infusio n observat ion peri od following the first infusio n at the higher dose level per the Infusio n Manual . In the event of either a dose increase and/or dosing frequency increase, the pati ent’s next scheduled infusio n must be conducted in the clinic because a blood sample for safet y laboratory testing must be obtained and a physical examinat ion must be performed within 2 to 4weeks after the first infusio n at the new dose/dosing frequency . Regardless of the patient’s dosing frequency , the full schedule of safet y, tolerabilit y, efficacy, PD, and immunogenicit y assessments will be done at Week 12 and Q12W thereaft er. The duration of each pat ient’s participat ion in the study is planned to be approximately 1year or until the study is terminated by the Sponsor. Patients will return to the clinic approximately 8 weeks after their last infusio n for follow-up assessme nts. Patients shoul d continue their stable therapeutic regimen (standard of care) for gMG and shoul d maintain the same dose and regimen for at least the first 8weeks of the OLE study (unless toxicit y or saf ety/tolerabilit yissues mandate a change ). In th e event the starting dose of M281 (30mg/kg Q4W )is revis ed to a different dose and/or dosing frequency , it is recommended that the dose and regimen of concomi tant treatm ent not be changed until the patient’s M281 dose has been stable for at least 8 weeks . A consultation wit h the Medical Moni tor regarding changes to the patient’s standard -of-care therapy is recommended . An independent Drug Safet y Moni toring Board (DSMB) will be responsible for oversight of patient safet y during the study . The DSMB will me et on a regular basis and review all available data (AEs, SAEs, AESIs, and laboratory resul ts); ad hoc m eetings willbe scheduled as needed. The specific responsibilit ies of the DSMB will be outlined in a DSMB charter ."

Clinical Trial Protocol : MOM-M281 -005 01August 2019 Confidential Page 13of 531INTRODUCTION Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare, heterogeneous, neuro muscular disease characterized by fluctuating, f atigable muscle weakness . Generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is characterized by the fluctuating and variable combinat ion of weakness in ocular, bulbar, limb, neck, and respiratory muscles .Myasthenia gravis is caused by pathogenic autoantibodies dir ected against proteins in the postsynaptic membrane of the neuro muscular junct ion. In most patients (approximately 85% of cases ),circulat ing antibodies target the acetylcho line receptor (AChR) ; to a l esser extent (<10% of cases ), ant ibodies to the muscle -specific kinase (MuSK) , orlipoprotein -related protein 4are present (Meriggio li and Sanders 2012 ; Zhang et al 2012 ). Preferred symptomat ic treatment is with the acet ylcho linesterase in hibitor, py ridosti gmine. However, to meet the treatment goals of restoring or maintaining full or nearly full physical funct ion and high qualit y of life, m ost pati ents with MG also requi re treatment wi th immunosuppressive medicat ion(s) ( Gilhus 2016 ; Gilhus et al 2016 ; Mantegazza and Antozzi 2018 ).This incl udes treatm ent aime d at reducing the production of autoantibodies, such as immunosuppressio n with corti costeroi ds and second -line agents (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenol ate m ofetil/mycopheno lic acid, and B cell modificati on/ablati on), as well as those aimed at increasing autoantibody removal such as plasma exchange, immunoadsorption, or immunomodulatory doses of intravenous immunogl obulin (IVIG) ( Sanders et al 2016 ; Gilhus 2016; Gilhus et al 2016 ). While many patients with gMG can be managed wit h current therapies, 10%- 15% of patients fail to respond adequately to or cannot tol erate m ultiple therapi es for MG and continue to suffer profound muscle weakness and severe disease symptoms that limit funct ion and can be life-threatening ( Silvestri and Wo lfe2014 ; Howard et al 2013 ; Howard et al 2017 ; Sanders etal 2016 ; Sathasivam 2014 ; Mantegazza and Antozzi 2018 ), and up to 80% fail to achieve complete and stable remissio n (Mantegazza and Antozzi 2018 ). Despite medical advances in patient care, a re cent analysis of data fro m patient regi stries indicates that gMG is st ill associ ated wi th increased mortalit y compared to the general populat ion, wi th an est imated mortalit y rate rati o of 1.4 (range 1.24 –1.60) ( Hansen et al 2016 ).Thus, there is a clear unmet medical need for new safe and eff ective treatm ents for gMG. Momenta Pharmaceut icals, Inc. (Momenta) is developing M281 for the treatment of patients with gMG. M281 is a fully human, aglycosylated immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 antibody that targets the neonatal Fcreceptor (FcRn) IgG binding site with high affinit y, thereby interfering wi th the binding of nat ive IgG. In cells of the reticuloendothelial system, FcRn binding of IgG protects it fro m degradation and contributes to its long half -life. In pati ents with gMG, M281 i s expected to reduce circulat ing levels o f IgG antibodies by blocking IgG recycling, including the pathogenic autoantibodies that cause MG, poten tially leading to improvement of the disease manifestations .Administrati on of M281 is not expected to reduce l evels of other immunoglobulins, including IgA, IgM, or IgE, or impact other aspects of immune system response to infection, considering FcRn blockage only affects IgG half-life."
13,page_13,"M281 Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Clinical Trial Protocol : MOM-M281 -005 01August 2019 Confidential Page 14of 53A co mpleted Phase 1 study of M281 in heal thy volunteers (MOM -M281 -001) showed that M281 was well tolerated in single infusio ns of doses up to 60 mg/kg (the highest single dose tested) and in up to 4 weekly infusio ns of doses up to 30 mg/kg (the highest repeat dose tested). Self-limited, recoverable decreases in total serum IgG concentrations to a mean of approximately 15% to 20% of baseline values (an 80% to 85% decrease from baseline) were observed, confirming the drug’s mechanism o f action . Further details are provided in the Investigator Brochure. The Phase 2, placebo -controlled, proof -of-concept (POC) study (MOM -M281 -004, hereafter referred to as the POC study ) in patients with gMG is evaluat ingthe therapeuti c potenti al of single (60 mg/kg) and repeat doses of M281 (5 mg/kg eve ry 4weeks [Q4W], 30 mg/kg Q4W, and 60 mg/kg every 2 weeks [Q2W]) for the treatment of patients with gMG who have an insufficient clinical response to ongoing, stable standard -of-care therapy . Safet y, tolerabilit y, efficacy, pharmacodynamics ( PD), and imm unogenicit y of M281 co mpared with placebo are being evaluated in the Phase 2 study over an 8 -week Treatment Period and an 8-week Follow- up Peri od after the last infusio n of study drug . Upon com pletion of the placebo -controlled POC study , pati ents have the option to enroll in this open -label extensio n (OLE) study to receive treatm ent wi th M281. The purpose of this OLE study is to collect long -term safety , tolerabili ty, efficacy , PD, and immunogenicit y data forM281 in patients who completed the POC study (MOM -M281 -004) . Potential Risks and Plans for Mitigation Reduction o f Serum Albumin Levels: Asymptomat ic decreases in serum albumin concentrations to a mean of 20% to 25% decrease from baseline were observed in the Phase 1 clinical study (MOM -M281 -001). This mild hypoalbuminemia was self -limited over the duration of dosing of M281 and recovered rapidly following dose cessati on. Serum albumin levels and clinical symptoms related to hypoalbuminemia will be monitored throughout the study , and hypoalbuminemi a-related adverse event ( AE)stopping rules are included in Section 6.6.1 ofthis protocol . Reduction o f Circulat ing IgG Levels: In the Phase 1 clinical study (MOM -M281 -001), subjects administered with M281 show ed dose-dependent reduction of circulating IgG levels, which is an ant icipated PD effect of M281 and contributes to its potential benefit in MG. It is important to note that the normal immune response to produce IgM and IgG in response to a foreign ant igen proceeds during treatm ent wi th FcRn blo ckers ( Nixon et al 2015 ). To date, M281 has not been associated with an increase in infection -related events in nonclinical or clinical studies. Published clinical studies o f other invest igational agents that interfere wit h FcRn have not revealed an increase inincidence or severit y of infecti ons ( Kiessling et al 2017 ; Argenx 2017; Blumberg et al 2017 ; Robak et al 2017 ). These observat ions are suggestive, but not definit ive, that the risk for infect ions associated with M281 administration may prove to be l ow. Given the theoreti cal potenti al for increa sed infect ion risk with reduced circulat ing IgG levels,"

The Screening Period for the OLE study begins (at the earliest) at the Day 85 POC Vi sit (ie,4weeks after the last dose of study drug in the POC study ) and ends upon enrollment in the OLE study . The screening procedures consist of signing the informed consent form for the OLE study and ini tiation of continuous physical act ivity monitoring via a medical device (Embrace device, Empat ica, Inc., Cambridge, MA) worn on the wrist. Eligi bility for the OLE study will be assessed and enrollment into the OLE study will occur (at the earliest) after com pletion of assessments at the pati ent’s l ast follow-up visit in the POC study (Day 113 POC Visit). Thus, the Day 113 POC Visit can be Day 1 for the OLE; patients who meet the eligibilit y criteria for the OLE study can receive their first open -label infusio n of M281 on the sam e day . Patients who are enrolled in the OLE study will initi ally receive M281 30 mg/kg Q4W by intravenous (IV) infusio n. This dose (M281 30 mg/kg Q4W) is one of the doses evaluated in the POC study . Thi s starti ng dose and dosing frequency may be revised if available results from the POC study reveal a different optimal dose for development. However, the revised dose and dosing frequency in the OLE study will not exceed 60 mg/kg Q2W, which is the highest dose and most frequent dosing interval evaluated in the POC study . After at l east 8 weeks of treatment on a stable dose of M281, the dose and/or dosing frequency of M281 m ay be individually adjusted for a given patient at the discretion of the Invest igator and previous consultat ion with the Medi cal Monitor, based on the patient’s tolerabilit y to M281 and the patient’s MG status. The individually adjusted dose will not exceed 60 mg/kg and the dosing frequency will not exceed Q2W. Each p atient will be observed for safet y after the irfirst 2infusions in the study ; if no clinically relevant AEs or abnormal vital signs related to the infusion are observed in these first 2infusions, the post -infusio n observat ion period is no longer needed unless the M281 dose l evel is later increased. A post -infusio n observat ion peri od is also required for the patient’s first infusio n at the higher M281 dose level . All pat ients must attend clinic visits at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the first infusio n (on OLE Day 1 )to undergo safet y, tolerabilit y, efficacy , PD, and immunogenicit y assessments. Serum bio markers will also be explored. After Week 8, pati ents will receive aninfusio nof M281 on a Q2W or Q4W basis depending on the dosing frequency established for the pati ent.All infusio ns may be administered at the site, or every other infusio n(except those that fall every 12 weeks [Q12W]) may be administered in the ho me or at another location pe r the Infusi on Manual, at the discretion of"

As an example, for patients continuing on a Q4W regimen at Week 8, the schedul e for opti onal hom e infusio ns woul d be as fo llows: Weeks 16, 28, and40(assuming no M281 dose increase and assuming end of treatm entat Week 52). As an example, f or pati ents swi tching to a Q2W regimen at Week 8, the schedule for the optional ho me infusio ns would be as fo llows: Weeks 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46 , and 50 (assuming no M281 dose increase and assuming end of treatm entat Week 52). Each infusio n will be administered per the Infusio n Manual. On each infusio n day predose vital signs will be measured. For infusio ns administered in the clinic, electroca rdiogram s (ECGs) will also be measured, and AEs and concomitant medication/therapy since the previous clinical visit will be recorded. If the M281 dose and/or dosing frequency is adjusted, the first infusio n at the new dose/frequency must occur at a clini c visi t; for increases in the M281 dose level (but not for change in dosing frequency), the patient will undergo a post-infusio n observat ion peri od following the fi rst infusi on at the hi gher dose level per the Infusio n Manual. In the event of eithera dos e increase and/or dosing frequency increase, the patient’s next scheduled infusio n must be conducted in the clinic because a blood sam ple for saf ety laboratory testing must be obtained and a physical examinat ion must be perform ed within 2 to 4weeks after the first infusi on at the new dose/dosing frequency . Regardless of the pat ient’s dosing frequency, the full schedule of safet y, tolerabili ty, efficacy, PD, and immunogenicit y assessments will be done at Week 12 and Q12W thereafter. The durati on of each p atient’s part icipation in the study is planned to be approximately 1 year or until the study is terminated by the Sponsor. Patients will return to the clinic approximately 8weeks after their last infusio n for follow-up assessments. Patients shoul d cont inue thei r stable therapeutic regimen (standard of care) for gMG and shoul d maintain the same dose and regimen for at least the first 8 weeks of the OLE study (unless toxicit y or saf ety/tolerabilit y issues mandate a change). In the event the starting dose of M281 (30mg/kg Q4W )is revis ed to a different dose and/or dosing frequency , itis recommended that the dose and regimen of concomitant treatment not be changed until the patient’s M281 dose has been stable for at least 8 weeks. A consultation wit h the M edical Moni tor regarding changes to the patient’s standard -of-care therapy is recommended . The Schedule o f Study Assessments is provi ded in Section 6. 3.2 Rationale for Study Design The study will enrollpatients w ithgMG who compl eted the POC study (MOM -M281 -004) without discont inuing study drug during the POC study for reasons other than the need for rescue therapy as specified in the POC protocol , and who com pleted the protocol -specified 8weeks of fo llow-up afte r the last dose of study drug in the POC study . Such patients may have been exposed to one or more doses of M281 or may have received placebo in the POC study . Therefore, the safet y, tolerabilit y, efficacy, PD, and immunogenicit y assessments for first 8 weeks of this OLE study are similar to those for the POC study. PK sampling is not being done for this study because PK isbeingcharacterized in the POC study ."

Clinical Trial Protocol : MOM-M281 -005 01August 2019 Confidential Page 18of 53Using data derived from nonclinical studies in nonhuman primate s and data fro m the completed Phase 1 study of M281 in healt hy vo lunteers (MOM -M281 -001), the M281 dose that will init ially be used at the start of the OLE study is 30 mg/kg given Q4W. This dose (M281 30 mg/kg Q4W) is one of the doses evaluated in the POC study . The dose regimen o f 30mg/kg Q4W was selected to achieve significant IgG lowering while not fully saturating the FcRn receptor for the dosing interval. The top dose allowed for adjust ment (60mg/kg Q2W) is expected to achieve maximum IgG reductio n over the treatment period. The starting dose and dosing frequency may be revis ed based on available results from the POC study . Unlike the POC study , dose adj ustment of M281 and of gMG standard- of-care therapy is allowed for individual pat ients after at l east 8 weeks on a stable M281 dose to reflect real -world pract ice of tailoring the medicat ion regime nbased on tolerabilit y and/or gMG status. T he dose and dosing frequency in the OLE study will not exceed 60 mg/kg Q2W, which is the highest dose and most frequent dosing interval eva luated in the POC study . The approximate 1-year durati on of the study will be sufficient to characterize the long -term safet yandtolerabilit y, and to further evaluate efficacy , PD, and immunogenicit y of M281. 3.3 Study Duration Following a Screening Period, the duration of each pati ent’s parti cipat ion inthe study is planned to be approximately 1year or until the study is terminated by the Sponsor. 4STUDY POPULATION SELECTION 4.1 Study Population The sample size for the OLE study will depend on the enrollment in the POC study , which plans f or approximately 60 patients with possible expansio n up to 90 patients. 4.2 Screening Period The Screening Period for the OLE study begins (at the earliest) at the Day 85 POC Vi sit and ends upon enrollment in the OLE study . The sc reening procedures consist of signing the inform ed consent form for the OLE study and ini tiation of cont inuous physical act ivity monitoring via the Embrace device. Any screening procedure for the OLE study must not be done until after com pletion of all th e assessments and procedures required by the POC protocol for the Day 85 POC Visit.

Any OLE assessment or procedure designated on the Day 113POC Visitmust not be perform ed until after com pletion of all the assessme nts and procedures requi red by the POC protocol for the Day 113POC Visit. After completion o f all Day 113 POC Vi sitassessments , the pati ent will be assessed for eligibilit y for enrollment into the OLE study per the OLE inclusio n and exclusio n criteria. Eligibilit y for the OLE study will be determined based on results of safety laboratory testing from the pat ient’s Day 85 POC Visit, the assessments from the pati ent’s Day 113 POC Visit, and addi tional procedures to be perform ed predose on OLE Day 1. Pati ents m eeting all eligibilit y criteria will be enrolled into the OLE study and m ay receive the first infusion of M281 under this protocol (day of first infusi on is considered OLE Day 1). Pati ents not m eeting all OLE eligibili ty criteria will be considered screening failures for the OLE study and will not be enrolled or receive treatm ent under this protocol. If it is not feasible to complete any /all desi gnated OLE assessments/procedures on the same day asthe Day 113 POC Visi t, or if there is a valid reason to del ay enrollment of the patient in the OLE study , the Invest igator can confirm the patient’s eligibilit y and enro ll the pat ient at a l ater date as agreed between the Invest igator and Medical Monitor; however, depending on the l ength of the delay the pat ient may need to have an addi tional unscheduled blood draw for safet y laboratory testingto confirm eligibilit y for the OLE study . 4.4 Inclusion Criteria 1.Has completed the M281 POC study (ie, participated in the POC study without discontinuing study drug forreasons other than the need for rescue therapy as specified in the POC protocol , and com pleted the protocol -specified 8 weeks of fo llow-up after the last dose of study drug ) and had no major eligibilit y deviati ons or other m ajor protocol deviat ions in the POC study .

An y screening procedure for the OLE study must not be done until after completion of all the assessments an d procedures required by the POC protocol for the Day 85 POC Visit. bOLE enrollment will occur (at the earliest) on the same day as the patient’s last follow -up visit (Day 113 POC Visit) in the POC study. Any OLE assessment or procedure designated on the Day113 POC Visit must not be performed until after completion of all the assessments and procedures required by the POC protocol for the Day 113 POC Visit. If it is not feasible to complete any/all designated OLE assessments/procedures on the same day a sthe Day 113 POC Visit, or if there is a valid reason to delay enrollment of the patient in the OLE study, the Investigator can confir m the patient’s eligibility and enroll the patient at a later date as agreed between the Investigator and Medical Monitor ; however, depending on the length of the delay the patient may need to have an additional unscheduled blood draw for safety laboratory test ingtoconfirm eligibility for the OLE study. cOnly predose vital signs (but not physical examination, ECG, or safety laboratory testing) are required if the infusion isadministered in the home . Every other infusion (except those that fall ever y 12 weeks [Q12W]) may be administered in the home or at another location per the Infusion Manual, at the discretio n of the Inv estigator and if this option is made available to the site. As an example, for patients continuing on a Q4W regimen at Week 8, the schedule for optional home infusions would be as follows: Weeks 16, 28, and 4 0(assuming no M281 dose increase and assuming end of treatment at Week 52). As an example, f or patients switching to a Q2W regimen at Week 8, the schedule for optional home infusions would as follows: Weeks 14, 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, and 50 (assuming no M281 dose increase and assuming end of treatment at Week 52) dVital signs (temperature, recumbent systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, andpulse rate) will be measured immediately prior to the start of each infusion. For the first 2infusion sin the OLE study, vital signs wil l also be measure dafter completion of the infusion as specified in the Infusion Manual .Twelve -lead ECGs will be record edbefore the start of the M281 infusion . For the first infusion in the OLE study, a single 12-lead ECG will also be conducted within 1 0 minutes after the infusion has been completed .Predose ECGs will not be required o n day s when the infusion is administered in the home. eFull physical examinations to be performed at study enrollment and end of treatment/early termination ,and a focused p hysical exam ination at all other site visits. Focused physical examinations should determine if there has been any change in neurologic function, upper respiratory tract (ears, nose, throat, and sinuses), eyes and lungs, abdomen, or skin. fIf the M281 dos e and/or dosing frequency is increased (which must occur at a clinic visit , not at a home infusion ), the patient’s next infusion must be conducted in the clinic because a blood sample for safety laboratory testing must be obtained and a physical examinatio n must be done within 2 to 4weeks after the first infusion at the new dose/dosing frequency . gAll MGassessments must be done starting at approximately the same time of day , and prio r to study drug administration on infusion days. It is preferable to perform the applicable MG assessments in the order shown in this Schedule of Study Assessments. hBlood samples must be collected before the start of the M281 infusion. Safety laboratory testing i ncludes chemistry, hematology, coagulation function (including prothrombin time), and urinalysis . iThe assessment of patient eligibility for the OLE study includes review of the safety laboratory testing results from the pat ient’s Day 85 POC Visit. jWomen of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy te st at study enrollment prior to the first M281 infusion in the OLE study .

Severe infect ions and hypoalbuminemia (Grade 3 or higher according to the Commo n Termino logy Criteria f or Adverse Events [CTCAE] v5.0) will be considered AEs of special interest (AESIs) . 6.1.1 Adverse Events An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom , or disea se tem porally associated wi th the use of a drug, without any judgment about causalit y. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, disease, concurrent illness, or clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding that emerges or worsens (ie, aggravated in severit y or frequency from the baseline condit ion) during the study . Clinically significant abnormal results of laboratory tests or di agnost ic procedures are to be reported as AEs. The m anufacturer of the Embrace device advises that itshoul d only be worn on the surface of healt hy skin , and to suspend or discont inue use if the skin becomes red, itchy ,or if any pain is felt. Adverse events associated with wearing the Embrace device are to be recorded as device- related AEs and th e use of the Embrace device shoul d be discont inued. 6.1.1.1 Performing Adverse Events Assessments At each contact with the patient, the Invest igator or designee will capture AEs by specific questioning and, as appropriate, by examinat ion. Patients will be asked non-leading questions to capture medically related changes to their well -being. Participants will also be asked if they have been hospitalized, had any accidents, sought care from a healt h professio nal, used any new medicat ions/therapies, or changed concom itant m edicat ion regimens (both prescript ion and over -the-counter) due to an AE. 6.1.1.2 Timing Reporting of device -related AEs in the OLE study will start f ollowing the patient signing the OLE inform ed consent form .

The degree of certaint y about causalit y will be graded using the categories below: Definitely Related –There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship to study drug/device ;other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a pl ausible t ime relat ionship to study drug administration an d cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. The response to withdrawal of the study drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmaco logically or phenom enologically definit ive, wi th use of a satisf actory rechallenge procedure if necessary . Probably Related –There is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship to study drug /device , and the influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test resul t, occurs within a reasonable t ime after administration o f the study intervent ion, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and fo llows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechallenge inform ation is not required to fulfill this definit ion. Possibly Related –There is so me evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship to study drug/device (eg,the event occurred within a reasonable t ime after administration of the study drug). However, other factors may h ave contributed to the event ( eg, the patient’s clinical condi tion, other concomitant events). Although an AE may rate only as “possibly related” soon after discovery , it can be flagged as requiring more informat ion and later be upgraded to “probably related” or “definitely related”, as appropri ate. Unlikely to be related –A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test resul t, whose temporal relat ionship to study intervent ion administration makes a causal relationship"

Not Related –TheAE is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another eti ology. There must be an alternat ive, definit ive etio logy documented by the clinician . 6.1.1.5 Expectedness The Sponsor will be re sponsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severit y, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the Reference Safet y Informati on (the Invest igator’s Brochure for M281 and themanufacturers informat ion forthe Embrace device) . 6.1.1.6 Adverse Events of Special Interest For thi s study , any CTCAE Grade 3 or higher severe infect ionorevent of hypoalbuminemia will be considered an AESI. These cases will be handled similar lyto aserious adverse event (SAE )for reporti ng purposes (see Section 6.1.1.8 )and reviewed by the Drug Safety Moni toring Board (DSMB )as they occur . 6.1.1.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse Events Invest igators will indicate on the lab oratory report whether abnormal values are clinically significant ( CS)or not clinically significant (NCS). All CS abnormal laboratory resul ts will be considered as AEs and are to be reported in the electroni c case report form (eCRF ). 6.1.1.8 Serious Adverse Events DEFINITION An SAE is defined as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any o f the following outcom es:death, life -threatening AE, hospitalization or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizati on, a persistent or si gnificant di sabili ty/incapacit y, or a c ongenital ano maly/birth defect. Important m edical events that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospi talizati on may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardi ze the patient and may require m edical or surgi cal interventi on to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definit ion. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in inpatient hospitalizat ion, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse."

Clinical Trial Protocol : MOM-M281 -005 01August 2019 Confidential Page 40of 53Treatment with M281 may be interrupted after consultation wit h the Medical Monitor for the following events: •If a patient develops a CTCAE Grade 3infect ion, the Investigator may elect to withho ld M281 until the clinical scenario clarifies whether the infection is improving or getting worse . •If a patient develops 3+ pedal edema, ascites, or pleural or pericardial effusio ns, the Invest igator will monitor the pati ent’s condit ion. The decisio n to continue treatment or withhol d addi tional doses of M281 will be m ade by the Invest igator, in consultat ion with the Medi cal Monitor. •If a patient develops elevated CK levels, CK fract ionation (CK -MBisoenzym e, CK -MM isoenzyme ) and troponin will be autom atically tested by the laboratory . If the CK -MB or troponin level is elevated, the patient will be asked to go immediately to the emergency room for further evaluat ion. For any patient with elevated CK levels , addi tional assessments will be as fo llows: -CK elevat ions <5 ×ULN –further assessment can be made at the discret ion of the Invest igator. -CK elevat ions ≥5×ULN –the Invest igator will call the pat ient to inquire about excessive exercise, trauma, and any muscle or cardiac -related symptom s. The CK will be repeated and if there is a decrease, no action will be taken. However, if the CK is of similar or hi gher level , the patient will be asked to return to the clinic, where further invest igation will be done (in -depth clinical assessment, ECG, my oglobin in urine, repeat CK with fract ionationand troponin level , ALT , and AST). The decisio n to co ntinue treatment or withho ld addit ional doses of study drug for the pati ent will be made by the Invest igator, in consultat ion with the Medical Moni tor. 6.6.2 Study Stopping Rules •In the event of thedeath of a study patient, treatment will be held in all pat ients pending evaluat ion by the Sponsor and DSMB recommendation , and until approval is received by the applicable regulatory authori ty(ies) to resum e. •If a CTCAE Grade 4 event considered potentially related to treatm ent occurs, treatm ent will not be init iated in new pat ients(ie, enrollment in the extensio n study will be held), pending evaluat ion by the Sponsor and DSMB recommendat ion, and until approval is received by the applicable regulatory authori ty(ies) to resum e. •If a CTCAE Grade 3 or higher infect ion considered potentially related to treatment occurs in threeseparate patients, treatment will be temporarily held in all pat ients, pending evaluat ion by the Sponsor and DSMB recommendat ion, and until approval is received by the applicable regulatory authori ty(ies) to resum e.

Clinical Trial Protocol : MOM-M281 -005 01August 2019 Confidential Page 41of 536.7 Other Study Procedures Clinical Deterioration and Use of Rescue Therapy Study sites are requi red to e valuate a patient's report of clinical deterioration wit hin 48 hours of the pati ent notifying the Invest igator of the onset or worsening of symptoms of gMG. Clinical deterioration is defined as any of the fo llowing : •An MG crisis, defined as MG -related wea kness sufficient ly severe to necessitate intubation, or requi res noninvasive ventilat ion to avo id int ubation,or woul d be severe enough to delay extubat ion following surgery (Sander set al, 2016) , with the respi ratory failure being due to weakness of respiratory muscles. Severe bulbar (oropharyngeal) muscle weakness may acco mpan ythe respi ratory muscle weakness or may be the predominant feature in so me pat ients. •Significant symptomat ic worsening on any MG -ADL i tem of 3ormore point s,excluding doubl e visi on or ey elid droop (i e, tal king, chewing, swallowing, breathing, upper and lower extremit y weakness). •Any pat ient whom the Invest igator believes will jeopardize his/her health if MG rescue therapy is not given (eg, emerge nt situations). Depending on the severit y of worsening of MG -related symptom s, rescue therapy (eg,glucocorticosteroids, IVIG, plasmapheresis) will be permitted, as per the clinical judgment of the Invest igator. If a p atientreceives rescue therapy , the Invest igator and Medical Monitor will j ointly determine whether to continue treatment with M281 or withdraw the pati entfrom the study . 6.8 Appropriateness of Measurements The efficacy scales in this study have been shown to be reliable and valid for measuring clinical status of patients with MG. The use of the wearable Embrace device for quantifying physical act ivity is being explored for potential use in later studies. The routine safety assessments included in this study are standard for Phase 2 clinical s tudies in pat ients.The PD bi omarkers being studi ed are rel evant for patients with MG based on scient ificliterature and clinical pract ice. Although preclinical studies and the first -in-human study with M281 did not indicate any central nervous system effects, t he C-SSRS will be used in this study as an addit ional safet y assessment based on the recommend ationby the United States Food and Drug Administrati on (US FDA )for all clinical trials involving the development of drugs or biologics for neurologic ind icationsto assess suicide risk . The US FDA has provided guidance to prospectively assess suicidal ideat ion and behavior in clinical trials to ensure that patients in clinical trials who are experiencing suicidal ideat ion and behavior are properly recogni zed and adequately treated and to ensure the collect ion of more timely and more complete data on suicidal ideat ion and behavior than have been collected in the past (US FDA, 2012 )."
