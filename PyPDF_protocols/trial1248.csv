Secondary Objectives:  To evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of blinatumomab  To evaluate the effect of blinatumomab on overall survival (OS)  To evaluate the relapse-free survival (RFS) induced by blinatumomab  To evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD) response induced by blinatumomab  To evaluate the incidence of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) and 100-day mortality following HSCT in blinatumomab treated subjects  To estimate the effect of blinatumomab on patient reported outcomes of global health status/quality of life (QoL) using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). Safety Objective:  To evaluate the safety of blinatumomab in Chinese subjects with relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL Exploratory Objectives:  To evaluate central nervous system ( CNS ) symptoms and explore potential predictive factors for CNS events associated with blinatumomab Hypotheses: The clinical hypothesis is that blinatumomab will have clinically meaningful anti-tumor activity better than 30% as measured by CR/CRh* rate within 2 cycles in Chinese adult subjects with relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL. The anticipated CR/CRh* rate of blinatumomab within 2 cycles will be 45%. Primary Endpoint:  CR/CRh* rate within 2 cycles of treatment with blinatumomab Secondary Endpoints:  CR rate within 2 cycles of treatment with blinatumomab  CR/CRh*/CRi (complete remission with incomplete hematological recovery) rate within 2 cycles of treatment with blinatumomab  PK parameters  OS  RFS  MRD response rate within 2 cycles of treatment with blinatumomab  Proportion of subjects undergoing alloHSCT among those who achieved CR/CRh* after treatment with blinatumomab Approved"

The study will consist of a screening period, a treatment period, and a follow-up period. Treatment will consist of up to 5 cycles of blinatumomab (for details see Section 6.2.2 ). Subjects who have achieved a bone marrow (BM) response (≤ 5% BM blasts) or CR/CRh*/CRi within 2 induction cycles of treatment may continue to receive up to 3 additional consolidation cycles of blinatumomab. Thirty days (± 3 days) after end of the last dose of protocol-specified therapy, subjects will have a safety follow- up (SFU) visit. Following this, there will be long term (efficacy/survival) follow-up portion of the study for disease status and OS. Subjects will be followed via clinic visit or telephone contact every 3 months (± 1 month) after their SFU visit until death has been observed or a maximum of 2 years after start of treatment, whichever occurs first. If subjects are suitable for alloHSCT after treatment with blinatumomab, they may undergo alloHSCT instead of receiving further consolidation cycles with blinatumomab. It is recommended to administer at least 2 cycles of blinatumomab before alloHSCT. The subjects should complete the SFU visit before undergoing a transplant, and these subjects will continue to be followed in the long -term follow-up phase of the study. In order to enroll representative and balanced adult ALL subjects in terms of the number of prior salvage treatments, the study requires that approximately 50% of subjects are receiving salvage treatment for the first time. Salvage treatment will be categorized in the Interactive Voice Response/Interactive Web Response system (IVRS/IWRS) in order to monitor the number of subjects enrolled in each category. Subjects will be categorized to: (a) those expecting to receive blinatumomab as a first salvage treatment or (b) those expecting to receive blinatumomab as a second or greater salvage treatment . Sample Size: Approximately 120 Chinese adult subjects with relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL. Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria: This study will enroll Chinese adult subjects with R/R B-precursor ALL with any of the following:  primary refractory after induction therapy or who had relapse within 12 months of first remission, or  relapsed within 12 months of receiving alloHSCT, or  relapsed or refractory after first salvage therapy or beyond Approved"

For a full list of eligibility criteria, please refer to Section 4.1.1 through Section 4.1.2 . Investigational Product Amgen Investigational Product Dosage and Administration: Blinatumomab is administered as a continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI). A single cycle of blinatumomab treatment is 6 weeks in duration, which includes 4 weeks of blinatumomab CIVI followed by a 2 week treatment-free interval. The treatment-free interval may be prolonged by up to 7 days, if deemed necessary by the investigato r. In the first induction cycle, the initial dose of blinatumomab will be 9 μg/day for the first 7 days of treatment (to mitigate for potential cytokine release syndrome ( CRS ) and CNS events associated with introduction to blinatumomab) which then will be escalated (dose step) to 28 μg/day starting on day 8 (week 2) through day 29 (week 4). For all subsequent cycles (beginning with the second induction cycle and continuing through consolidation, for applicable subjects) 28 μg/day will be the dose for all 4 weeks of continuous treatment. Non-investigational Product Non-Amgen Non-investigational Product Dosage and Administration: Dexamethasone Procedures: At specified time points as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments, subjects will undergo the following procedures : collection of informed consent, medical history, demographics, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status ( PS), complete neurological examination, physical exam including height, weight, vital signs and temperature, lumbar puncture and a BM aspirate. Subjects will provide samples for hematology with differential, blood chemistry profiles, urinalysis, and anti-blinatumomab antibodies. Subjects will further provide samples for other specialty labs including lymphocyte subsets, quantitative immunoglobulins, PK samples, and a serum or urine pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential. Research staff will document the use of concomitant medications and all adverse events reported by the subject. During the treatment phase of the study, subjects will also provide patient reported outcomes (EORTC QLQ-C30 ). For a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to Section 7 and the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 9 ). Statistical Considerations: General Approach Primary analysis will be performed when all the enrolled subjects have finished at least 2 cycles of blinatumomab and the SFU visit (if subjects discontinue treatment after 2 cycles), or have discontinued the treatment of blinatumomab and complete the SFU visit, whichever occurs first. The primary analysis of efficacy and safety will be performed on all enrolled subjects who received at least one infusion of blinatumomab (Primary Analysis Set [PAS]). Final analysis will be performed at the end of the study when all the enrolled subjects have finished all the follow-up visits or have withdrawn from the study, whichever occurs first. The analyses of RFS, OS, alloHSCT rate after achieving CR/CRh*, and safety will be updated. The binomial endpoints including CR/CRh* rate, CR rate, CR/CRh*/CRi rate, alloHSCT rate, and MRD response rate will be calculated and the exact binomial 95% confidence interval will be generated for the response rate. The time- to-event endpoints including RFS and OS will be summarized with hazard ratio, Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves, KM quartiles (when estimable), the number of subjects with events, the number of subjects censored, and the pattern of censoring. Sample Size Considerations The overall sample size of 120 subjects, calculated using the exact method for a single proportion,was estimated in order to ensure 90% power to detect a significant difference in terms Approved"

Interim Analyses One interim analysis is planned when 75% of subjects (90 subjects) have had the opportunity to be treated with at least 2 cycles of blinatumomab and to finish the SFU visit. The interim analysis will assess blinatumomab efficacy and safety. The efficacious benefit assessment will be based on an O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function with the critical boundary 42.2% at the interim analysis and 39.2 % at the primary analysis in CR/CRh* rate . If the interim analysis shows a statistically efficacious benefit assessment and an overall benefit-risk analysis that is promising, then the interim analysis will become the primary analysis of this study. In addition, the study will still continue its enrollment until 120 subjects are enrolled and continue to complete the protocol specified procedures. Additional ad hoc Interim Analyse s may be performed. Pharmacokinetic samples collected at specific timepoints may be analyzed and reported. The purpose of this additional interim data analyses is to provide descriptive analyses of PK, safety, and efficacy information (including 95% confidence intervals) for regulatory submissions and interactions.

OBJECTIVES 1.1 Primary  To evaluate the rate of hematological response (complete remission/complete remission with partial hematological recovery [CR/CRh*]) induced by blinatumomab in Chinese adult subjects with relapsed/refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). 1.2 Secondary  To evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of blinatumomab  To evaluate the effect of blinatumomab on overall survival (OS)  To evaluate the relapse-free survival (RFS) induced by blinatumomab  To evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD) response induced by blinatumomab  To evaluate the incidence of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) and 100-day mortality following HSCT in blinatumomab treated subjects  To estimate the effect of blinatumomab on patient reported outcomes of global health status/quality of life (QoL) using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). 1.3 Safety  To evaluate the safety of blinatumomab in Chinese subjects with relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL 1.4 Exploratory  To evaluate central nervous system ( CNS ) symptoms and explore potential predictive factors for CNS events associated with blinatumomab 2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 2.1 Disease Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a heterogeneous hematologic disease characterized by the proliferation of immature lymphoid cells in the bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood. Normal blood cell development in the marrow is therefore arrested and replaced with immature and abnormal lymphoblasts. The proliferation of these immature/abnormal lymphoid cells in the BM subsequently crowd out the production of normal BM elements ultimately resulting in decreased red blood cell, white blood cell and platelet counts ( NCCN Practice Guidelines, 2014 ). ALL is a rare malignant disease with an overall incidence of 1.1/100,000 per year worldwide. ALL has a bimodal distribution with an early peak at 4 to 5 years of age (incidence of 4.5/100,000 per year) followed by a second gradual increase at 50 years (incidence of 2/100,000 per year). It represents 80% of acute childhood leukemia and 20% of acute leukemia cases in adults ( Pui and Evans 1998; Jabbour et al, 2005; Approved"
16,page_16,"Product: Blinatumomab Protocol Number: 20130316 Date: 09 March 2020 Page 17 of 105 CONFIDENTIAL Larson, 2005 ). In China, there are no national l evel epidemiology data for the incidence rate of ALL. The average incidence rate of ALL in Shanghai from 2002 to 2006 was 0.81/100,000 per year, the same as that in Nanjing from 2003 to 2007 ( Ni Xiong, 2011; Baoan Chen, 2010 ). 2.2 Definition of Relapsed/ Refractory Disease The population that this study will recruit is adult subjects w ith relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-precursor ALL. Primary refractory ALL is defined by absence of CR after standard induction therapy. A patient has relapsed ALL if they achieved a CR during upfront therapy (CR1) and has then relapsed during, or after continuation of therapy. A similar classification is possible for salvage therapy. Refractory relapse is defined by lack of CR after first salvage therapy. Second relapse or later relapses are defined as relapse after achieving a second complete remission (CR2) in first salvage or later salvage therapies. These definitions are important for clinical trials of new therapeutic agents, which are in some cases tailored to recruit subjects in specific situations; for example, second or early first relapse ( Gökbuget and Hoelzer, 2011 ). 2.3 Prognostic Factors The classic prognostic features at the time of newly diagnosed B-precursor ALL are age at diagnosis, white blood cell count (WBC), an d time to complete remission following induction chemotherapy. A younger age (depending on level of risk, below 25 and 35 years of age) and WBC of < 30,000/µL at diagnosis are favorable factors in adult ALL. Additionally, a short interval in the achievem ent of a CR (< 3 weeks) is also favorable ( Gökbuget and Hoelzer, 2009 ). The detection of MRD (the presence of a low number of leukemic cells that are not detectable by light microscopy) after induction therapy and/or consolidation therapy is an independent prognostic factor for poor outcome of ALL. Subjects highly responsive to chemotherapy with a MRD-level below 1 x 10-4 leukemic cells detectable induced by induction treatment, have a favorable prognosis. Subjects whose MRD persists during induction and consolidation of front-line treatment or who become MRD-positive following treatment, have a poor leukemia free survival. Approved"

Prognostic Factors For Risk Stratification of Adult ALL (Gökbuget and Hoelzer, 2009 ) Parameter Favorable Adverse (B -Lineage) Age at time of diagnosis < 25 years, < 35 years ≥ 35 yrs > 55 yrs, > 70 yrs WBC at time of diagnosis < 30,000/µL > 30,000/µL Time to CR following 1st line treatment Early Late (> 3 -4 weeks) MRD following receipt of induction therapy Negative (< 10-4 leukemic cells detectable ) Positive (> 10-4 leukemic cells detectable ) Prognostic Factors After Relapse and Treatment For subjects at a lower age, refractory disease or early relapse during upfront treatment (compared with late relapse after upfront treatment or during maintenance therapy) are important factors for treatment selection. In the former group of subjects, experimental drug combinations have to be applied, whereas in the latter group of subjects, repeated induction therapy is the treatment of choice. Subjects at a higher age have a significantly worse long-term prognosis than subjects at lower age. This is mainly caused by poor tolerability of chemotherapy toxicities leading to higher mortality and morbidity, and the necessity of dose reduction. Furthermore, elderly subjects rarely fulfill the requirements for alloHSCT in CR. In subjects who relapse after alloHSCT, less intensive treatments may be preferable. In subjects who relapse during intensive chemotherapy, it is of no use to repeat administration of the same regimens ( Gökbuget and Hoelzer, 2011 ). Treatment Results After Relapse Three study groups have published retrospective analyses of clinical trials in adult subjects with ALL in first relapse. All results are summarized in Table 2 . The French group published an overall CR rate of 44% in 421 adult subjects in first relapse after various regimens. The median OS was 6 months with 8% OS at 5 years. In this analysis the only prognostic factor for OS was transplantation of any type (Tavernier et al, 2007 ). The Spanish Programa Para El Tratamiento de Hemopatias Malignas (PETHEMA) reported the outcome for 198 adult subjects in first relapse after chemotherapy or HSCT. The overall CR rate after various treatment approaches was 42%. The CR rate in Approved"

The median OS after relapse was 4.5 months. Age and duration of first remission were significantly associated with disease-free survival and OS (Oriol et al, 2010 ). The MD Anderson group published an overall CR rate of 31% in 314 adult subjects in first relapse after a variety of salvage regimens. The median OS was 6 months and the OS at 5 years was 6%. In a multivariate regression model for survival, age and durati on of first remission were identified as significant factors ( Thomas et al, 1999 ). In another study the complete remission rate was also 31% and the median survival was 5 months (Kantarjian et al, 2010 ). Table 2.

The CR rate reported for second salvage was 18% and thus lower than the CR rate reported for first salvage therapy. The median OS was only 3 months. The type of regimen significantly influenced the outcome, being more favorable after salvage regimens based on hyper-CVAD (hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone), high-dose cytarabine, or direct alloHSCT ( O´Brien et al, 2008 ). Various publications with single agents after at least 2 regimens in adult and pediatric subjects reported similar CR rates ( Jeha et al, 2006; Berg et al, 2005; DeAngelo et al, 2007; O’Brien et al, 2010 ).

Hyper-CVAD regimen, high dose cytarabine and anthracycline combination, FLAG (fludarabine, cytarabine, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), methotrexate combined with asparaginase and similar regimens are possibilities as salvage therapy for first or later relapse. The best re-induction strategy remains to be determined. Five study groups in China have published the results of retrospective study in adult subjects with ALL. The results are summarized in Table 4 . Most of the adult ALL subjects were treated as first salvage therapy. Dr.Liu’s retrospective study is the only multicenter study . In total, 268 relapsed or refractory ALL subjects were enrolled . The published CR for CAG [aclarubicin (ACR), cytarabine (Ara-C) , and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)] group, high dose CAG (HD-CAG) group and Hyper-CVAD are 45.45%, 51.85%, and 52.56% , respectively . Each group had nearly 20-30% subjects younger than 18 years old. Among all the groups, there were no statistically significant differences with CR and OR rates except for CAG group in B-ALL ( Liu et al, 2015). Liu’s group retrospectively compared the efficacy of FLAG (with VDLP (vincristine, daunorubicin, L-asparaginase and prednisone) or Idarubicin (IDA) combined regimens in first salvage ALL subjects. The CR for FLAG group and VDLP/IDA group were 40% and 35% respectively, median disease free survival (DFS) for CR subjects in each group were 6 months and 4 months ; and median OS for CR subjects in each group were 11 months and 9 months ( Liu et al. 2013).

The major goal of relapse treatment is the induction of a second CR with sufficient duration to prepare for alloHSCT. Thus all attempts (including experimental drugs) should be made to obtain a second CR and then conduct alloHSCT (Gökbuget and Hoelzer, 2011 ). Subjects eligible for alloHSCT always represent a selected group, who have to survive at least as long as the donor search is conducted. Salvage chemotherapy should be administered before alloHSCT, in order to reduce tumor load (Gökbuget and Hoelzer, 2011). In the MRC UK study, 120 subjects (20%) were eligible to undergo an alloHSCT after relapse, either autologous (n = 13), matched unrelated (n = 65), or matched related (n = 42). Survival rates after 2 years were 15% for auto graft, 16% for unrelated and 23% for sibling HSCT ( Fielding et al, 2007 ). Approved"
21,page_21,"Product: Blinatumomab Protocol Number: 20130316 Date: 09 March 2020 Page 22 of 105 CONFIDENTIAL The French group identified alloHSCT in second CR as favorable prognosti c factor for OS. Five-year survival after alloHSCT was 25% ( Tavernier et al, 2007 ). In the Dr. Liu’s retrospective study, the subjects who underwent alloHSCT, the estimated 3-years OS in CAG, HD-CAG, hyper-CVAD groups were 20.9% ± 7.5%, 18.4% ± 5.5%, and 29.0% ± 3.8%, respectively (Liu et al, 2015 ). Treatment and Prevention of Extramedullary Relapse A small fraction of relapses in adult subjects with ALL have an extramedullary location, for example in the CNS or testes. In contrast to childhood ALL, the outcome for extramedullary relapse in adult subjects with ALL is not different from medullary relapse (Tavernier et al, 2007; Fielding et al, 2007 ). If the relapse is treated only locally for example by intrathecal therapy, the extramedullary relapse is usually followed by medullary relapse. Therefore extramedullary relapse of ALL should always be considered as systemic disease and local therapy such as intrathecal treatment of CNS relapse should be combined with systemic chemotherapy. In subjects with medullary relapse CNS prophylaxis should be administered ( Gökbuget and Hoelzer, 2011). 2.4 Blinatumomab Background Blinatumomab is a murine recombinant single-chain antibody construct combining both the binding specificity for the pan B-cell antigen CD19 and the epsilon chain of the T-cell receptor/CD3 complex on one polypeptide chain. It is monomeric, not glycosylated and weighs approximately 55 kDa. It belongs to a new class of bispecific antibody constructs called bispecific T-cell engagers (BITE). Bispecific T-cell engagers have been designed to direct T-effector memory cells towards target cells. The proximity induced by the BITE® triggers target cell-specific cytotoxicity, which closely resembles standard cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation. This T-cell–mediated target-specific killing is the therapeutic mechanism of action of blinatumomab (Löffler et al, 2000; Wolf et al, 2005 ). Blinatumomab specifically targets cells that express CD19, a marker solely expressed by B cells, including B-precursor ALL cells, with an affinity of 1.49 x 10-9 M. Blinatumomab recruits and activates T cells via a lower affinity interaction with CD3 (KD = 2.6 x 10-7 M). These activated T cells then induce a half-maximal target cell lysis ranging in vitro within a range of 1 to 1000 pg/mL (0.018 -18 pM), showing blinatumomab to be an extremely potent molecule ( Dreier et al, 2002 ). Approved"
22,page_22,"Product: Blinatumomab Protocol Number: 20130316 Date: 09 March 2020 Page 23 of 105 CONFIDENTIAL During the course of tumor cell elimination, activated T cells synthesize and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)- 6, and IL -2, which might induce symptoms such as fever or decreases of blood pressure. In vitro data demonstrate cytokine release as a result of blinatumomab -mediated activation, which can be attenuated by corticosteroids without impairing the cytotoxic activity. In vivo data indicate cytokine release to be most prominent following the first dose of blinatumomab. Figure 2 . Mode of Action of Blinatumomab Due to its unique ability to redirect T cells via CD3 towards a CD19+ tumor cell lysis, blinatumomab can elicit repeated target cell elimination by cytotoxic T cells and a polyclonal response of previously primed CD4+ and C8+ T cells. The antitumor activity is effective within a wide range of effector to target (E:T) ratios. In the absence of CD19+ target cells neither cytotoxicity nor release of cytokines will occur. Blinatumomab acts strictly in a target cell specific and dependent manner, with regard to cytotoxic action. The presence of both CD19+ target cells and T cells are required for its cytotoxic activity. In December 2014, blinatumomab was approved by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of subjects with Phila delphia chromosome-negative (Ph-negative) relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL under accelerated approval. The blinatumomab approval is based on results of Study MT103-211, a p hase 2, multicenter, single-arm open-label study (see Section 2.5.2 ).

Blinatumomab was administered by continuous intravenous ( IV) infusion (CIVI) for 4 weeks followed by a 2 week treatment-free interval per cycle. The primary endpoint was the hematologic CR rate within 2 cycles of treatment with blinatumomab. A hematologic CR was defined as a CR or a CR with partial hematological recovery (CRh*) within 2 cycles of blinatumomab treatment. Complete remission was defined as: less than or equal to 5% blasts in the BM, no evidence of disease, and full recovery of peripheral blood counts (platelets > 100.000/μL, hemoglobin [Hb ] ≥ 11 g/dL, and absolute neutrophil count [ANC] > 1.500/μL). Complete remission with only partial hematological recovery (CRh*) was defined as: less than or equal to 5% blasts in the BM, no other evidence of disease, and partial recovery of peripheral blood counts (platelets > 50.000/μL, Hb ≥ 7 g/dL, and ANC > 500/μL). In Study MT103-206, 36 adult subjects with R/R B-precursor ALL were treated in this study, 7 subjects in Dose Cohort 1 (15 μg/m²/day), 5 subjects in Dose Cohort 2a (5-15 μg/m²/day), 6 subjects in Dose Cohort 2b (5-15-30 μg/m²/day), and 18 subjects in Dose Cohort 3 (5-15 μg/m²/day). The overall median age was 32 years (range: 18 - 77 years); 14 were female, and 22 were male. Thirty-three subjects (92.0%) in this study had relapsed ALL. Three subjects had refractory disease. Two subjects (6.0%) were Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph-positive) , and 4 subjects (11.0%) had a t(4;11) translocation. Fifteen subjects had undergone prior alloHSCT. Twenty-five subjects (69%) responded to treatment. Fifteen subjects (42%) and 10 subjects (28%) showed a CR and CRh*, respectively, within 2 cycles of blinatumomab treatment.

The primary endpoint of thi s study is the hematologic CR/CRh* rate within 2 cycles of treatment with blinatumomab. This prespecified endpoint was met if > 30% of subjects achieved a CR/CRh* during this time interval. Subjects who have achieved CR or CRh* within 2 cycles of treatment can receive up to 3 additional cycles of maintenance treatment or proceed to BM transplantation. Key efficacy endpoints include RFS, duration of co mplete remission, proportion of subjects eligible for alloHSCT who undergo the procedure after blinatumomab treatment, and rate of MRD response (defined as MRD < 1 x 10-4 leukemic cells detectable measured by PCR) within 2 cycles of blinatumomab treatment.

Overall, most subjects were men (63.0%) and white (85.8%), with a median age (range) of 39 years (range 18 to 79 years). Approximately 41% of subjects received blinatumomab as thi rd-line treatment, and 39% received it as fourth-line or greater; the remaining 20% of subjects were either primary refractory or had relapsed within 12 months of first remission. One-hundred thirty subjects (68.8%) had a BM blast count of 50% at baseline based on central laboratory assessments. In the PAS, the rate of CR/CRh* within the first 2 treatment cycles was 42.9% (81/189; 95% CI: 35.7, 50.2). Since the lower bound of the 95% CI was > 30%, the remission rate was significantly greater than 30%. The best response rates including the rates of CR/CRh* during the first 2 cycles are provided in Table 6 . Three subjects who had achieved a CRh* response at the end of 2 cycles of treatment converted to CR by the end of the core study and one subject converted from a non-response to a CR, resulting in an overall CR rate of 35.4% for the core study.

Safety results from studies MT103-206 and MT103 -211: As of the safety data cut-off date (10 October 2013), 225 subjects (189 in Study MT103-211 and 36 in Study MT103 -206) were exposed t o blinatumomab in the adult relapsed/refractory ALL population. By study, the median exposure duration was 42.2 days (range 1.2, 150.1) in Study MT103-211, and 55.6 days (range 24.15, 77.3) across dose groups in Study MT103-206. The longest median duration of exposure was 75.15 days (6 subjects) in the 5/15/30 μg/m2/d dose group in Study MT103-206. Of the 225 subjects in the adult relapsed/refractory ALL studies, 70.4% (133/189) of subjects in Study MT103-211 and 69.4% (25/36) of subjects in Study MT103 -206 started and completed at least 1 cycle of treatment. In Study MT103-211, the mean number of started treatment cycles was 2.0 (SD 1.2) and the mean number of completed treatment cycles was 1.4 (SD 1.4). In Study MT103-206 the mean number of started tre atment cycles was 2.5 (SD 1.7), and the mean number of completed cycles was 1.6 (SD 1.5). Almost all subjects (224/225 [99.6%]) experienced at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event . Across the 2 studies, the subject incidence of grade ≥ 3 treatment-em ergent adverse events was 80.9% (182/225); by study the subject incidence of grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events was 82% in Study MT103-211 and 75% in Study MT103 -206. The subject incidence of grade ≥ 4 treatment-emergent adverse events across the 2 studies was 44.9% Approved"

Across studies the subject incidence of serious adverse events was 64.9% (146/225), and fatal treatment-emergent adverse events were reported in 15.1% of subjects (34/225). By study, the subject incidences of serious adverse events and fatal treatment-emergent adverse events were similar in Studies MT103-211 and MT103-206 ( serious adverse events: 64% and 69.4%, respectively; fatal treatment-emergent adverse event s: 14.8% and 16.7%, respectively). The subject incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation was lower in MT103-211 (18.0%) compared with MT103-206 (27.8%). The System Organ Classes (SOC) with the highest subject incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events across both studies was Infections and Infestations (5.3% [12/225]), and as anticipated, sepsis was the PT with the highest reported subject incidence. Across both studies, events that led to treatment discontinuation that occurred in ≥ 2 subjects included disease progression, sepsis, aspartate aminotransferase ( AST) increased, blood alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increased, muscular weakness, acute ALL, ence phalopathy, headache, tremor, disorientation, and respiratory failure. The subject incidence of treatment -emergent adverse event s leading to study drug interruption was the same in each study (33.3%). Subjects receiving blinatumomab may experience a spectrum of neurologic and psychiatric events, such as seizure, encephalopathy, tremor, apraxia, speech disorders (aphasia, dysarthria), and disorientation. The incidence of subjects experiencing neurologic and psychiatric events is greatest within the first few days of blinatumomab treatment. 2.5.3 Blinatumomab Data in Asian Subjects To date, the development of blinatumomab has been f ocused on Europe and the United States. At the time of this protocol writing, a global phase 3 blinatumomab study (TOWER) and a phase 1b/2 study in Japanese subjects are currently ongoing in Asia ; therefore , data are not yet available for Asian subjects from this study. In the pivotal phase 2 MT103-211 study, 7 Asian subjects were enrolled in the United States and Europe, of which 5 subjects had evaluable PK samples. These subjects received blinatumomab at 9 µg/day during the first week and 28 µg/day for the remaining treatment time. Data are currently limited, however the safety profile and PK profile in Asian subjects and non-Asian subjects appear to be comparable. Approved"
28,page_28,"Product: Blinatumomab Protocol Number: 20130316 Date: 09 March 2020 Page 29 of 105 CONFIDENTIAL 2.6 Rationale Relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL in adult subjects is an aggressive malignant disease with dismal prognosis. Several studies have reported long term survival to be below 10%. Major prognostic factors are duration of CR1 and age. With current salvage chemotherapy, CR rate is low (20 to 30%) in subjects in first salvage with short duration (< 1 year) of first remission, subjects relapsed after first salvage, or subjects aged 60 years and older. Duration of CR is usually very short (median DFS: 2.0-7.5 months). AlloHSCT may provide a curative treatment option for subjects in CR with a satisfactory donor and appropriate clinical status including age, organ function, and remission status. AlloHSCT is not an option in most elderly subjects with relapsed ALL (for all data see Gökbuget and Hoelzer 2011 ). Additional therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Blinatumomab belongs to a new class of bispecific antibody derivatives called BITE. BITEs have been designed to direct T cells towards target cells. Blinatumomab has demonstrated efficacy and safety in two phase 2 studies (MT 103-206 and MT 103 -211) in adult subjects with Ph-negative B-precursor relapsed/refractory ALL. Blinatumomab is the first FDA-approved bispecific CD19-directed CD3 T-cell engager (BiTE®) antibody construct product, and the first single-agent immunotherapy has been approved for the treatment of subjects with Ph-negative relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor ALL. Blinatumomab also has the potential to provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to Chinese subjects compared with existing treatments for this patient population. 2.7 Clinical Hypotheses The clinical hypothesis is that blinatumomab will have clinically meaningful anti-tumor activity better than 30% as measured by CR/CRh* rate within 2 cycles in Chinese adult subjects with relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL. The anticipated CR/C Rh* rate within 2 cycles will be 45%. 3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN 3.1 Study Design This is an open label, single-arm, multicenter phase 3 study to evaluate efficacy and safety of the BiTE antibody blinatumomab in Chinese adult subjec ts with relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL. The study will consist of a screening period, a treatment period, and a follow -up period. Treatment will consist of up to 5 cycles of blinatumomab (for details see Section 6.2.2 ). Approved"
29,page_29,"Product: Blinatumomab Protocol Number: 20130316 Date: 09 March 2020 Page 30 of 105 CONFIDENTIAL Subjects who have achieved a BM response (≤ 5% BM blasts) or CR/CRh*/CRi within 2 induction cycles of treatment may continue to receive up to 3 additional consolidation cycles of blinatumomab. Thirty days (± 3 days) after end of the last dose of protocol-specified therapy, subjects will have a safety follow-up (SFU) visit. Following this, there will be long term (efficacy/survival) follow-up portion of the study for disease status and OS. Subjects will be followed via clinic visit or telephone contact every 3 months (± 1 month ) after their SFU visit until death has been observed or a maximum of 2 years after start of treatment, whichever occurs first. If subjects are suitable for alloHSCT after treatment with blinatumomab, they may undergo alloHSCT instead of receiving further consolidation cycles with blinatumomab. It is recommended to administer at least 2 cycles of blinatumomab before alloHSCT. The subjects should complete the SFU visit before undergoing a transplant, and these subjects will continue to be followed in the long -term fol low-up phase of the study. In order to enroll representative and balanced adult ALL subjects in terms of the number of prior salvage treatments, the study requires that approximately 50% of subjects are receiving salvage treatment for the first time. Salvage treatment will be categorized in the interactive voice response system/interactive web response system (IVRS/IWRS) in order to monitor the number of subjects enrolled in each category. Subjects will be categorized to: (a) those expecting to receive blinatumomab as a first salvage treatment or (b) those expecting to receive blinatumomab as a second or greater salvage treatment. The overall study design is described by a study schema (Figure 1 ) at the end of the protocol synopsis section. The study endpoints are defined in Section 10.1.1 . 3.2 Number of Sites Approximately 25 centers located in China will participate in this study. During the conduct of the study, additional sites may be added as necessary. Sites that do not enroll subjects within 6 months of site initiation may be considered for closure to further participation in the trial. Approved"

A cycle consists of a CIVI over 4 weeks followed by a treatment free interval of 2 weeks. Thirty days (± 3 days) after end of the last dose of protocol-specified therapy, subjects will have a SFU visit. Following this, there will be long term (efficacy/survival) follow-up portion of the study for disease status and OS (24 months [± 2 weeks]) after treatment start or until death, whichever occurs first. For subjects who complete the protocol from the date of first dose through the long-term follow-up period, the entire duration of the study will take approximately 24 months to complete. However, individual study duration will vary depending on the need for consolidation treatment with blinatumomab and survival of an individual subject. The entire duration of this study including recruitme nt, screening, treatment, SFU, and long-term follow-up will take approximately 54 months. 3.5.2 End of Study Primary Completion: The primary completion date is defined as the date when the last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for the final collection of data for the primary endpoint(s).

SUBJECT ENROLLMENT Before subjects begin participation in any study-specific activities/procedures, Amgen requires a copy of the site’s written institutional review board/independent ethics committee (IRB/IEC) approval of the protocol, informed consent form (ICF) , and all other subject information and/or recruitment material, if applicable (see Section 11.2). A written main study ICF must be signed and personally dated by the subject or by the subject’s legally acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion before any protocol specified procedure is performed. Each subject who enters into the screening period for the study (defined as the point when the subject or the subject’s legally acceptable representative signs the IRB/IEC approved main study ICF) receives a unique subject identification number before any study-related activities/procedures are performed. The subject identification number will be assigned by the IVRS/IWRS. This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the clinical s tudy and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject. The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is rescreened. A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met all eligibility criteria, and has entered enrollment into the IVRS/IWR S. The investigator is to document this decision and date in the subject’s medical record and in/ on the enrollment electronic case report form (eCRF). During the enrollment call, the subject will be categorized to: (a) those expecting to receive blinatumomab as a first salvage treatment or (b) those expecting to receive blinatumomab as a second or greater salvage treatment. 5.1 Randomization/Treatment Assignment This is an open-label, non-randomized study.

TREATMENT PROCEDURES 6.1 Classification of Product(s) and/or Medical Device(s) The Amgen Investigational Product (IP) used in this study is blinatumomab. The Investigational Product Instruction Manual (IPIM), a document external to this protocol, containing detailed information regarding the storage, preparation, and administration of blinatumomab will be provided to each investigational site. All other protoc ol-specified therapies including, pre-phase therapies, that are commercially available are not provided or reimbursed by Amgen (except if required by local regulation). The Investigator will be responsible for obtaining supplies of these protocol-specified therapies. 6.2 Investigational Product 6.2.1 Amgen Investigational Product Blinatumomab will be manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma Gmbh & Co KG and packaged by Amgen and distributed using Amgen clinical study drug distribution procedures. Blinatumomab will be supplied as single-use glass injection vials as a sterile, preservative-free, white to off-white, lyophilized powder for reconstitution and administration by IV infusion. Each vial contains blinatumomab with additional excipients and buffers including citric acid monohydrate, trehalose dihydrate, lysine hydrochloride and polysorbate 80, pH 7. To prepare blinatumomab for IV infusion, the lyophilized powder is reconstituted with sterile water for injection. The reconstituted solution is added to an infusion bag containing 0.9% NaCl and a product-specific stabilizer (IV Solution Stabilizer). The IV solution stabilizer functions to prevent adsorption of blinatumomab to surfaces of the infusion components. The IV Solution Stabilizer is supplied in a single-use glass injection vials as a sterile, preservative-free, clear, colorless-to -slightly-yellow liquid concentrate. Sterile water for injection and supplies required for reconstitution and injection of blinatumomab will not be provided to clinical sites.

A single cycle of blinatumomab treatment is 6 weeks in duration, which includes 4 weeks of blinatumomab CIVI followed by a 2 week treatment-free interval. The treatment -free interval may be prolonged by up to 7 days, if deemed necessary by the investigator. In the first induction cycle, the initial dose of blinatumomab will be 9 μg/day for the first 7 days of treatment (to mitigate for potential cytokine release syndrome [ CRS] and CNS events associated with introduction to blinatumomab) which then will be esc alated (dose step) to 28 μg/day starting on day 8 (week 2) through day 29 (week 4). For all subsequent cycles (beginning with the second induction cycle and continuing through consolidation, for applicable subjects) 28 μg/day will be the dose for all 4 weeks of continuous treatment . The drug administration should not be interrupted, if possible. In case of infusion interruption, due to any technical or logistic reason, the interruption should be as short as possible and the infusion continued at the earliest time possible. Every interruption longer than 1 hour should be documented. If the interruption is longer than 4 hours, restart of the infusion should be performed in the hospital, under the supervision of the investigator. The subject should be observed overnight for possible side effects after the restart, either in the hospital or in the outpatient setting as applicable. Administration of dexamethasone premedication as described in Table 8 . It is recommended, if possible, that the infusion duration before and after an interruption should total 28 days per treatment cycle. The daily blinatumomab dose may be up to 10% lower or higher in order to account for possible pump inaccuracies. For dose modifications in case of adverse events see Section 6.5. A dose of up to 10% higher than the intended dose may not require specific intervention. In case of overdose or medication error, the infusion should be immediately stopped. Routine supportive and symptomatic care according to standard medical practice is recommended. Once the subject is stabilized and no clinically relevant safety findings due to blinatumomab are observed, resumption of blinatumomab at a correct dose can be considered after consultation with the Amgen medical monitor. If the overdose results in an adverse event, the subject should be followed carefully until all signs of toxicity are resolved and the adverse event/s should be recorded/reported. Approved"

The hospitalization time depends on investigator´s judgment, as well as safety and tolerability of blinatumomab. However, the hospitalization must span at least the first 2 days after treatment start in the first 2 cycles and after dose step. For cycle 3 and beyond, subjects will at least come in for an 8 hours outpatient observation followed by daily outpatient follow-ups during the subsequent 2 days. Additional hospitalization may be necessary, eg, in case of serious adverse events or restart of treatm ent after treatment interruptions due to adverse events. The infusion bags will be changed by site nursing personnel trained on the protocol and on the proper administration of blinatumomab. Close monitoring during the first 48 hours of treatment in the first 2 cycles will be indicated because of the potential adverse events associated cytokine release triggered by the administration of blinatumomab. Nurses/physicians trained in emergency medicine should be available for immediate intervention in case of complications. 6.2.2.2 Blinatumomab Outpatient Dosing After a subject meets the minimum criteria for inpatient administration and monitoring as described in the above section, and if a subject is deemed stable by the investigator, continuation of blinatumomab infusion may continue as an outpatient. In the outpatient setting, either the subject will return to the study site for changes of the infusion bag or the subject will be visited by a well-trained ambulant/home care service provider at specific intervals to change the infusion bag. The subject and the ambulant/home care service provider will be trained and will receive written instructions for storage of the IV bags. For the ambulant/home care service provider, study-specific requirements and recording of source documentation must be completed before any study-related tasks are started. A comprehensive list of all home care services, including but not limited to the storage, handling, and administration of blinatumomab as well as mandatory procedural and data collection requirements will be separately provided in a home health care manual.

Pre-phase therapy with dexamethasone is recommended before blinatumomab treatment if, in the opinion of the investigator:  LDH indicates rapidly progressing disease, or  signs of extramedullary disease show high tumor load. Pre-phase dexamethasone at a dose up to 10 mg/m2/day during screening. If clinically indicated, the dexamethasone dose can be increased to an absolute maximum dose of 24 mg/day. If the subject received dexamethasone (up to 24 mg/day) for other reasons than pre-phase within 14 days before the start of screening, further pre-phase treatment with dexamethasone is not required. However, premedication with dexamethasone is required within 3 hours before the start of treatment in each treatment cycle and within 3 hours before the dose step as described in Table 7 . It should be noted that in cases of ALL that are refractory to dexamethasone treatment, a preventative effect on CRS can still be achieved. If a subject is refractory to dexamethasone, a pre-phase is not mandatory, but dexamethasone up to a maximum dose of 24 mg/day should be administered at least for the first 2 days of treatment with step-wise reduction afterwards. Subjects who should receive dexamethasone treatments of at least 24 mg/day and who have already received the mandatory 20 mg IV premedication dose before blinatumomab infusion at day 1, may receive the remaining balance of dexamethasone up to a maximum of 24 mg/day . 6.3.2 Pre-dose Dexamethasone Before Each Blinatumomab Treatment Withi n 3 hours before the start of treatment in each treatment cycle and within 3 hours before dose step, mandatory premedication with dexamethasone at 20 mg IV is required for the prevention of CRS resulting from blinatumomab. 6.4 CSF Prophylaxis Before Blinatumomab Treatment Within 14 days before the start of blinatumomab and following each induction and consolidation treatment cycle (after BM aspiration on day 29) a mandatory CSF Approved"

For symptomatic relief of fevers due to any cause (ie, infection, drug fever) the recommended first choice agents for fever management are paracetamol/acetaminophen and/or dexamethasone. The dexamethasone dose should be reduced step-wise as soon as the fever is resolved. If these are not sufficiently effective, pethidin/meperidine is recommended. For pethidin/meperidine, adequate anti-emetic prophylaxis should be administered. The treating physician should also use their clinical judgment to determine the underlying cause of the fever and treatment . 6.8.3 Additional Treatment for Special Subject Populations Subjects who enter the study who previously underwent alloHSCT and present with a medical history of GvHD must receive antifungal prophylaxis. For subjects with a high risk for CMV infection [prior CMV re-activation or risk constellation in prior alloHSCT (donor: CMV negative, recipient: CMV positive)], one of the following measures should be performed:  Intensive (2x/week) CMV-PCR follow-up with early therapeutic intervention if positive or  Prophylactic CMV treatment. 6.9 Concomitant Therapy Throughout the study, investigators may prescribe any concomitant medications or treatments deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care except for those listed in Section 6.10. 6.10 Excluded Treatments During Study Period The following medications are not permitted during a subject’s participation (including the induction, consolidation treatment) of this study:  Any anti-tumor therapy other than the protocol specified therapy (ie, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, cytotoxic and/or cytostatic drugs);  Chronic systemic (> 7 days) high-dose corticosteroid therapy (dexamethasone> 24 mg/day or equivalent); any other immunosuppressive therapies (except for transient use of corticosteroids);  Any other investigational agent 6.11 Medical Devices Blinatumomab must be administered using infusion pumps approved for use by the appropriate regulatory authorities for the country in which the subject is undergoing treatment, in both the inpatient and outpatient setting.

Postmenopausal is defined as:  A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. (A high follicle stimulating hormone level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy [HRT]. However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single follicle stimulating hormone measurement is insufficient).  Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use 1 of the non -hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. Approved"

The reliability of sexual abstinence must be evaluated in relation to the duration of the trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.)  Double barrier method: the male uses a condom and the female may choose either a cervical cap, diaphragm, or contraceptive sponge with spermicide (A female condom is not an option due to the risk of tearing when both partners use a condom.) Female subjects of childbearing potential must receive pregnancy prevention counseling and be advised of the risk to fetus if they become pregnant during treatment and for an additional 48 hours after the last dose of C IVI blinatumomab. Additional medications given during treatment with blinatumomab may alter the contraceptive requirements. These additional medications may require female subjects use highly effective methods of contraception and for an increased length of time. In addition, male subjects may also be required to use contraception. The investigator is to discuss these contraceptive changes with the subject. If a female subject is suspected of being pregnant, the protocol-required therapies must be stopped immediately and may not be resumed until absence of pregnancy has been medically confirmed. 6.13.2 Unacceptable Methods of Birth Control for Women Subjects Birth control methods that are considered unacceptable in clinical trials include: periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational amenorrhea method.

In case of insufficient quality of the aspiration material at the end of each treatment cycle, a core biopsy should be performed before treatment start in the next cycle or at the SFU visit, if the subject has not progressed and no further tr eatment cycles are to be administered.  A fresh BM sample will be collected and analyzed at a central lab for MRD assessment by multi-color flow cytometry at screening and at the end of the first and second treatment cycles. If a marrow aspiration is not possible, or the aspirate does not contain any BM, a core biopsy will be done. In case of core biopsies, no central MRD assessment will be possible due to the need to preserve the biopsy with formalin before shipment. If a subject has not relapsed by their last induction and consolidation treatment cycle, a BM biopsy or aspirate should be performed every 3 months (± 1 month) until relapse. The degree of BM infiltration defined by the percentage of leukemic blasts in BM will be evaluated by local laboratories as per cytological assessment. In addition, the BM slides will be provided to the designated central laboratories for hematological assessment. If immunocytochemistry (ICC) is not possible, then immunohistochemistry (IHC) will be done instead on the back -up core biopsy to confirm cytomorphology. The following markers will be analyzed as needed: CD3, CD5, CD10, CD13, CD19, CD22, CD23, CD33, CD34, CD79A, POX, TDT. Approved"

The relapse will be analyzed by immuno-phenotyping whether it still fulfills the criteria for B-precursor ALL. The onset of relapse is defined by the date of the first sample on which relapse was documented. All hematological assessments of BM will be reviewed in a central reference laboratory. In the event of disease progression or hematological relapse within the treatment pe riod, treatment will be terminated. Extramedullary disease: If clinical signs of extramedullary lesions are present, assessments will be performed according to Cheson criteria (Table 10). If computed tomography (CT) scans are conducted, this should be done according to standard clinical practice. If a CT scan has been performed within one month before start of blinatumomab treatment and if no clinical signs of a change of disease state have been observed, this assessment can be regarded as screening assessment.

Subjects who are blind or illiterate may have the PRO questionnaires read to them by the study staff. The study staff, however, cannot interpret any of the questions for the subject. Patient reported questionnaires will be completed as outlined in Schedule of Assessments (Table 9 ). The EORTC quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) is a generic patient reported outcomes instrument for assessing the health related quality of life (HRQoL) of cancer subjects participating in clinical trials. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, a global health status/QoL scale, and 6 single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items. No item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning; a high score for the global health status/QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problems. 7.2.15 Laboratory Assessments All screening and on-study laboratory samples will be collected and processed at the investigators local laboratory and analyzed locally or centrally.

Upon signing a new ICF, a new 21-day screening window will begin. Subjects will retain the same subject identification number assigned at the original screening. After reconsenting, all screening procedures, including the lumbar puncture and BM biopsy, must be repeated unless the procedure was performed within 14 days prior to treatment start . 7.4 Treatment It is strongly recommended that subjects are hospitalized at least during the first 9 days (1 week plus 2 days following dose step) of the first cycle and the first 2 days of the following cycle. The hospitalization time depends on investigator´s judgment, as well as safety and tolerability of blinatumomab. However, the hospitalization must span at least the first 2 days after treatment start in the first 2 cycles and after dose step. For cycle 3 and beyond, subjects will at least come in for an 8 hours outpatient observation followed by daily outpatient follow-up s during the subsequent 2 days. Additional hospitalization may be necessary, eg, in case of serious adverse events or restart of treatment after treatment interruptions due to adverse event s (see Section 6.5). 7.4.1 Days of Infusion (Day 1 to Day 29, Applies to Each Treatment Cycle) 7.4.1.1 Prior to Infusion (D1) Prior to infusion (D1), subjects have to complete all protocol–required procedures as per Table 9 . In addition, the obligatory premedication ( Section 6.3) will be administered. Screening BM assessment sample has to be taken prior to treatment start or during the screening period. For subjects who interrupted treatment because of a CNS event grade 3, an MRI of the head must be performed (read locally) before a new treatment cycle will be started. The results of the D1 laboratory tests taken prior to infusion start will not have to be available before starting treatment with blinatumomab. Assessments that were done within 24 hours prior to treatment start do not need to be repeated at D1 prior to infusion. 7.4.1.2 During Infusion (D1 to D28) The infusion continues for 28 days, all protocol-required procedures and tests as per Table 9 will be performed on D1 to D15 of each treatment cycle.

SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING 9.1 Definition of Safety Events 9.1.1 Disease Related Events Disease Related Events are events (serious or non-serious) anticipated to occur in the study population due to the underlying disease. Please refer to Appendix D for disease related events by system organ class. Such events do not meet the definition of an Adverse Event unless assessed to be more severe than expected for the subject’s condition . All serious disease-related events will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours. Disease-related events that would qualify as an adverse event or serious adverse event:  An event based on the underlying disease that is worse than expected as assessed by the investigator for the subject’s condition or if the investigator believes there is a causal relationship between the investigational product(s)/study treatment/protocol- required therapies and disease worsening, this must be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event. Disease Related Events and/or Disease Related Outcomes that do not qualify as Serious Adverse Events:  An event which is part of the normal course of disease under study (eg, disease progression in oncology or hospitalization due to disease progression) is to be reported as a Disease Related Event.  Death due to the disease under study is to be recorded on the Event eCRF. Approved"
70,page_70,"Product: Blinatumomab Protocol Number: 20130316 Date: 09 March 2020 Page 71 of 105 CONFIDENTIAL 9.1.2 Adverse Events An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject irrespective of a causal relationship with study treatment. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record. The definitio n of adverse events includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition. Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying disease (eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration more than would be expected , and/or has an association with a significantly worse outcome than expected. A pre-existing condition that has not worsened more than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctuation of disease) during the study or involves an int ervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study, is not considered an adverse event. If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Event eCRF. For situations when an adverse event or serious adverse event is due to ALL, report all known signs and symptoms. Death due to disease progression in the absence of signs and symptoms should be reported as the primary tumor type (eg, relapsed/refractory B-precursor ALL ). Note: The term “disease progression” should not be used to describe the disease related event or adverse event. “Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” will not be reported as an ad verse event or serious adverse event. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessment. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as adverse event or serious adverse event if they fulfill the definition of an adverse event or serious adverse event. The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be removed from treatment due to an adverse event.

An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization”, if the event necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay) , and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are an adverse event. If a complication prolongs a hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the adverse event is to be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an adverse event . The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. The definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the criterion of “other medically important serious event”. Examples of such events could include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in the emergency room or at Approved"

All serious disease-related events will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours. The investigator will submit any updated serious disease- related event data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Disease-related events assessed by the investigator to be more severe than expected and/or related to the investigational medicinal product(s)/study treatment/protocol-required therapies, and determined to be serious, must be recorded on the Event CRF as serious adverse events , and reported per Section 9.2.2.2 . Additionally, the investigator is required to report a fatal Disease Related Event on the Event eCRF . 9.2.2 Adverse Events 9.2.2.1 Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That Do not Meet Serious Criteria The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after protocol-required therapies through the SFU visit are reported using the Event eCRF. Adverse events related to obligatory pre -medication as well as adverse events related to study procedures during the screening period will be reported on the Event eCRF . If any other anti-leukemic therapy is started within 30 days after last administration of blinatumomab, subsequently only adverse events assessed as being related to blinatumomab will be reported. During the long -term follow-up period, only adverse events assessed as related to blinatumomab or study procedures will be recorded . The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms),  Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved),  Severity [and/or toxicity per protocol], Approved"

The adverse event grading scale used will be the CTCAE version 4.03. The grading scale used in this study is described in Appendix A. The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to blinatumomab. This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by investigational product (blinatumomab ) or other protocol-required therapies? The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to any study-mandated activity (eg, administration of investigational product, protocol-required therapies, device(s) and/or procedure (including any screening procedure(s)). This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by a study activity (eg, administration of investigational product, protocol-required therapies, device(s)), and/or procedure”? The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline values. In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be recorded as adverse events. However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events. Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse event. The Investigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or reversibility. 9.2.2.2 Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject that occur during the entire study period including the screening period (from the signing of the informed consent) through the SFU visit are recorded in the subject’s medical record and are submitted to Amgen . All serious adverse events must be submitted to Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via the Event CRF . Approved"

However, these serious adverse events can be reported to Amgen. In some countries, investigators are required to report serious adverse events that they become aware of after end of study. If serious adverse events are reported, the investigator is to report them to Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event. Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol-required reporting period will be captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited reporting. 9.2.2.4 Drug-induced Liver Injury Reporting and Additional Assessments Reporting To facilitate appropriate monitoring for signals of DILI, cases of concurrent AST or ALT and TBL and/or INR elevation according to the criteria specified in Section 6.7 require the following: The event is to be reported to Amgen as a serious adverse event within 24 hours of discovery or notification of the event (ie, before additional etiologic investigations have been concluded) . The appropriate CRF (eg, Adverse Event CRF) that captures information necessary to facilitate the evaluation of treatment-emergent liver abnormalities is to be completed and sent to the Amgen. Other events of hepatotoxicity and potential DILI are to be reported as serious adverse events if they meet the criteria for a serious adverse event defined in Section 9.1.3 .

The Clinical Monitor is responsible for verifying the eCRFs at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical research. The Clin ical Monitor is to have access to subject medical records and other study-related records needed to verify the entries on the eCRF s. The investigator agrees to cooperate with the Clinical Monitor to ensure that any problems detected in the course of these monitoring visits, including delays in completing eCRFs, are resolved. In accordance with ICH GCP and the sponsor’s audit plans, this study may be selected for audit by representatives from Amgen’ s Quality, Compliance & Audit (or designees). Inspection of site facilities (eg, pharmacy, protocol-required therapy storage areas, laboratories) and review of study-related records will occur to evaluate the study conduct and compliance with the protocol, ICH GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. Data capture for this study is planned to be electronic:  All source documentation supporting entries into the eCRFs must be maintained and readily available.  Updates to eCRFs will be automatically documented through the software’s “audit trail”.  To ensure the quality of clinical data across all subjects and sites, a clinical data management review is performed on subject data received at Amgen. During this review, subject data are checked for consistency, omissions, and any apparent discrepancies. In addition, the data are reviewed for adherence to the protocol and GCP. To resolve any questions arising from the clinical data management review process, data queries are created in the EDC system database for site resolution and subsequently closed by the EDC system or by an Amgen reviewer.  The investigator signs only the Investigator Verification Form for this EDC study or the investigator applies an electronic signature in the EDC system if the study is set up to accept an electronic signature . This signature indicates that investigator inspected or reviewed the data on the eCRF , the data queries, and agrees with the content. 12.4 Investigator Responsibilities for Data Collection The investigator is responsible for comply ing with the requirements for all assessments and data collection (including subjects not receiving protocol-required therapies) as stipulated in the protocol for each subject in the study.

112,page_112,"Product: Blinatumomab Protocol Number: 20130316 Date: 07 December 2016 Page 2 of 95 CONFIDENTIAL Rationale: The following changes are being made to the study for the reasons indicated: • The Chinese Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) is open to have interim analysis in our study for early NDA filing which was discussed at CDE formal consultation meeting in March 2016. • The interim analysis is planned at 75% (90 subjects) enrollment, strong efficacy is provided at IA by using OBF alpha-spending function where CR/CRh* rate has to be equal to or greater than 42.2%. • In terms of safety, although study may have the chance for early NDA filing at the time of interim analysis, the study won't stop enrollment and will continue to enroll the remaining 30 patients. The 120 subjects’ safety data will be provided to CFDA. • Change in exploratory objectives and endpoints: the acute lymphoblastic leukemia symptom scale (ALLSS) was removed as this scale was not validated. • Change in the statistical hypothesis: Considering the available efficacy data in available treatment for adult relapsed/refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (R/R ALL), the lower limit of 95% CI of CR/CRh* rate of blinatumomab was increased to 30%. • Number of subjects: The number of subjects was increased from 100 to 120 to ensure 90% power to detect a significant difference between historical control of 30% and blinatumomab of 45% in CR/CRh* rate at 2.5% one-sided significance level. • Interim analysis: For R/R ALL patients, there is no good choice of treatment and new effective drugs are urgently needed. If the efficacy result of interim analysis is compelling and with a clear benefit-risk, early filing with interim analysis data could meet clinical needs. • Inclusion Criteria: According to the global studies data, different prior salvage therapies have different clinical benefits. Based on clinical practice in China, the patient population needs to be refined to avoid bias on study results. • Laboratory analytes and biomarker tests: Clarifications were made to some of the protocol required procedures and provided additional detail as needed; biomarker testing that was not allowed in China was removed. • Combine Safety Data Review Committee (SDRC) with Data Review Team (DRT): The DRT will review the safety data during the interim analysis; therefore, there is no need for an SDRC.
