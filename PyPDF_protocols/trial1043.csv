In the case of PD, subjects will continue treatment and have confirmatory scans 4 weeks after the initial scan documenting PD. In ca se of confirmation of PD per RECIST patient will come off treatment. For subjects who achieve a PR or CR on M7824 gemcitabine combination therapy and then subsequently develop disease progression after stopping therapy, due to reasons other than PD (AE which later resolve), 1 re-initia tion course of treatment at th e same dose and schedule of M7824 only is allowed at the discretion of the Investigator. Gemcitabine will not be administered again. The Investigator will need to confirm that the benefit of re-initiating treatment outweighs risks of WR[LFLWLHV involved, such as that which led to initia l treatment discontinua tion.

Prior to re-i nitiation of the study treatment, malignant disease needs to be radiologically re-staged to assess all known sites of the disease and to establish a new baseline for s ubsequent tumor measurements. Relevant safety laborator y samples must be draw n and results available and verified prior to re-initiating treatment. Pa tients should be reconsented at th is point. Subjects who re-initiate treatment will stay on study and will be treated and monitored according to the Study Calendar 3.7. During re-treatment no rese arch procedures will be done. A time window of up to 3 days before or 1 day af ter a scheduled visit day (-3 / +1 days) will be permitted for all study procedures. In addition, the tumor evaluation has a tumor assessment"

Furthermore, if any Screening/Baseline procedures are conducted within 3 days prior to Day 1 of Cycle 1 the assessments scheduled on Cycle 1, Day 1 do not need to be repeated. 3.5.1 End-of-Treatment Visit All subjects should undergo an End-of-Treatment visit after discontinuation of M7824 for any reason. This visit should be performed on the day or within 7 days after the decision to discontinue trial treatment but before any ne w antineoplastic therapy is starte d (if possible). If it is known to the Investigator at the time of the End of-Treatment visit that the subject will start new treatment within 28 days of last treatment or they will be un able to return within 28 days of last treatment, assessments associated with the 28-Day Safety Follow-up visit may be conducted at the End-of- Treatment visit. The discontinuation visit consists of assessments indicated in Study Calendar, Section 3.7. 3.5.2 Post-Treatment Follow-up 3.5.2.1 28-Day Safety Follow-up Visit A Safety Follow-up visit is sche duled 4 weeks (28 ¬± 5 days) after the last administration of M7824 but before any new therapy is started, if possibl e, whichever occurs earlier. The 28-Day Safety Follow-up visit will comprise a full assessment for safety, immunogenicity, and tumor response as appropriate, which will include assessmen ts indicated in Study Calendar, Section 3.7. 3.5.2.2 Long-term Follow-up All SAEs ongoing at the 28-Day Safety Follow-up visit must be monitored and followed up by the Investigator until stabilization or until the outcom e is known, unless the subject is documented as ‚Äúlost to follow-up.‚Äù In addition, all trial drug-relate d SAEs occurring after 28-Day Safety Follow-up visit and ongoing at the Safety Follow-up visit have to be followed up in the same manner. Subjects without PD at the 28-Day Safety Follow-up visit will be followed till disease progression (CT / MRI scans every 12 weeks with the first assessment 12 weeks after the previous tumor assessment until PD). Subjects with PD after the 28-Day Safety Follow-up visit, will be followed quarterly (¬± 14 days) for survival (including assessmen t of any further anticancer therapy) by phone call or e-mail for 1 year. Survival follow up will continue every 6 months after that. 3.6 Questionnaires The rationale for questionnaires is discussed in Section 1.2.16 and timing is specified in Study Calendar 3.7. The average time to complete these instruments is 20 minutes. For English speaking subjects only."

Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. 6.3.1 Disease Parameters Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diam eter to be recorded) as: ‚Ä¢ %\FKHVW[ -UD\ !PP  ‚Ä¢ By CT scan: o Scan slice thickness 5 mm or under as >10 mm with CT scan o Scan slice thickness >5 mm: double the slice thickness ‚Ä¢ :LWKFDOLSHUVRQFOLQLFDOH[DP !PP All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal fractions of centimeters).

All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesi ons should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of e ach should be noted throughout follow-up. 6.3.2 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All baseline evaluations should be perfo rmed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. The same method of assessment and the same t echnique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up.

However, CT is preferable. Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has de fined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable le sion should be twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situ ations (e.g. for body scans). 8VHRI05,UHPDLQVDFRPSOH[LVVXH 05,KDVH[FHOOHQWFRQWUDVWVSD WLDODQGWHPSRUDOUHVROXWLRQ  however, there are many image acquisition variable s involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement. Furt hermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed , the technical specifications of the scanning sequences used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow-up shoul d be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measured/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. 6.3.3 Response Criteria All the scans performed at Baseline and other imaging performed as clinically required (other supportive imaging) need to be repeated at subse quent visits. In general, lesions detected at Baseline need to be followed using the same imaging methodology and preferably the same imaging equipment at subsequent tumor evaluation visits. Brain CT / MRI scan should be performed, if clinically indicated by development of new specific symptoms or on the discretion of the Principal Investigator.

The most appropriate measures to ev aluate the tumor status of a subject should be used.

The irRC were created using bi-dimens ional measurements (as pr eviously widely used in the World Health Organization criteria). For this trial, the concepts of the irRC are combined with RECIST 1.1 to come up with the modified irRC. For modified irRC, only target and measurable lesi ons are taken into account. In contrast to the RECIST 1.1 criteria, the modified irRC criteria (a ) require confirmation of both progression and response by imaging at 6 weeks after initial ima ging and (b) do not necessarily score the appearance of new lesions as progressive disease if the sum of lesion diameters of target lesions (minimum of 10 PPSHUOHVLRQPD[LPXPRIWDUJH WOHVLRQVPD[LPXPRISHURU JDQ DQG PHDVXUDEOHQHZOHVLRQVGRH VQRWLQFUHDVHE\¬ï The same method of assessment and the same t echnique should be used to characterize each identified and reported target lesion(s) at baseline, during the trial, and at the end of trial visit.
