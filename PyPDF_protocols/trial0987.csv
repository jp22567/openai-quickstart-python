3,page_3,"INITIATE Trial Page 4 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 SYNOP SIS PROTOCOL TITLE: Individualized ITI Based on FVIII Protection by VWF ( INITIATE ) OVERVIEW: The primary goal of the INITIATE trial is to compare the clinical outcome of individualized lot selection to random lot selection utilizing one plasma -derived von Wil lebrand factor (VWF)/coagulation factor (FVIII) complex concentrate for immune tolerance induction (ITI) in subject s with congenital Hemophilia A , FVIII activity ≤2%, and a historical high -titer inhibitor [≥5 Bethesda Unit (BU)]. TREATMENT ARMS: Participants will be randomized on a two-to-one basis between one of two study arms, individualized lot selection (alternative treatment arm) and random lot selection (standard treatment arm, current US clinical practice in ITI). Study sites, participan ts and investigators will be blind ed to the assigned treatment arm. Alternative Treatment Arm : Two-thirds of the participants will be randomized to blinded individualized lot selection for ITI. The target initial dose of FVIII for ITI is 200 IU/ kg/day intravenously . Wilate® will be the VWF/FVIII complex concentrate ( Octapharma USA, Inc. ; U.S. License No. 1646) prescribed during the trial . A FVIII dose reduction will be used for subjects receiving Hemlibra® (See Appendix IV for specifics) . Individualized lot selection will be performed according to a modified Oxford method in a central laboratory, by testing subject ’s plasma against 4 -6 lots of Wilate® and selecting the one with the highest residual FVIII activity remaining after incuba tion (lowest Oxford titer) . The same lot will be used throughout the entire ITI course for each subject . If the selected lot is depleted prior to the completion of ITI, a second individualized lot selection will be performed using the original plasma sampl e provided at baseline . At six months, participants in the standard treatment arm who still have an inhibitor titer >0.6 may be switched to the alternative treatment arm. They will be treated as new participants who have failed prior ITI and a second individualized lot selection will be performed using the original plasma sample provided at baseline. Standard Treatment Arm : One-third of the participants will receive random lot selection for ITI. The dose and concentrate (Wilate®) used will be the same as that for the alternative treatment arm . Concentrate will be randomly selected from available lots. The same lot will be used throughout the entire ITI course for each subject . If the random lot is depleted prior to the completion of ITI, a second lot will be randomly selected. In both cases the random lot will be tested against the subject ’s plasma to measure the residual FVIII activity after incubation. The results of this te st will not be used for lot selection. OBJECTIVES: Primary Objective: The primary objective of the INITIATE trial is the time to achieve negative inhibitor (<0.6 BU ) compar ing individualized lot selection to random lot selection . Secondary Objectives: Secondary objectives of this study include the time to achieve partial and complete success , maintenance of inhibitor eradication, monthly break -through bleeding"
4,page_4,"INITIATE Trial Page 5 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 rates, cost of ITI including cost of bypassing agents for bleeding control, and adherence to the ITI treatment regimen comparin g the standard to the alternative therapy. The impact of inhibitor titer at start of ITI and during the course of ITI, including the peak titer of the inhibitor, will be investigated . Additionally, biologic assays will be performed to understand factors related to ITI success. HYPOTHESIS: The primary hypothesis is that the time to negative inhibitor (<0.6 BU) will be shorter with individualized lot selection compared to random lot selection . INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusion Criteria: Subjects must meet all of the following criteria to be eligible for enrollment into the study: 1) Diagnosis of congenital Hemophilia A and baseline FVIII ≤2%. 2) Weight ≥ 5 kg 3) History of FVIII inhibitor titer ≥5 BU 4) Current FVIII inhibitor titer ≥5 BU or ≥0.6 BU and failed ITI defined by FVIII recovery <66% normal and half -life <6 hours 5) Adequate venous access for daily concentrate infusions 6) For participants <18 years, a parent or guardian willing and able to provide informed consent with v erbal or written assent from the child if require by the local institution . For participants ≥18 years, a willing ness and ability to provide informed consent from the subject . 7) Ability to comply with study related treatments, evaluations, and follow -up. Exclusion Criteria: Subjects meet ing any of the following criteria are ineligible for enrollment in the study: 1) Acqu ired hemophilia 2) Congenital or acquired bleeding disorder in addition to Hemophilia A 3) ITI factor replacement regimen within the past one month unless there is clear evidence of ITI failure with no reduction in inhibitor titer over the past two months 4) HIV positive with viral load ≥200 particles/ µL or ≥400,000 copies/mL 5) Rituximab within the past 3 months 6) IVIG within the past 1 month 7) Treatment with other immunosuppressive drugs within the past 1 month (excluding intermittent steroid use for asthma) 8) Concomitant experimental treatment 9) History of hypersensitivity to plasma -derived VWF - or FVIII -containing concentrates 10) Elective surgery plan ned in the next 6 months (excluding vascular access procedure) 11) Any condition or chronic illness, which in the opinion of the investigator makes participation ill -advised 12) Inability or unwillingness to complete requ ired screening , follow -up, and exit studies"
5,page_5,"INITIATE Trial Page 6 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 CRITERIA FOR EVALU ATION: Efficacy: Primary Endpoint: The primary endpoint is time to inhibitor <0.6 BU . This endpoint was chosen because a shorter time to negative inhibitor should decrease monthly break -through bleeding frequency in the early phase of ITI, reduce morbidity and cost, and improve quality of life. Secondary Endpoints: Secondary endpoints include time to achieve partial and complete success as defined according to the following criteria: • Inhibitor titer <0.6 BU . • Incremental in vivo FVIII recovery in the normal range [≥66% of normal (1.5% per IU/kg), equal to 0.99% per IU/kg] with samples taken prior to and 15 or 30 minutes after concentrate treatment. The recovery assessment should be done without any wash -out period. • Half-life of FV III >6 hours . The half -life assessment should be done in a non -bleeding status without any wash -out period . Complete Success (CS) of ITI : All three criteria above met. Partial Success (PS) of ITI : The first t wo of the three criteria above met. Partial Res ponse (PR) of ITI : One of the three criteria above met. Partial Failure (PF) of ITI : Inhibitor still present, but titer is decreased to <5 BU in contrast to ≥5 BU before start . Complete Failure (CF) of ITI: None of the above mentioned criteria met, and the inhibitor titer is still ≥5 BU."
6,page_6,"INITIATE Trial Page 7 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 The following additional secondary endpoints will be evaluated: • Absence of relapse, up to 12 months after achievement of complete or partial ITI success • The number of break -through bleeding events during the course of ITI -treatment • Cost of ITI – including bleeding control using bypassing agents prior to start and during ITI • Health -Related Quality of life (HRQoL) • Adherence with the ITI treatment regimen • The impact of inhibito r titer at start of ITI and during the course of ITI, including the peak titer of the inhibitor • Additional biologic assays will be performed to understand factors related to ITI success. STUDY DESIGN: The INITIATE trial is a post-marketing investigator -initiated double -blinded randomized clinical study , comparing alternative therapy to standard therapy to reduce the time to inhibitor titer <0.6 BU . Participants from any Hemophilia Treatment Center in the US will be eligible. Each clinical si te will be led by a hematologist experienced in the management of congenital hemophilia. STUDY POPULATION: Participants of any age with congenital hemophilia, FVIII activity ≤2% and historical high -inhibitor (≥5 BU) . SAMPLE SIZE: 120 participants will be enrolled . RANDOMIZATION: Participants are randomized to treatment arm in a 2:1 ratio . A central laboratory will test each alternative treatment arm subject’s plasma sample against 4 -6 factor lots and the lot with the lowest Oxford titer will be assigned . Subjects in the standard treatment arm will have lot assignment performed by random lot selection. The treating physician, treatment site staff , and participant will be blinded to the randomizatio n allocation. DATA MANAGEMENT: Clinical sites enter data via a secure, internet -based electronic data capture (EDC) system. HUMAN SUBJECTS: The most important risk for the participants is bleeding; high rates of bleeding are expected in individuals with Hemophilia A and inhibitors."

13,page_13,"INITIATE Trial Page 14 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 BACKGROUND AND SIGN IFICAN CE Inhibitor formation in patients with hemophilia Anti-FVIII inhibitor (antibody) formation is the most serious complication of Hemophilia A treatment today, being estimated to occur in up to 10 -30%, or more, of those with severe Hemophilia A . Use of FVIII is generally futile in this group, because the inhibitor will rapidly inactivate the infused concentrate. More than 90% of inhibitors occur wit hin the first 50 exposure days and 50% before the first 15 exposure days. Several risk factors for the development of inhibitors to FVIII have bee n identified in patients with Hemophilia A . The incidence of inhibitors depends on both, genetic factors: • severity of hemophilia • type of mutation1 • ethnicity2 • family history of inhibitors3 • the HLA genotype4,5 and non -genetic factors: • age at first FVIII treatment6,7 • intensity of FVIII treatment8 • continuous infusion of FVIII9 • type of FVIII concentrate used10 Walsh and colleagues from the Centers for Disease Control and P revention recently demonstrated a higher rate of mortality in FVIII inhibitor patients.11 In multivariate analysis the odds of death were 70% higher among patients with a current inhibitor co mpared to those without an inhibitor (p<0.01), and the deaths among inhibitor patients were primarily attributed to bleeding complications. Management of high -titer inhibitors Management of Bleeding Treatment options for bleeding in patients with high-titer inhibitors include bypass ing agents, activated recombinant coagulation factor VII (rFVIIa; NovoSeven®) and/or plasma -derived activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC; FEIBA®), or porcine recombinant coagulation factor VIII (rFVIII ; OBIZUR®). The efficacy of these agents is unpredictable and the results are suboptimal compared to direct FVIII replacement ."
14,page_14,"INITIATE Trial Page 15 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 Prevention of Bleeding Ideally, patients with hemophilia should receive continuous, long -term prophylaxis to prevent spontaneous bleed ing and h emophilic arthropathy. Inhibitors complicate the current standard of care, being three times weekly (or individualized) FVIII prophylaxis (preventive FVIII replacement therapy) to prevent joint bleed ing and arthropathy long -term. Bypass ing agents can be used for prophylaxis, but must be given more frequently, are associated with high costs and are less efficacious compared to FVIII prophylaxis in patients without inhibitors . Immune Tolerance Induction ITI therapy is a program of regular in fusions over a prolonged period of time to eradicate inhibitors. ITI is the treatment of choice to eliminate inhibitor s and restore normal FVIII pharmacokinetics (recovery and half -life of FVIII). This enables regular FVIII treatment in the case of bleeding and surgery, as well as prophylactic treatment to prevent hemophilic arthrop athy and life -threatening bleed ing. Successful ITI leads to improved quality of life and reduced costs .12 Current recommendations for ITI are based on data from ITI registries, systematic reviews 12-15 and the International Immune Tolerance Study (NCT00212472).16 Several publications include guidance in terms of choice of product (VWF -containing plasma -deriv ed (pd) FVIII).17-21 Expert groups in North America and Europe have published treatment experience and recommendations .22,23,24 The Association of Hemoph ilia Clinic Directors of Canada25 and UK Haemophilia Centre Doctors Organi zation )26 have published national clinical practice g uidelines . The National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF) Medical & Scientific Advisory Council (MASAC) has not published clinical practice guidelines for the US . ITI Treatment Strategy The dose of FVIII used varies from 50 IU/kg on alternate days to 100 IU/k g twice daily . The International Immune Tolerance Study (NCT00212472) demonstrated a lower bleeding rate and shorter time to ITI success in participants treated with 200 IU/kg/day compared to 50 IU/kg three times per week.16 Today rFVIII concentrates are the products of choice for standar d Hemophilia A treatment in the US, also for 1st-line ITI treatment of inhibitors. Currently, no pdVWF/FVIII products are licensed specifically for ITI treatment by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA). Clinicians may choose to start with a pdVWF/FVIII product or switch to this product on an individual patient basis.22 The REScue Immuntolerance Study (RESIST) (NCT01051544 and NCT01051076) aimed to compare ITI outcomes between rFVIII and pdVWF/FVIII ITI regimens.27 These studies were recently closed due to poor accrua l. Data have not been published. The European PEDNET Hemophilia includes evaluation of etiology of inhibitors and ITI outcomes .28 The PRospectIve Observational Study of PlasMa -derived FVIII/VWF in Immune Tolerance Induction ( PRISM ) Registry is an observational study in the US evaluating inhibitor outcomes in patients treated with the pdVWF/FVIII concentrate, Alphanate®.29 Duration of ITI ITI success is defined by a negative inhibitor titer (<0.6 BU) , improved FVIII in vivo recovery (≥66 or 80% of calculated FVIII recovery) and increased FVIII half-life (≥6 or 7 hours).16,26,29"
15,page_15,"INITIATE Trial Page 16 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 ITI may be achieved within 6 -12 months, but can take as long as 1 -3 (even more) years to achieve tolerance .30 Reported efficacy is 50 -80% depending on the product used for ITI. Once tolerance is achieved, dose and frequency of factor infusions are gradually tapered to a prophylactic regimen. Inhibitor titers and FVIII levels should be tested monthly during the first half year, subsequently every second month. After tolerance is achieved, it is recommended to follow the patients closely for relapses in order to restart ITI immediately .26 Alternative strategies may be considered if the inhibitor titer fails to drop at least 20% over each 6-months period after the peak titer has been reached.26 Costs of Inhibitors and ITI Treating patients with high -titer inhibitors is costly.31 In addition to cost of FVIII during ITI, there are costs of bypassing agents to prevent and treat bleeding. ITI treatment is expensive in the short run. However, successful eradication of an inhibitor pays off in the long run. Once a negative inhibitor titer (<0.6 BU) is achieved the monthly bleeding rate drops by up to 90% (86.1 -86.4% in the Octanate® study ; data not published; Octanate® in ITI -BLA package submitted to FDA), and the use of bypassing agents and associated costs decrease. After successful ITI, prophylaxis is resumed. Overall, the cost of prophylaxis is three times less expensive than prophylaxis wi th bypassing agents32. Compared with patients on on -demand or prophylactic treatment using bypass ing agents, subjects who have gone through a successful ITI have lower drug and hospitalization costs ($ 22.2 million vs. $ 38.7 million or $ 42.2 million), longer life expectancy (74.3 years vs. 69.6 years for both regimens), and fewer/almost equal bleeding events (801 vs. 1819 or 694), respectively.33 The average direct medical costs for treatment of children and adults wi th inhibitors can be quantified in a cost of care analysis. Such an estimate has been done for Octanate® in ITI versus the on -demand use of NovoSeven®.34 The costs for on -demand pre -ITI phase management with NovoSeven® for one year was compared with the time period after start of high-dose ITI with Octanate®, and the break -even point analysis to estimate the number of years after whic h treatment with Octanate® pays off was done. The median age of initiation of high-dose ITI with Octanate® was 8 years for children and 23 years for adults. During the period with on -demand treatment of bleeding episodes with NovoSeven® before ITI with Oct anate®, the children (n=8) had a mean body weight of 36 kg, bled 17 times per year, were treated for 6 days per bleed – twice per day – using 120 μg/kg, and were hospitalized 19 times per year. The ITI treatment was done with a mean of 230 IU/kg daily, ble d 5 times per year, and were hospitalized zero times per year. The time until complete success was 11 months (range: 6 -17) and the prophylactic dose after tolerance was 47 IU/kg three times per week. The treatment with high-dose ITI, including prophylaxis after tolerance, with Octanate® over 10 years had average costs of € 2.5 million, which is € 7.5 million less than the €10 million costs calculated for the on - demand NovoSeven® option over 10 years. The mean break -even point was 1.2 years, after which ITI followed by prophylaxis with Octanate® was cheaper. For adults (n=8) the average cost saving was € 2.5 million and the break -even point was 3 years. Another break -even point calculation between ITI costs and the use of NovoSeven® on-demand in 10 high -respo nder children with inhibitors (mean age: 6 years) confirmed the above findings.35 The use of a bypass ing agent might increase the costs of inhibitor treatment up to 12 - times over the pati ent’s lifetime, and the break -even point of ITI versus NovoSeven® on-demand was 1.4 years after treatment start .35 Effect of VWF on ITI"
16,page_16,"INITIATE Trial Page 17 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 The development of inhibitory antibodies to FVIII requires the interaction of antigen presenting cells (APCs), T -cells, and B -cells with the ability to recognize immunog enic peptides of FVIII.36 VWF forms a non -covalently linked complex with FVIII to stabilize and protect it from protease degradation in the circulation.37 In addition, VWF may partially block the binding of immune cells to FVIII – especially the C2, A3, and maybe also A2 domains – and, thus , reduce the potential for inhibitor formation.37 In vitro studies VWF reduces the imm unogenicity of FVIII in Hemophilia A mice.38 Delignat et al hypothesize that VWF exerts at least two non -mutually exclusive immunoprotective roles towards FVIII – 1) VWF prevents (in a dose -dependent manner) the endocytosis of FVIII by professional APCs by blocking the interaction of FVIII with as yet unidentified endocytic recept or(s), a phenomenon also shown for human APCs;39 and 2) hypothetically, VWF, by virtue of increasing the half -life of FVIII in the circulation, may allow for an increased contact time with tole rogenic marginal B -cells in the spleen.38 VWF -containing pdFVIII products protect FVIII better than nude FVIII against neutralizing antibodies in vitro ,40 and that this causes a better recovery and half -life of FVIII in vivo .41 Furthermore, pdVWF/FVIII concentrates added to FVIII -deficient plasma with the presence of an inhibitor generate more thrombin in vitro than nude FVIIIs – both plasma -derived and recombinant.42 Finally, it has been demonstrated – both in vitro and by a tail clip survival test – that VWF has a dose -dependent protective effect on FVIII, limiting the inhibitor inactivation of FVIII, and that a preformed complex of VWF with FVIII provides more effective protection from inhibitors than a competitive binding of antibodies and VWF to FVIII.43 Most recently, Bravo et al. studied the differential sensitivity to inhibitors of the native pdFVIII/VWF complex vs. the combination of purified, isolated FVII I and VWF proteins. They conduc ted in vitro inhibitor assays (BU) using various combinations of VWF and FVIII concentrates. Inhibitor titers were higher (i.e. residual FVIII lower) for all nude FVIII concentrates compared to plasma and pdFVIII/VWF concentrates despite pre-incubation with VWF. Thromb in generation was lower with nude FVIII concentrates compared to plasma and PDFVIII/VWF concentrates.44 Based on these findings, the authors recommend that Bethesda assay titration using different FVIII concentrates be used to sele ct the optimal concentrate for ITI .44 This recommendation supports the INITIATE study design. Clinical Data of VWF/FVIII Concentrates for ITI Octapharma conducted a comparison of 26 studies comprising 511 patients undergoing ITI, of which 315 subjects participating in 13 studies received pdVWF/FVIII21,45-54 and 196 patients in another 13 studies received nude (recombinant) FVIII.55-67 The patient cohorts in all these publications were incompletely described, but there is a trend towards improved ITI results in patients who previously failed ITI in the pdVWF/FVIII trials than the rFVIII studies. It is clear from this comparison that both pdVWF/FVIII and rFVIII products are different in terms of the ITI success rates. The overall success rate (i.e. both complete and partial success) ranged from 57.5% to 94.1% for the pdVWF/FVIII con centrates, with a complete success rate ranging from 32.0% to 87.9%. When the still ongoing studies53,54 were excluded, the weighted average complete, partial, and overall success rates were 61.0%, 17.4%, and 78.4%, respectively. The two products Alphanate® and Fanhdi® (being essential ly the same product, using the same manufacturing method) impacted the success rates significantly with a low complete success"
17,page_17,"INITIATE Trial Page 18 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 rate of 43.8% and a high partial success rate of 30.8% (to a total of 74.7%), a difference which was statistically significant vers us the other pdVWF/FVIII products (p<0.001). When these products were excluded from the analysis, the complete, partial, and overall success rates were improved to 76.7%, 5.0%, and 81.8%, respectively. The Octanate® figures were 70.8%, 8.3%, and 79.1%, res pectively (total n=48), whereas the Wilate® studies are ongoing (see below ‘ITI treatment experience with Octanate® and Wilate®’). Haemoctin® from Biotest (identical to Octanate®) and Factane® from LFB (Octanate® without heat -treatment, but with nanofiltra tion) showed similar complete response rates to Octanate® with 64.3% and 87.5%, respectively. None of the success rates were dependent on the actual amount of VWF in the products. Thus, the differences seen are most likely related to the quality of VWF and how the FVIII is protected by VWF in the various pdVWF/FVIII concentrates. The rFVIII products had an overall success rate ranging from 25.0% to 81.8%, with a complete success rate in the range from 0.0% to 81.8%. The weighted average complete, partial and overall success rates were 57.1%, 9.2%, and 66.3%, respectively, which is not different from the pdVWF/FVIII except for more partial success in the pdVWF/FVIII group. Among the rFVIIIs, Kogenate®/Kogenate FS® had a complete response rate higher than Rec ombinate®/Advate® (68.1% vs. 43.2%; p<0.05). Alphanate® and Fanhdi® had fewer complete responses and more partial responses than the rFVIII concentrates – 43.8% vs. 57.1% and 30.8% vs. 9.2% (both p values <0.05), respectively. When these products were excl uded from the pdVWF/FVIII products, the complete, partial, and overall success rates were improved to 76.7%, 5.0%, and 81.8%, respectively, which revealed a significantly better performance for the pdVWF/FVIII concentrates over the rFVIIIs with 76.7% (+34. 3%) vs. 57.1% for the complete responses and 81.8% (+23.4%) vs. 66.3% for the overall responses (both p values <0.05; the partial response rate was not different). Based on all these studies it is reasonable to assume that the complete success rate in ITI is at least 45 -75% for pdVWF/FVIII (excluding Alphanate® and Fanhdi®) versus 30 -60% for rFVIII preparations, i.e. around 33% higher for pdVWF/FVIII. Individualized Selection of VWF/FVIII Lots for ITI Individualized selection involves measuring residual FVIII activity when patient plasma is mixed with VWF/FVIII concentrate in vitro . The lot of VWF/FVIII resulting in the highest residual FVIII activity is selected for use in ITI. Today , several methods, including the modified Oxford method, are used for measuring residual FVIII activity after incubation of a FVIII source (concentrate or plasma) with the inhibitor patient plasma.68 The inhibitor titer is the reciprocal of the dilution of patient plasma which results in 50% of residual FVIII, and the difference between 1 Bethesda unit (BU) and 1 Oxford unit (OU) is 1 BU ≈ 1.21 OU – which equals 1 OU ≈ 0.83 BU. The relationship between the residual factor VIII values and BU or OU is described by the equations FVIII res=e(-0.69)BU and FVIII res=e(-0.83)OU. The principle of lot selection is to first test the inhibitor -containing plasma against a FVIII standard to establish the patient’s inhibitor titer (normal BU de termination) and then to test several lots of a product against the same inhibitor plasma to find a lot which gives the highest residual FVIII content (lowest OU titer) . Ideally, the lot providing the highest residual FVIII titer after infusion to the patient, i.e. after being subjected to the anti -FVIII, will challenge the immune system more and provide better prevention and control of bleeding . This strategy is being evaluated in the ObsITI study. ObsITI is an obser vational study of ITI in Europe (www.obsiti.com) . The objective is to investigat e the role of in vitro tests including lot"
18,page_18,"INITIATE Trial Page 19 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 selection according to the modified Oxford method (described above) on individual ITI success rates in patients undergoing ITI. Data on the R ole of Lot Selection in ObsITI Octanate® Data An analysis of 42 Octanate® ITI patients from ObsITI with complete details on the lots used was performed. Thirteen (31.0%) subjects used only selected lots, whereas 29 (69.0%) received random lots (i.e. could be either ideal or suboptimal lots used, details not known) . Among the patients with selected lots 11 (84.6%) had a complete response, the remaining 2 (15.4%) had a partial response. There were no failures in this group. In the random lot coho rt, 21 (72.4%) had a complete response and 3 (10.3 %) had a partial response, whereas there were 5 (17.2%) failures in this group. None of these differences was significant statistically. Two of the patients had inhibitor titers above 200 BU, both of them w ere in the random group – 1 complete success and 1 failure. These were defined as outliers. Based on the time to reach a negative inhibitor titer (<0.6 BU; criteria 1), FVIII incremental recovery ≥80% (criteria 2), and FVIII half -life ≥7 hours (criteria 3) , Kaplan -Meier curves for the two cohorts were made, displaying the days versus the probability of reaching each of the three criteria. The time to reach a negative inhibitor titer (<0.6 BU; criteria 1) was shorter for the patients with lot selection, although the difference did not reach completely the significance level (p=0.061). The time to reach a FVIII incremental recover ≥80% (criteria 2) was again shorter for the subjects in the lot selection group and this difference was significant (p=0.013), whereas the time to reach a FVIII half -life ≥7 hours (criteria 3) was the same for the two groups (p=0.78). The median time to reach a negative inhibitor titer (<0.6 BU; criteria 1) with a probability of 50% (0.5) was calculated to be 49 days v ersus 132 days for the batch selection versus the random lot group, respectively. The median time to reach a FVIII incremental recovery ≥80% (criteria 2) with a probability of 50% (0.5) was of course slightly longer, but showed the same roughly three month s difference with 78 days versus 151 days for the lot selection versus the random lot group, respectively. The hazard risk ratios calculated were 5.3 and 2.85 for the time to criteria 1 and 2, respectively. With a hazard ratio of 2 (and outliers excluded) combined with e.g. a power of 85% and an alpha of 2.5% or a power of 90% and an alpha of 5%, roughly 50 patients in each arm (100 in total) would be needed to show a difference between lot selection and random lots in ITI, using time until reaching a ‘nega tive inhibitor titer (<0.6 BU; criteria 1) with e.g. a ≥80% reduction in the monthly bleeding rate’ and/or reaching a ‘FVIII incremental recover ≥80% (criteria 2)’ as the end-point(s). To use ‘complete success’ (i.e. fulfilled criteria 3) as end -point is u nrealistic, as there were no difference between lot selection and random lots in this analysis, although the reason for that can be that some of the random lot patients probably got ‘good lots’ too. Wilate® for Use in ITI Wilate® was launched for the first time in Germany in 2005 , and is approved for the treatment of both von Willebrand disease (VWD) and Hemophilia A in Europe.69 In the US, Wilate® is approved only in VWD (since 2009) .70 Wilate® is a high -purity (i.e. 100 IU FVIII/mg tot al protein) pdVWF/FVIII complex concentrate , purified by the use of ion -exchange chromatography columns, viral safeguarded by a combination of the chemical solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment (gold -standard for enveloped viruses such as HIV, HBV, and HCV) an d terminal dry -heat (TDH) treatment (state -of-the-art method for both enveloped and non -enveloped viruses – the latter like HAV and parvovirus B19).71 Wilate® is further purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and a special ultra -/dia-filtration (UF/DF) technique. Parvovirus B19 responds completely different to heat inactivation than other viruses. The externalization of the viral DNA, leaving an empty – but intact capsid, renders the virus non -infective – but still immunogenic.72 Thus,"
19,page_19,"INITIATE Trial Page 20 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 seroconversion with formation of anti -B19 IgG is possible in recipients of heat treated pdVWF/FVIII concentrates, but disease is not transmissible at the conditions used, including a specified residual moisture.73 The TDH treatment of Wilate® is 2 hours during manufacturing.74 Wilate® possesses all the important features asked for in ITI, namely h igh purity, a very high pathogen safety profile, and an excellent protection of its FVIII by VWF – all achieved through unique, novel, and innovative techniques such as: SEC and special UF/DF with a high cut -off, as well as an optimized lyophilization and full residual moisture testing combined with a prolonged TDH treatment. Octapharma has reserved l ots of Wilate® for this trial. Wilate® Data From the ObsITI database there are two German patients who received Wilate® for ITI , both completed successfully. The two single cases represent one case each of 1st- and 3rd-line ITI. The number of poor prognosis factors was 3 and 4, respectively, including a historical peak titer of ≥200 BU. The 3rd-line ITI patient was switched to Wilate® only after 16.5 years, with the two previous attempts being done with a pdFVIII (almost devoid of VWF) and pdVWF/FVIII product other than Octanate® or Wilate® – with 2.4 -fold more VWF than FVIII. The 1st-line ITI patient achieved a negative inhibitor after 2.8 months, normal FVIII recovery after 9.2 months, and a normal FVIII half -life after 10.2 months . The 3rd-line ITI achieved a negative inhibitor titer after 3.3 years , normal FVIII recovery after 3.6 years and a normal FVIII half-life after 6.2 years. Two abstracts at the 2014 American Society of Hematology Annual meeting described ten Canadian patients who were prescribed Wilate® for ITI in Canada .53,54 Eight patients had 1 one or more poor prognostic factors. One patient (with 3 poor prognos tic factors) has been defined as a failure, whereas the nine other subjects have achieved a reduction in the inhibitor titer and monthly bleeding rate, including one complete success after four months. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE Rationale The rationale for this study is that an optimal regimen for ITI has not been defined, and patients with Hemophilia A and inhibitors have high morbidity, mortality , and associated costs. There are several ongoing registries to evaluate the etiology of inhibitors and to explore ITI outcomes, but there are no open ITI clinical trials at the current time. Primary and Secondary Objectives Primary Objective: The primary objective of the INITIATE trial is to compare individualized lot selecti on to random lot selection in time to negative inhibitor (<0.6 BU). Secondary Objectives: Secondary objectives of this study include the comparison of standard to alternative therapy for time to achieve partial and complete success, maintenance of inhibitor eradication, monthly break -through bleeding rates, cost of ITI – including bleeding control using bypassing agents prior to start and during ITI, quality of life, and adherence with ITI treatment regimen. Addition ally, the impact of inhibitor titer at start of ITI and during the course of ITI,"
20,page_20,"INITIATE Trial Page 21 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 including the peak titer of the inhibitor, will be investigated; and biologic assays will be done to understand factors related to ITI success. Hypothesis The primary hypothesis is that the time to negative inhibitor (<0.6 BU) will be shorter with individualized lot selection compared to random lot selection and that this will impact monthly break -through bleeding and reduce costs. STUDY DESIGN Description of Study Design The primary goal of the INITIATE trial is to compare the clinical outcome of individualized lot selection to random lot selection utilizing one plasm a-derived VWF/FVIII complex concentrate for immune tolerance induction (ITI) in patients w ith congenital Hemophilia A , FVIII activity ≤2%, and a historical high -titer inhibitor (≥5 BU). The INITIATE trial is a post-marketing investigator -initiated double -blinded randomized clinical study comparing alternative therapy to standard therapy to re duce the time to partial or complete ITI success. Participants from any Hemophilia Treatment Center in the US will be eligible. Each clinical site will be led by a hematologist experienced in the management of congenital hemophilia. TREATMENT ARMS: Participants will be randomized on a two-to-one basis between one of two study arms, individualized lot selection (alternative treatment arm) and random lot selection (standard treatment arm, current US clinical practice in ITI). Study sites, participan ts, and investigators will be blind ed to the treatment status assigned. Alternative treatment arm: Two-thirds of the participants will be randomized to blinded individualized lot selection for ITI. The target initial dose of FVIII for ITI is ~200 IU/kg/day intravenously, See Appendix II. The suggested maximum dose is 20,000 IU/day. Investigators may adjust the dose to a minimum dose of 150 units/kg if infusion volume is not feasible in patients without central venous access or in patients with von Willebrand factor levels >250%. Splitting dose into two infusions per day must be approved by the Steering Committee, and if approved, will be considered a protocol deviation. For subjects using Hemlibra®, the dose will be reduced to 50 IU/kg 3 times/week. Wilate® will be the VWF/FVIII complex concentrate (Octapharma USA, Inc., U.S. License No. 1646) prescribed for ITI. Individualized lot selection will be performed according to a modified Oxford method in a central laboratory, by testing subject ’s plasm a against 4 -6 lots of Wilate® and selecting the one with the highest residual FVIII (lowest Oxford titer) activity remaining after incubation. The same lot will be used throughout the entire ITI course for each subject . If the selected lot is depleted prio r to the completion of ITI, a second individualized lot selection will be performed using the original plasma sample provided at baseline."
21,page_21,"INITIATE Trial Page 22 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 At six months, partic ipants in the standard treatment arm who still have an inhibitor titer >0.6 may be switched to the alternative treatment arm.They will be treated as new participants who have failed prior ITI and a second individualized lot selection will be performed using the original plasma sample provided at baseline. Each Wilate® batch includes 1.6 -1.8 million IU and is expected to last for about 3 -57 months depending on the weight of the subject and prescribed dose. See dosing chart. (Appendix II) Standard treatment arm: One-third of the participants will receive random lot selection for ITI. The dose and concentrate used will be the same. Concentrate will be randomly selected from available Wilate® lots. The same lot will be used throughout the entire ITI course for each subject . If the random lot is depleted prior to the completion of ITI, a second lot will be randomly selected. In both cases the random lot will be tested against subject ’s plasma to measu re the residual FVIII activity left after incubation but this result will not affect lot selection . Participants in the standard treatment arm will be offered the option of switching to the alternative treatment after 6 months if they have an inhibitor ti ter >0.6 BU. Description of Primary and Secondary Endpoints Efficacy Primary Endpoint: The primary endpoint is time to inhibitor <0.6 BU . Secondary Endpoints: Secondary endpoints include the time to achieve partial and complete success. The success of ITI is defined according to the following criteria : • Inhibitor titer <0.6 BU. • Incremental in vivo FVIII recovery in the normal range [≥66% of normal (1.5 %/IU/kg), equal to 0.99%/IU/kg] with samples taken prior to and 15 or 30 minutes after FVIII treatment. The recovery assessment should be done after the regular ITI treatment, without any wash -out period. • Half-life of FVIII >6 hours (blood samples for FVIII determination should be taken 6 + 2 hours and 24 + 2 hours after FVIII treatment ). The half-life assessment should be done in a non -bleeding status, e.g. after concentrate treatment, without any wash -out period interrupting the ITI. Complete Success of ITI: All three criteria above met."
22,page_22,"INITIATE Trial Page 23 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 Partial Success of ITI: The first two of the three cri teria above met. Partial Response of ITI: One of the three criteria above met. Partial Failure of ITI: Inhibitor still present, but titer has decreased to <5 BU in contrast to ≥5 BU before start. Complete Failure of ITI: None of the above mentioned criteria met, and the inhibitor titer is still ≥5 BU. The following additional secondary endpoints will be evaluated: • Absence of relapse, up to 12 months after achievement of complete or partial ITI success • The number of break -through bleeding events during the course of ITI -treatment • Cost of ITI – including bleeding control using bypassing agents prior to start and during ITI • Quality of life • Adherence with the ITI treatment regimen • The impact of inhibitor titer at start of ITI and during the course of ITI, including the peak titer of the inhibitor • Additional biologic assays will be performed to understand factors related to ITI success.

Concentrate from the individual ly selected lot will be provided . Packaging and Labeling of Factor Concentrate Wilate® is available as 500 and 1000 IU VWF /FVIII (ratio 1:1) vials. The vials are distributed with a Mix2Vial™ needle -free transfer device. Drug Ordering, Storage , and Accountability Drug Distribution Once subject s have enrolled, been randomized to receive a matched or random lot of product, the information as to which product lot has been assigned to that subject , using the subject ’s identifying code, will be transmitt ed to ASD Healthcare. The subject ’s treating institution will order product from ASD Healthcare through its usual distribution pharmacy using the subject ’s identifying code in the same manner as any other patient product would be ordered. ASD Healthcare ha s committed to provide factor at or below what the institution would be charged if product were ordered for a non -study patient. ASD Healthcare will ship product to the pharmacy routinely used by the institution for that subject and product will be deliver ed to the subject in the usual manner for that pharmacy. Wilate® will be stored at the participant’s home either in the myCubixx refrigerator or their own refrigerator . The myCubixx refrigerator is also provided by ASD Healthcare. Prior and Concomitant Therapy Prior Therapy Prior ITI regimens are allowed. Prior ITI regimen must have been discontinued within 1 month of study enrollment unless there is clear evidence of ITI failure with no reduction in inhibitor titer over the past 2 months. Bypassing Agents As long as the subject ’s inhibitor level is ≥0.6 BU, we expect that prevention and treatment of bleeding episodes may require bypassing agent s. Prophylactic Therapy with Bypassing Agents (anti-inhibitor coagulant complex [FEIBA®],rVIIa, [NovoSeven®RT], and Hemlibra® ) Bypassing agents mnay be prescribed as prophylaxis according to the participant ’s bleeding tendency based on prior reports . The use of bypassing agents should be stopped once the subject s’ inhibitor level is <0.6 BU, but continued use is at the discretion of the treating physician . Bleed Treatment with Bypassing Agents (anti-inhibitor coagulant complex [ FEIBA®] and rVIIa, [NovoSeven®RT])"
25,page_25,"INITIATE Trial Page 26 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 As guidance, the following treatment regimens might be used for treatment of hemorrhages or in subject s with a high bleeding tendency for prevention of bleeding 1,75 FEIBA®: 75-100 IU/kg, twice daily, do sage depending on severity of h emorrhage. Same dosage recommendation is given for prophylactic treatment in subject s with a high bleeding tendency. 1) NovoSeven®RT)=: 90 µg/kg every 2 hours, dosage and frequency may be adjusted based on physician discretion depending on severity of hemorrhage. 2) In case of insufficient effect with FEIBA® and/or NovoSeven®RT, recombinant porcine FVIII (rpFVIII, OBIZUR®) might be an alternative bleeding treatment: 50 -100 IU/ kg up to twice daily, dosage depending on severity of hemorrhage (only recommended in subject s with porcine FVIII inhibitor levels <20 BU). OBIZUR® is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of congenital Hemophilia A . Prophylactic Therapy with Non-factor replacement ( emicizumab -kxwh, Hemlibra®) Hemlibra® is now FDA approved to prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A and FVIII inhibitors . There are no reports of use in combination with ITI and safety is unproven . If an investigator elects to use He mlibra® along with ITI in patients with significant and frequent breakthrough bleeds then the dose of ITI should be reduced to 50 units/kg three times weekly. Investigators should follow prescribing information for Hemlibra® in regards to t reatment of bleeding episodes with other Bypassing Agents (anti-inhibitor coagulant complex [FEIBA®] and rVIIa, [NovoSeven®RT]). Immunosuppression Immunosuppressant and immune modulating agents are not allowed with the exception of intermittent steroid use for asthma. Participant Adherence with ITI Adherence during ITI is very important, as interruptions of regular injections have the potential to reduce the chance for ITI success . Through a system like myCubixx from ASD Healthcare, with RFID -tagged product in a refriger ator with an RFID reader, information on whether subject s are follow ing the treatment regimen can be accessed via a portal . In addition, the product on stock at eac h participant ’s residence is monitored constantly, which allows for notification of the product stocks in real time. Smart tags in the myCubixx refriger ators use a secure cellular network, so no extra network or installation costs are needed. All information in the myCubixx portal is de -identified and do not contain Protected Health Information. In addition, sites will be performing drug accountability. Participants will be asked to bring their empty vials and boxes to their follow -up visits. Inte rruption of Study Drug ITI should not be interrupted for any reason, specifically not for recovery or pharmacokinetic assessments. If a participant is admitted the hospital, the assigned Wilate® lot should be utilized whenever possible. No more than 7 cons ecutive days of alternative concentrate will be allowed."

The participant may start decreasing the ITI dose to eventually receive a prophylactic treatment regimen of ≤50 IU FVIII/kg every second day after complete inhibitor elimination as determined by his treating physician . In cases where partial success is achieved, ITI may be terminated or continued at discretion of the treating physician. In cases where partial response is achieved, ITI will be continued.

Investigators may discontinue protocol -directed study treatment for any subject, if in their professional opinion, the subject’s health, safety, and/or well -being is threatened by continued protocol -directed study treatment. The followin g circumstances require discontinuation of protocol -directed study treatment: • ITI will be suspended in case of insufficient subject 's adherence (<80% prescribed doses in a 3-month period or a single interruption in treatment of ≥7 days ). The choice of further therapeutic options remains the responsibility of treating physician. • In cases of partial or complete treatment failure after a maximum study treatment period of 18 months, ITI will be terminated.

Investigators desiring rapid laboratory results may perform studies in their local lab but official results to be used in data analysis will be from the central laboratory. Efficacy • FVIII inhibitor assay (performed at central lab) • FVIII activity assay (performed at central lab) • Incremental in vivo FVIII recovery in the normal range [≥66% of normal (1.5 %/IU/kg), equal to 0.99%/IU/kg] with samples taken prior to and 15 or 30 minutes after FVIII treatment. The recovery assessment should be done after the regular ITI treatment, without any wash -out pe riod. • Half-life of FVIII >6 hours (blood samples for FVIII determination should be taken 6 + 2 hours and 24 + 2 hours after FVIII treatment). The half -life assessment should be done in a non -bleeding status, e.g. after concentrate treatment, without any wa sh-out period interrupting the ITI. In vitro reactivity of FVIII inhibitors against lots of concentrate Alternative Treatment Arm For participants in the alternative treatment arm, the in vitro reactivity of FVIII inhibitors will be tested against the lots of the study concentrate. The test will be performed according to a modified Oxford method. The batch yielding the highest remaining FVIII activity and the lowest remaining inhibitor titer will be documented. A plasma sample will be retained in case t hat the first lot is depleted and another batch needs to be identified. At least three weeks prior to when a participant depletes his lot, a subsequent lot will be selected (randomly for the Standard Arm and based on FVIII reactivity to Wilate® lots for th e Alternative Arm). Standard Treatment Arm For participants in the standard treatment arm, the in vitro reactivity of FVIII inhibitors against the randomly selected concentrate batch will be performed according to a modified Oxford method. This information will be used for secondary analyses. A plasma sample will be retained in case that the first lot is depleted and another batch needs to be identified."
31,page_31,"INITIATE Trial Page 32 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 For both arms of the study, the lot/s of study concentrate against which subjec t plasma samples are tested are randomly chosen by the Coordinating Center from a database containing all lots currently available. Once a lot is assigned to the subject, verification of receipt of correct lot by the subject will be performed by the C oordi nating Center through the m yCubixx system. Any errors in lot distribution will be escalated and handled appropriately following standard procedures. Safety VWF activity and antigen will be performed at baseline and at interval study visits to determine if there is VWF accumulation during ITI. The rationale is that, although rare , significant thrombotic events have been reported during ITI with VWF/FVIII concentrate.76 Special S tudies Performed at Central L abs (Optional) Epitope Mapping The antibody epitopes on FVIII will be identified by screening peptide libraries and FVIII fragments with inhibitor patient plasma. This will help to identify relevant epitopes recognized by inhibitors in hemophilia A. This research program will give an op portunity to comprehensively study various aspects of inhibi tors and the induction of immune tolerance in a relevant number of patients. Knowledge about relevant epitopes from patient plasma rather than from model systems (i.e. monoclonal antibodies or mou se models) will help to understand the immune response to FVIII and to develop novel strategies to deplete inhibitors or inhibitor secreting B cells (University Hospital Frankfurt, Laboratory for Molecular Haemostasis and Immunodeficiencies, Frankfurt, Ger many). Results will not be shared with the site investigators. Immunogenotyping /HLA genotyping This study will investigate genetic risk factors (gene defect responsible for hemophilia, HLA class II alleles, and immune response genes) as a potential variable with impact on course and outcome of ITI. Recently a significantly higher inhibitor incidence has been found in patients (brothers) with IL -10.G allele 134, TNFA - 308G>A polymorphism within Hap and polymorphisms in the CTLA -4-gene compared to those brothers without the above mentioned polymorphisms77-79 (University Hospital Bonn, Haemophilia Centre, Bonn, Germany). These tests are d esired but not mandatory. Results will not be shared with the site investigators. Factor VIII genetic testing Genetic testing to identify the causative FVIII mutation will be done in conjunction with the HLA genotyping . This test is desired but not manda tory. Results will be shared with the site investigators. Centralized Laboratory Measurements Specimens sent to the C entral Lab are identified by a specimen ID number, and the Central Lab will remain masked to subject ID and treatment assignment. ITI Success Adjudication Process INITIATE will employ a masked process for determining ITI success. The INITIATE Steering Committee will review all of the primary efficacy data to determine ITI success."
32,page_32,"INITIATE Trial Page 33 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 Economic Impact Analysis It is expected that participants who achieve criterion 1 (loss of a measurable inhibitor titer) will have a dramatic decrease in the rate of bleeding and the need for and use of bypassing agents. This should have an impact on the cost of therapy. The use of all clotting products will be assessed in all study participants . The use of the myCubixx system should improve the collection of the data as to the number of times factor is used, the date of use, and the type of factor and for what purpose. This will allow calculation of the average number of doses of product used for prophylaxis, for bleeding episodes and the number of units. Average costs/bleeding episode can be calculated as well as total costs over time. The costs will be estimated from the average sales price of each factor produ ct as published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on the CMS.gov website. This information can be divided by cost early during ITI, cost after reaching criteria 1 and 2. All costs will be calculated in US dollars and average sales pri ces can be determined by year of use since the CMS data is updated annually. Satisfaction/ Health -Related Quality of Life The loss of an inhibitor with the concomitant reduction in bleeding episodes, decrease in use of bypassing agents and eventual reduced frequency of dosing of factor VIII should be accompanied by an improved health -related quality of life ( HRQoL). HRQoL wil l be assessed with hemophilia -specific HRQoL questionnaires according to different age groups , which have been linguistically validated and culturally adapted for the respective languages83. • The ‘Quality of life assessment instrument for children and adol escents with haemophilia’ ( Haemo -QoL) will be used to assess HRQoL for children and adolescents84 . It consist of 21 -77 items depending on the age group pertaining to 8 -13 domains, respectively and a total score with high values implying high impairments in HRQoL. • The ‘Haemophilia -specific Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults’ (Haem -A-QoL)85 will be used to assess HRQoL in adults. It consists of 46 items pertaining to 10 domains and a tota l score . High values imply high impairments in HRQoL. Assessments will be performed at the start of the study, at the first clinical evaluation after negative titer documented, and at study exit . Raw data will be normalized for each study and summary stat istics generated for study participants at each time point as well as longitudinally per participant. INITIATE SAFETY MONITORING PROGRAM Safety Assessment Hemophilia -Related Events A variety of adverse events (AEs) and some serious adverse events (SAEs) are expected to occur during the INITIATE trial due to the nature of the underlying disease and the clinical status"
33,page_33,"INITIATE Trial Page 34 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 of the enrolled subjects. These AE/SA Es will not necessitate discontinuation of treatment and withdraw al from the study. ITI-Related Compl ications • Infections • Thrombotic Events Safety Monitoring Program Safety monitoring will include data capture for adverse events and adverse reactions, safety reviews, and reporting. Data C apture Clinical data will be captured for subject -reported adverse event or suspected adverse reaction information at the time of a study visit. SAEs must be reported in an expedited fashion. A Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will review the reported adve rse events. After reviewing the safety event, the DSMC may recommend a modification of the protocol, termination of the project for an individual center or participant or propose interim analyses. Any of the following drug safety information shall be coll ected: – Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) temporally associated with the administration of Wilate® (definitions and reporting requirements see below) – Other relevant safety information, including post -study safety reports, instances of drug overdose, drug -drug interactions, abuse, misuse, medication error, or lack of efficacy (see below) Adverse Events Definitions An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non -investigational) product. (Definition per International Council on Harmonisation [ICH]) This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severity or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laborator y test abnormalities."
34,page_34,"INITIATE Trial Page 35 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 Note: The sponsor collects AEs starting with the signing of the ICF . Adverse Event Reporting The condition of the subject will be monitored throughout the study. At each scheduled or unscheduled study visit, AEs will be elicited using a standard non -leading question such as “How have you been since the last visit?” In addition, the subject diaries will be checked by study pe rsonnel for any documented event. Any AE or ADR which occurs during the study will be documented in detail on the appropriate CRF. If the subject reports several signs or symptoms representing a single syndrome or diagnosis, the syndrome or diagnosis should be recorded in the CRF. The investigator responsible will grade the severity of all AEs or ADRs (mild, moderate, or severe), the seriousness (n on-serious or serious), and the causality as defined below. The Sponsor is responsible for assessing the expectedness of each ADR (expected or unexpected ) as defined below. In the event of clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings, the tests will be repeated and the subject followed up until the laboratory values have returned to normal and/or an adequate explanation for the abnormality has become available. Diseases, signs, and symptoms and/or laboratory abnormalities already present before the f irst administration of medicinal product will not be considered AEs unless an exacerbation in intensity or frequency (worsening) occurs. The responsible investigator will provide detailed information about any abnormalities and about the nature of and reas ons for any action taken as well as any observations or comments that may be useful for the interpretation and understanding of an AEs or ADR. Severity of AEs The severity of AEs will be graded as follows: • Mild: an AE, usually transient, which causes discomfort but does not interfere with the subject ’s routine activities • Moderate: an AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with the subject ’s routine activities • Severe: an AE which is incapacitating and prevents the pursuit of the subject ’s routine activities. • The grading of AEs is up to the medical judgment of the investigator and will be decided on a case -by-case basis. Causality of AEs The relationship of AEs to the administered medicinal product will be assessed by the responsible investigator. The causality of AEs will be classified as follows: • Probable: reports including good reasons and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship, in the sense of plausible, conceivable, likely, but not necessarily highly probable. A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from"
35,page_35,"INITIATE Trial Page 36 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 administration of the medicinal product ; or that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected medicine; or that is confirmed by stopping or reducing the dosage of the medicine and that could not reasonably be explained by known characteristics of the subje ct’s clinical state. • Possible: reports containing sufficient information to accept the possibility of a causal relationship, in the sense of not impossible and not unlikely, although the connection is uncertain or doubtful, for example because of missing d ata or insufficient evidence. A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the medicinal product ; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected medicine; but that could readily have been produced by a n umber of other factors. • Unlikely: reports not following a reasonable temporal sequence from medicinal product administration. An event which may have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or by environmental factors or other therapies administered. • Not related (unrelated): events for which sufficient information exists to conclude that the aetiology is unrelated to the medicinal product . • Unclassified: reports which for one reason or another are not yet assessable, e.g. because of outstanding informa tion (can only be a temporary assessment). Classification of ADRs ADRs will be classified as expected or unexpected: • Expected: an AE that is listed in the Wilate® package insert. • Unexpected: an AE that is not listed in the Wilate® package insert, or that differs because of greater severity or greater specificity. Outcome of AEs The outcome of all reported AEs has to be documented as follows: (a) Recovered, resolved (b) Recovering, resolving (c) Not recovered, not resolved (d) Recovered, resolved with sequelae (e) Fatal (f) Unknown A subject ’s death per se is not an event, but an outcome. The event having resulted in the subject ’s death must be fully documented and reported. Deaths occurring within 4 weeks after medicinal product ( Wilate® ) treatment end also have to be reported, regardless of whether or not they are considered treatment -related. Action(s) taken AEs requiring action or thera py must be treated with recogniz ed standards of medical care to safeguard the health and well -being of the subject . Appropriate resuscitation equipment and medicines must be available to ensure the best possible treatment of an emergency situation. The action taken by the investigator mu st be documented:"

Any relevant follow -up information will be reported to the Sponsor. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) Serious Adverse Ev ent A SAE based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for Human Use is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: • Results in death • Is life -threatening (The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It d oes not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.) • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • Is a congenital anoma ly/birth defect • Is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product • Is Medically Important* * Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is also appropriate in other situations, such as, important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should us ually be considered serious. One such ‘important medical event’ is the suspected transmission of an infectious agent. These event s, therefore, have to be reported as SAEs . A suspected virus transmission means that virus antigen has been detected in the subject . The passive transmission of antibodies alone does not constitute a suspected virus transmission. SAE Reporting Timelines Within 24 hours after recognition of the event, a ‘Serious Adverse Event Report’ must be completed and submitted whether or not they are suspected to be related to the study treatment . All SAEs should be reported to the Coordinating Center. Exemption from the SAE reporting requirement Exemptions from the SAE reporting requirement include surgeries that are elective or had been planned before study entry or prolongations of existing hospitalizations for economic or social"

Other Relevant Safety Information Instances of drug overdose, drug -drug interactions, abuse, misuse, medication error, or lack of efficacy (items (b) to (g)) should be reported as AEs or SAEs, as applicable. (a) Post -study safety reports The investigator should also report any ADR (i.e., any AE with a suspected causal relationship to the medicinal product ) occurring after completion of the study. The usual procedure for reporting post -marketing safety information should be followed, but th e suspected causal relationship to the clinical study should be stated on the report. (b) Drug overdose An overdose is the deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than that specified in the protocol and higher than the known th erapeutic dose, and it must be of clinical relevance. The event must be clearly identified as an overdose. (c) Drug -drug interactions A drug interaction is a situation where a substance/medicinal prod uct affects the activity of a medicinal product , i.e. increa ses or decreases the effect(s) of an medicinal product , or produces an effect that none of the products would exhibit on their own. The event must be clearly identified as resulting from a drug -drug interaction. (d) Abuse Abuse is the deliberate use of a medic inal product that may lead to addiction accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects. (e) Misuse Misuse is the deliberate administration or use of the medicinal product outside its described indication or outside the current state of the art medica l practice (off -label -use). The reaction must be clearly identified as misuse. (f) Medication error Medication error involves the inadvertent administration or unintended use of a medicinal product which may be caused by the naming, presentation of pharmaceuti cal form/packaging, instructions for use/labelling. The reaction must be clearly identified as a medication error. (g) Lack of efficacy Lack of efficacy is suspected when the therapeutic result is not as expected, e.g., when patients with haemophilia experienc e continued bleeding despite the correct administration of coagulation factors."
38,page_38,"INITIATE Trial Page 39 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 REGULATORY AND CLINICAL MONITORING The Site Principal Investigators (PIs) will perform source document verification of eligibility for all study enrollments. Verification also includes appropriate documentation of consent. Monitoring the timeliness of AE /SAE reporting will be done as events are reported. The study will also be monitored for compliance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Good Clinical Practice Guidelines (GCP). DATA COLLECTION Data Entry and Case Report Forms Clinical sites will enter data onto electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) via a secur e, internet - based electronic data capture (EDC) system. eCRFs must be completed for each subject screened or enrolled according to the subject’s source data on a per -visit basis. Authorized study personnel will each be granted access to the electronic data capture system via provision of a unique password -protected user ID that will limit access to enter and view data specifically for subjects enrolled at their site. Data should be entered into the EDC system within 3 business days of a subject’s visit. Sites will be supplied with a set of source document worksheets that correspond to the electronic case report form (eCRF). The worksheets will serve as source documents and are required to be used to enter data into the eCRFs. In addition, d ata will be collec ted from the subject’s medical record , subject report s, and subject diaries . Data on adherence to ITI dosing regimen will be collected from myCubixx via the portal. HRQoL questionnaires should be sent to the Study Coordinating Center for data entry in order to protect patients’ privacy. STATISTI CAL ANALYSIS Randomization: Part icipants will be randomized 2:1. Treatment arm assignments (A -random lot, B-matched lot) will be determined by computer. The assignment will be communicated to the laboratory performing the matching denoting the subject ’s code number and group assignment. Data Analysis: Analysis of categorical variables, matched/unmatched lots by time to effect will be performe d using Kaplan -Meier plots and log -rank tests. Analysis of continuous and ranked categorical variables (e.g. degree of match) will use Cox regressions or accelerated time failure models. If multiple lots are required for a subject , multilevel models will b e used. Power and Sample Size: A study with 110 participants will have the power to detect a hazard ratio as low as 2 .5 at 90% with an α of 0.05 . Given the initial hazard ratio estimates of 5 for time to BU < 0.6 and 2 .5 for time to recovery > 80%, this should be sufficient. Assuming a drop - out/loss rate of about 10%, the study would try to enroll 120 subject s. An estimate of the number needed to demonstrate that ITI using Wilate® is superior overall (percentage of subjects achieving successful ITI, power of 80% and α of 0.05) is greater than 700 making this as an endpoint unachievable. Interim Analysis : An interim analysis with the aim of possible early termination will use the alpha spending approach as descri bed by DeMets and Lan.80 The Lan -DeMets boundary using the O’Brien -Fleming spending function, assuming that most subjects will have achieved criteria 1 or"

In the event that t rial accrual is slow, an analysis could be performed after 40 subjects have completed at least 6 months of treatment but this would include only about 36% of the total information and the required α < 0.001.81 Any interim analysis will be evaluated by an independent data monitoring board. HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTECTION All aspects of this clinical trial will be conducted according to the protocol, relevant FDA regulations, ICH -GCP Guidelines, and HIPAA for protection of human subjects . IRB approval must be obtained by each participating site. A copy of the IRB approval letter and the approved consent document must be received and approved prior to enrollment of subjects by the site. Copies of approval lette rs for continuing review must be received by the Coordinating Center prior to expiration of IRB approval so that sites’ ability to enroll and treat participants is not interrupted. A copy of the IRB approval letter for each amendment must be received by the Coordinating Center in order for subjects to be enrolled on the protocol amendment. Continuing IRB review will occur annually or more frequently as determined by the IRB of Record for the site. Risk to the Subjects Subjects will be randomly assigned to the standard care or alternative arm of the trial. The risk to the subjects involve s primarily the risk of bleeding with sustained inhibitor titer if they are randomized to the alternative arm of the trial, but this risk remains with the standard arm as well. Additional risks include: 1) minor risks related to venipuncture; 2) adverse reaction to Wilate®; 3) loss of anonymity . Adequacy of Protection against Risks The INITIATE trial will be designed and implemented with great concern for the welfare of participants. Subjects will be recruited by local clinical staff and should be well known to each center since they will already be receiving hemophilia care. If eligible, the participant or participant’s parent will be informed about the study and asked to participate. After detailed discussion of the protocol, they will be given a copy of the informed consent document for review. Participation is comple tely voluntary and parents may withdraw their child from the study at any time. In addition to parental consent, written or verbal assent will be obtained from subjects whenever required by the IRB of Record for the site . Subjects and families will be informed of any information that becomes available during the trial that might impact their continued participation. Protected Health Information (PHI): Subject s will be given code numbers and these numbers will be used to identify blood samples and matched/r andom lot allocation. This includes the drug distribution from ASD Healthcare to the distributing pharmacies and the information derived from the myCubixx refrigerator."
40,page_40,"INITIATE Trial Page 41 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 Oversight of the Study Steering Committee The INITIATE trial will receive overall guidance and oversight from a formal Steering Committee, consisting of the following members: Dr. Ducore, Dr. Thornburg, study site Principal Investigators (P Is) and a representative from the Central Lab . The entire Steering Com mittee will meet remotely twice during each year to discuss and provide direction for the INITIATE trial. Quarterly , the Steering Committee will have a telephone conference call to discuss problems and issues related to subject recruitment, enrollment, tre atment, and data collection; minutes will be distributed. Study Coordinating Center The Study Coord inating Center will oversee the day -to-day issues and problems that arise during the INITIATE trial and will be critical to the smooth functioning of this clinical trial. The Study Coordinating Center will meet with site staff by teleconference on a weekly basis throughout the trial, with a formal agenda designed to anticipate and address clinica l, logistical, and practical problems that are encountered. Site staff will provide a site -specific report during each teleconference meeting, updating the Coordinating Center project manager on subject accrual, enrollment progress, data entry, and adheren ce strategies. During teleconference meetings, site staff will report any technical problems with ITI as applicable . Minutes from the weekly teleconferences will be distributed to each of the clinical site s. Potential Benefits of the Proposed Research to Subjects and Others Potential benefits to participants in this trial include the potential to achieve ITI success earlier and to have few er bleeding episodes. Importance of the Knowledge to be Gained Inhibitors are associated with increased morbidity, mortality and associated costs. Determining an optimal ITI regimen has the potential to have an important impact. Ethics GCP and IRB Review Compliance with GCP guidelines for the conduct and monitoring of this clinical trial will occur through observation of the ethical and regulatory requirements presented in ICH E6, Good Clinical Practice: Consolidated Guideline. By signing this protocol, the investigator agrees to adhere to these requirements. The study (protocol, informed consent, advertisements, produc t package insert , and subject -facing material ) should be reviewed and approved by the IRB of Record for each site . Changes to the protocol will be also be reviewed and approved by the IRB of Record for each site . Subjects must sign written informed consent prior to being screened, before undergoing any study procedures. The investigators and institutions affiliated with this study will permit trial -related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspection(s) by providing direct access to source documents."
41,page_41,"INITIATE Trial Page 42 of 59 Version 3.0 31-Jul-2018 Informed Consent A model informed consent will be prepared by the INITIATE Study Coordinating Center and subsequently provided to clinical centers for preparation of center -specific consent forms. A copy of each site’s IRB approved consent form will be maintained at the Study Coordinating Center , and a new consent and IRB review will be required for any changes in the pr otocol. Families will be provided with a copy of their signed consent document. The peripheral clinical site should follow the sample informed consent as closely as possible. The informed consent can be modified to include IRB required language; the templa te language should not be deleted. Subjects will be provided with a copy of the informed consent and printed materials that further explain the purpose of the study, the medication(s) used in the study, procedures, and assessments. Subjects will also be pr ovided with the telephone numbers of the Principal Investigator and qualified personnel who can assist with their questions and concerns. Confidentiality To ensure confidentiality, all enrolled subjects will be assigned a unique identification number that will be used in all correspondence between clinical centers and the Study Coordinating Center . The DSMC advises on issues such as study design, power estimates, stopping rules, interim analyses, and adverse event reporting. Members of the DS MC also assess the seriousness of unexpected adverse events. When the results of the trial are published, each subject’s identity will remain confidential. Disclosure of Data The Principal Investigator , his or her staff and associates, and the appropriate reg ulatory agencies may use the information included in this protocol as necessary for the conduct of the trial and the safety of subjects. Data from the trial are confidential and may not be disclosed without the written permission of the Study Coordinating Center . Publication of Research Findings The results from this clinical trial have the potential for immediate public health applicability for the hemophilia community. A publications committee will be established to guide publications and authorship. Data analysis and manuscript preparation will occur during the last 6 -12 months of the funding period. At the end of the trial, the main outcome paper will be submitted to a prestigious journal, such as the New England Journal of Medicine , British Journal of Hematology , or Blood . The trial results will be presented at the World Federation of Hemophilia meeting, the International Society of Haemostasis and Thrombosis (ISTH) meeting, the American Society of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology (ASPHO), and the American Society of Hematology (ASH). To educate allied health care professionals, the study results will be presented at Grand Rounds at the respective participating universities, plus the annual National Hemophilia Foundation Meeting. Other results generated from the trial that are not published in the main outcome manuscript will be submitted for publication in prestigious medical journals and presented at the scientific meetings listed above. ASPHO and ASH, organizations with which the investigators have a long -standing professional relationship, will be asked to assist in the educational effort of health care practitioners who care for subjects with hemophilia."
