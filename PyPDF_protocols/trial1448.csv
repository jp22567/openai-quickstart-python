This study will enroll up to as many subjects as complete the TED -C14-006 study. Investigator(s): Multicenter study Site(s) and Region(s): Approximately 28 investigational sites in North America and Europe w ill participate in this extension study Study period (planned): October 2016 –September 2019Clinical phase: 3 Extension Objectives: Prim ary: To evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects w ith SBS. Secondary: To evaluate long -term efficacy of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects with SBS. Rationale: This is a Phase 3, prospective, open -label, long-term extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of teduglutide in pediatric subjects with short bowel syndrome (SBS) who completed the TED -C14-006 study (the core study). In addition to evaluating the long-term safety and durability of efficacy after 24-weeks of treatment, this extension study will evaluate the need for additional teduglutide treatment in these subjects, and will allow the study of first-time treatment of teduglutide -naïve subjects who participated in the standard of care (SOC) treatment arm in TED -C14-006. Investigational product, dose, and m ode of administration: This study will allow repeat doses of teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) once daily (QD) injection for eligible p ediatric subjects. There is no active comparator or reference product. Methodology: This is a Phase 3, prospective, open -label, long-term extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of teduglutide in pediatric subjects who completed the TED -C14-006 study (core study). Once the inform ed consent (and if applicable, informed assent) have been revie wed and signed , demographics, medical history , and short bowel syndrome history will be obtained .Subjects not receiving teduglutide treatment (ie, in a no-teduglutide treatment [NTT] period), will be seen every 12 weeks for safety, parenteral support (PS) requirements, and quality of life. The first NTT visit will occur approximately 12 weeks after the screening visit. At any point after screening, includin g during a NTT period, subjects who meet ≥1 teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria, may proceed immediately to the pre-treatm ent visit if the investigator, subject, and parent agree to proceed with teduglutide therapy . After the pre -treatment visit, sub jects who meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria, and meet none of the teduglutide treatment exclusion criteria, will start a 28 -week cy cle, consisting of 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment at 0.05 mg/kg SC once daily, followed by a 4 -week follow -up period (during which no teduglutide is administered) ( Figure 3-1). During the 28 -week cycle, clinic visits will occur at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28. Phone visits are required approximately 1 w eek after adjustments in PS during the TED treatment period, betw een weeks 1 -24, and w eekly during the TED follow -up period, betw een weeks 24 and 28. Safety and PS requirements will be evaluated at every visit, and quality of life assessm ents will be made approximately every 12 weeks.

Follow ing com pletion of the 28 -week treatment cycle, the subject w ill proceed to the NTT .The first NTT visit, for a subject that completes a treatment cycle, will occur approximately 12 w eeks after the Week 28 (CxW28) visit. Atallsitevisits andtelephone contacts, safety will bemonitored andnutritional support will bereviewed and adjusted as needed. Tomaintain consistency across centers, allattempts should bemade tofollow thenutritional support adjustment guidelines (developed withSBS expert input and provided intheprotocol) fordecisions regarding PSsupport reduction andadvances inenteral feeds based onweight gain, urine andstool output, and clinical stability. Departure from theguidelines, however, isnotconsidered aprotocol deviation. (Appendix 1). Study Design Flow Chart Figure legend: Safety and efficacy data for subjects not receiving teduglutide treatment are captured every 12 weeks, but subjects may proceed to the pre-treatment visit at any time in order to assess eligibility for teduglutide therapy. Eligible subjects will enter a 28-week teduglutide cycle. During this cycle, subjects will return to the site for safety and efficacy assessments at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, and 24 ( solid black lines ).Phone visits are required approximately 1 week after adjustments in PS during the intervening weeks between weeks 2 and 24 ( dashed grey lines ). Subjects discontinue teduglutide at week 24 and enter a 4 - week follow -up (no -treatment) period, during which ph one visits will be performed weekly (solid grey lines ). If an escape criterion is met during the follow -up period, subjects may proceed directly to another pre -treatment visit. Study Inclusion Criteria: The subject will be considered eligible for the study if they meet allof the study inclusion criteria. Teduglutide treatment eligibility does not impact study eligibility. 1.Subject provides written inform ed consent (subject, parent or legal guardian and, as appropriate, informed assent) to participate in the study before completing any study -related procedures. 2.Subject completed the TED -C14-006 study (including subjects in the standard of care treatment arm). 3.Subject understands and is willing and able to fully adhere to study requirements as defined in this protocol. Study Exclusion Criteria: There are no exclusion criteria for this study. Teduglutide Eligibility Criteria: Subjects are eligible for teduglutide treatment if at least one (≥1) of the teduglu tide treatment inclusion criteria, and none of the teduglutide treatment exclusion criteria, are met. In addition, the investigator and the subject (and/or parent or legal guardian, as appropriate) must agree to proceed with treatment.

22,page_22,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 22 Protocol SHP633 -304 08April 2016 1BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 1.1 Indication and Current Treatment Options Short bowel sy ndrome (SBS) is a rare disorder resulting from congenital abnormalities or severe intestinal diseases that result in major surgical resections of the small intestine. I t is estimated that, at most, there are a few hundred pediatric subjects 1 year and older with ( Khan et al. 2015; Wales et al. 2004 ) .Unlike the adult population, the majority of cases of SBS in pediatric subjects are due to congenital anomalies or catastrophic events that occur during infancy . Although the small intestine is capable of remarkable adaptation, excessive loss of absorptive surface area or specialized functions can lead to dependence on parenteral nutrition or intravenous (IV) fluids (parenteral support [PS]). Treatment of both pediatric and adult patients is focused on achieving adequate intestinal absorpt ion to allow for minimization or discontinuation of PS. About 30% of infants with SBS become independent of PS requirements by 12months of age, and an additional 10% wean off PS by 24 months of age. After this time, linear intestinal growth slows. About 60% of pediatric subjects with SBS are able to become independent of PS within 5 years of the initial diagnosis (Khan et al. 2015 ).Nevertheless, despite optimal medical management, many pediatric subjects remain dependent on PS. Complications of long -term PS include liver disease, catheter -related blood stream infections, central line - associated venous thrombosis and dwindling central venous access. Sepsis is the leading cause of death in these pat ients and quality of life is poor (Squires et al. 2012 ) .Accelerating the adaptive process and achieving enteral autonom y is an urgent goal for all patients with SBS who are dependent on PS (Khan et al. 2015 ;Squires et al. 2012 ). Intestinal adaptation is driven by hormonal cues in response to nutrient malabsorption (Drucker and Yusta 2014). Chief among th ese is hormones glucagon -like peptide 2 (GL P-2), which is secreted from L- type enteroendocrine cells that reside in the intestinal epithelium in the ileum and colon. Resection of these regions impairs the adaptive response b y limiting endogenous production of GLP -2. 1.2 Product Background Teduglutide is a novel, recombinant analog of naturally occurring human GLP -2 that regulates the functional and structural integrity of the cells lining the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Teduglutide is a 33 -amino acid peptide that differs from native GLP- 2 in the substitution of glycine for alanine at the second position at the N -terminus. As a result, teduglutide demonstrates resistance to degradation by dipeptidy l peptidase- IV (DPP -4) and therefore maintains a longer elimina tion half -life (t 1/2) in adults of approximately 2 hours compared to the native peptide, which has a t 1/2 of approximately 7 minutes. Teduglutide has been shown in animal studies and previous human clinical trials to increase villus height and cry pt depth in the intestinal epithelium, thereb y increasing the absorptive surface area of the intestines (Tappenden et al. 2013; Thymann et al. 2014 ). The European Commission granted a centralized marketing authorization valid throughout the European Union (EU) for tedu glutide ( REVESTIVE™) on 30 August 2012 and a New Drug Application (NDA) for teduglutide (G ATTEX®) was approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 21 December 2012 for the treatment of adult patients with SBS who are dependent o n PS. Teduglutide is not currently approved for use in pediatric subjects. For non-commercial use only"

In this study , teduglutide was administered to 3 cohorts of pediatric subjects from age s 1-17. Thirty -seven pediatric subjects received teduglutide at doses of 0.0125, 0.025, or 0.05 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks. Five additional pediatric subjects were enrolled in an observational standard of care (SOC) cohort. There were clear dose -dependent effects of teduglutide seen at the 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day doses compared to SOC and the 0.0125 mg/kg/day dose. In the 0.025 mg/kg/day cohort there was a reduction in PS volume a t Week 12 of 37%, including complete independence from PS support in 1 subject, and a reduction of 3.94 hours per day infusion time. I n the 0.05 mg/kg/day cohort there was a reduction in PS volume at Week 12 of 39%, including complete independence from PS support in 3 subjects, and a reduction of 4.18 hours per day infusion time. Teduglutide was generally safe and well tolerated by pediatric subjects in all dosing cohorts. There were no deaths during the study and no treatment -emergent serious adverse event s (TESAEs) related to teduglutide were reported. No discontinuations from study were due to adverse events (AEs). TED -C14-006 is an ongoing study which includes 2 treatment arms: a teduglutide treatment arm and a standard of care treatment arm. Subjects in both arms participate in a 2 -week minimum screening period, a 24 -week treatment period, and a 4- week follow -up period. During the screening period, subjects will choose into which arm to enroll. During the 24 -week treatment period, subjects in the SOC tre atment arm will receive standard medical therap y for SBS; while those in the teduglutide treatment arm will receive daily subcutaneous (SC) injections of teduglutide (stud y drug) in addition to standard medical therap y. The subjects enrolling in the tedugl utide treatment arm will be randomized 1:1 in a double -blinded manner into 2 parallel dose groups: 0.025 mg/kg/day or 0.05 mg/kg/day of teduglutide administered subcutaneousl y for 24 weeks.

In addition to evaluating the long- term safet y and durability of efficacy after 24 week s of treatment, this extension study will evaluate the need for additional teduglutide treatment in these subjects, and will allow for the first- time treatment of teduglutide -naïve subjects who participated in the SOC treatment arm in TED -C14-006. 2.2 Study Ob jectives 2.2.1 Primary Objectives The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long -term safet y and tolerability of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects with SBS who completed TED -C14-006. 2.2.2 Secondary Objectives The secondary objective of this stud y is to evaluate the long -term efficacy of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects with SBS who completed TED -C14-006.

At the time of entry into the TED- C14-006 study , subjects were less than 18 y ears of age, were dependent on parenteral nutrition to provide at least 30% of their caloric or fluid needs, and had not been able to significantly reduce PS for at least 3 months prior to enrollment. During the core study , pediatric subjects in the teduglutide treatment arm were randomized to 0.025 mg/kg or 0.05 mg/kg QD dosing in a double -blinded manner. The TED -C14-006 study will also be referred to as the core study interchangeabl y throughout this protocol. Approximately 28 subjects who complete the core study are expected to enroll in this extension study . Subjects who previousl y received teduglutide during TED -C14-006, as well as subjects who were in the SOC treatment group, may be eligible to receive teduglutide treatment in this extension study . To be eligible, subjects must meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria and none of the teduglutide treatment exclusion criteria. Re-challenge Subjects not receiving teduglutide treatment ( ie, in a “no teduglutide treatment period”), will be seen every 12 weeks for safet y, parenteral support (PS) requirements, and quality of life. At any point during a no teduglutide treatment period, subjects who meet ≥1 teduglutide treatment inclusion may proceed directl y to the pre -treatment visit if the investigator, subject, and parent agree to proceed with teduglutide therapy . Ration ale: Some pediatric subjects may have a durable beneficial effect after 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment and thus long -term follow -up without additional teduglutide treatment may be appropriate. However, there may be some pediatric subjects who deteriorat e or stop improving after discontinuation of teduglutide treatment. In these pediatric subjects, additional teduglutide treatment may be beneficial. Dose Selection Analy sis suggested that pediatric patients, ages 1 to 17 y ears old, are likel y to require the same dose as used in adults, namely 0.05 mg/kg/day (Mouksassi et al. 2009 ).In this extension study to TED -C14-006, repeat doses of teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg QD will be administered to eligible pediatric subjects who previously received teduglutide 0.05 or 0.025 mg/kg in Study TED -C14- 006. Rationale: Teduglutide is approved for adult use in the United States and European Union at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg SC once daily. The completed 12- week pediatric study (TED -C13-003) demonstrated that teduglutide dosing at 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day was associated with a favorable benefit/risk profile . In addition, population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations were conducted to determine the effective dose to be used in pediatric subjects using data from 8 adult clinical studies including adult Phase 1 studies and Phases 2/3 studies as well as th e pediatric study (TED -C13- 003) and suggested that the dose in pediatric subjects is likely to be same as the dose in adults (O'Keefe et al. 2006 ).

26,page_26,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 26 Protocol SHP633 -304 08April 2016 Duration of Treatment The duration of teduglutide treatment in this study mirrors that of the TED -C14-006 study , consisting of 24 weeks of tedugluti de treatment, followed by a 4-week follow -up period. The follow -up period is a mechanism to evaluate whether continued teduglutide is needed. If a subject deteriorates during the follow -up period, the subject may be evaluated immediately for additional ted uglutide treatment. Subjects who clinically deteriorate or stop improving at any time after the end of the follow- up period will also be assessed for additional treatment. Rationale: During the teduglutide treatment cycle, visit frequency is similar to frequencies performed in TED- C13-003 and TED -C14-006, to ensure sufficient safety monitoring and weaning of PS. During the No TED treatment, visits occur every 12 weeks, a frequency that is consistent with standard medical practices. Measures and Parameter s Following the review and signing of the informed consent (and informed assent, if applicable), screening visit procedures will begin including demographics, medical history , and short bowel syndrome history . Subjects who meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria may proceed to the pre -treatment visit. Afterthe pre -treatment visit, subjects who still meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria, and meet none of the teduglutide treatment exclusion criteria, will start a 28 -week cy cle, consisting of 24 weeks of teduglutide treatm ent at 0.05 mg/kg SC once daily , followed by a 4- week follow -up (no treatment) period ( Figure 3-1). During the 28 -week cycle, clinic visits will occur at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28. Phone vi sits are required approximately 1 week after adjustments in PS during the TED treatment period, between weeks 1- 24, and weekl y during the TED follow -up period, between weeks 24 and 28. Safety and PS requirements will be evaluated on a weekl y basis, and qua lity of life assessments will be made approximately every 12 weeks. At all site visits and telephone contacts, safety will be monitored and nutritional support will be reviewed and adjusted as needed. To maintain consistency across centers, all attempts sh ould be made to follow the nutritional support adjustment guidelines (developed with SBS expert input and provided in the protocol) for decisions regarding PS reduction and advances in enteral feeds based on weight gain, urine and stool output, and clinica l stability . Departure from the guidelines, however, is not considered a protocol deviation ( Appendix 1 ). Rationale: Measures of long term safety will include adverse events, growth parameters and anti-drug antibodies. Measure of long term efficacy will in clude durability of effect as measured by reduction in PS and improvement in pediatric quality of life measures (PedsQL, PedsQL Family Impact Module) . A reduction in PS volume of at least 20% at end of treatment ( EOT )was used as the primary endpoint in pi votal phase 3 adult clinical trials and the completed phase 3 pediatric study (TED -C13-003), and will be used as an endpoint in this extension study. In previous clinical studies, a reduction of this magnitude was associated with a reduction in the number of days per week of PS, and increases in enteral intake. Reduction in volume and time of PS due to improved enteral absorption may provide a pediatric subject with opportunities for more age -appropriate activities including oral rehabilitation. Quality of life assessments will be performed in this study to quantitate this effect. For non-commercial use only"

Study drug will be stored refr igerated at a temperature between 2 to 8°C (35.6 to 46.4°F) until dispensed to a subject. Once dispensed to a subject, the study drug can be stored refrigerated or up to a controlled room temperature (acceptable range of 2 to 25°C, or 35.6 to 77°F). Parent /guardian will be instructed to keep the subject’s study drug and sterile water diluent at controlled room temperature. If there are concerns that the controlled room temperature cannot be maintained, the stud y drug may be refrigerated. Investigational pro duct must be stored in accordance with labeled storage conditions. Temperature monitoring is required at the storage location to ensure that the investigational product is maintained within an established temperature range. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the temperature is monitored throughout the duration of the study and that records are maintained; the temperature should be monitored continuously by using either an in-house sy stem, a mechanical recording device such as a calibrated cha rt recorder, or b y manual means, such that both minimum and maximum thermometric values over a specific time period can be recorded and retrieved as required. Such a device ( ie, certified min/max thermometer) would require manual resetting upon each record ing. The sponsor must be notified immediately upon discovery of any excursion from the established range. Temperature excursions will require site investigation as to cause and remediation. The sponsor will determine the ultimate impact of excursions on the investigational product and will provide supportive documentation as necessary . Under no circumstances should the product be dispensed to subjects until the impact has been determined and the product is deemed appropriate for use b y the sponsor. The sponsor should be notified immediately if there are an y changes to the storage area of the investigational product that could affect the integrity of the product(s), eg, fumigation of a storage room. Investigational products are distributed b y the pharmacy or nominated member of the study team. The pharmacist/nominated team member will enter the unique subject identifier on the investigational product bottle/carton labels, as they are distributed. 6.4 Drug Accountability Investigators will be provided with suffic ient amounts of the investigational product to carry out this protocol for the agreed number of subjects. The investigator or designee will acknowledge receipt of the investigational product, documenting shipment content and condition. The investigator is to keep a current record of the inventory and dispensation of all clinical supplies. This record will be made available to the sponsor’s site monitor for the purpose of accounting for all clinical supplies. Any discrepancy or deficiency will be recorded and will include an explanation. All supplies sent to the investigator must be accounted for and in no case will clinical supplies be used in any unauthorized situation. The investigator has overall responsibility for administering/dispensing investigational product. Where permissible, tasks may be delegated to a qualified designee ( eg, a pharmacist) who is adequatel y trained in the protocol and who works under the direct supervision of the investigator. This delegation must be documented in the applicable st udy delegation of authority form.

Medical history for purposes of this extension study will consist of the following:  Adverse events that were ongoing at the time of completion of TED -C14-006  Events that occurred during the period between com pletion of TED -C14-006 and informed consent to SHP -633-304  Gestational age at birth and parental heights. This medical history information will supplement the medical history information collected at the start of the TED -C14-006 core stud y. If the subject has an y changes to the SBS history collected at the baseline visit of the TED -C14-006 study , that information (updated SBS history ) will be collected. 7.2.2 Physical Examination Physical examinations will be performed according to the study schedules. Any new c linicall y significant findings noted during ph ysical examinations should be recorded on the appropriate AE page of the eCRF. 7.2.3 Vital Signs, Body Weight, Height, Head Circumference and Body Mass Index (BMI) Vital signs will be measured according to the study schedules. Measurements will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), pulse (beats per minute), and body temperature (°C/°F). Blood pressure should be determined b y cuff (using the same method, the same arm, and in the same position throughou t the study ). For non-commercial use only"

Height (or length) and head circumference (for subjects ≤36 months of age) will be measured at selected visits. A height z- score, weight z -score, BM I, and BMI z -score will be calculated b y the sponsor using the site -provided height and weight data collected at each site visit New clinicall y significant vital sign abnormalities should be recorded on the appropriate AE page of the eCR F. 7.2.4 Clinical Laboratory Tests Safety laboratory tests to be performed at site visits consist of clinical chemistry , hematology , and urinal ysis and will be performed as outlined in the study plan ( Table 1-1, Table 1-2, and Table 1-3) Scheduled laboratory testing will be processed by a central lab. All laboratory assay s will be performed according to the central laboratory ’s normal procedures. Reference ranges are to be supplied by the laboratory . The investigator should assess out -of-range clinical laboratory values for clinical significance, indicating if the value(s) is/are not clinically significant or clinically significant. Abnormal clinical laboratory values, which are unexpected or not explained by the subject’s clinical condit ion, may , at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor, be repeated as soon as possible until confirmed, explained, or resolved. During the teduglutide treatment period, subjects will also have safet y labs within approximately 5-7 day s after a PS adju stment. Safety labs performed after PS adjustment and between site visits will consist of clinical chemistry and urinal ysis and may be processed by the central laboratory or a local laboratory . Local lab results will not be entered in the eCRFs; however, i f the local lab results indicate an y new clinically significant changes, they must be reported as an adverse event (see Section 8.1). For pediatric subjects in diapers, urine specimen collection should be attempted as part of the safet y labs, but lack of u rinaly sis will not constitute a protocol deviation.

Urine pregnancy tests will be administered at all other visits according to the study schedules, or if pregnancy is suspected, or as specified per protocol upon withdrawal of the subject from the study . 7.2.7 Antibody Testing Blood samples will be drawn for the anal ysis of positive/specific antibodies to teduglutide according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 -1,Table 1 -2,and Table 1 -3). Blood samples for antibodies may be drawn from a central line or f rom peripheral access. The sample drawn on CxD1 must be drawn prior to administration of the first dose of teduglutide. Once the subject has started teduglutide treatment, samples must be drawn at least 14 hours after dosing. Subjects who test positive/sp ecific for antibodies to teduglutide will also be tested for neutralizing antibody . Subjects who have been previousl y treated with teduglutide, and who test positive/specific for antibodies to teduglutide, will have follow -up blood draws for positive/speci fic antibodies to teduglutide every 12weeks while on stud y until a negative result is obtained. 7.2.8 Volume of Blood Efforts will be made to minimize the amount of blood drawn from all pediatric subjects enrolled in this study . The volumes of blood to be drawn from each subject will vary depending on clinical status. Approximate volumes of blood to be drawn from each subject annuall y are shown in the following table.

The amount of blood to be drawn may vary according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer or laboratory for an individual assessment. When more than 1 blood assessment is to be done at the time point/period, if they require the same t ype of tube, the assessments should be combined. Blood volume estimates do not include safet y labs performed after PS adjustment, and anti -teduglutide antibody testing du ring no -teduglutide treatment. 7.2.9 Gastrointestinal- specific Testing 7.2.9.1 Fecal Occult Blood Testing Fecal occult blood testing must be performed on all subjects at the pre-treatment visit, week 12, and week 24 of the teduglutide cy cle. During NTT periods, FOBT must be performed on teduglutide -exposed subjects (subjects who have received teduglutide an y time in the past and are therefore not teduglutide -naïve) on a roughl y annual basis (approximately every 48 -60 weeks). Actions to be taken in response to a posit ive FOBT are described below. 7.2.9.2 Colonoscopy Teduglutide -naïve subjects age 12 and older will undergo colonoscopy at the pre -treatment visit if one has not been performed within 1 y ear. Subjects of an y age with newly positive FOBT results at the pre -treatmen t visit for which a readil y detectable cause cannot be identified ( eg, anal fissure) will undergo a colonoscopy prior to receiving teduglutide. If newl y positive FOBT results (for which a readily detectable cause cannot be identified) are obtained at the e nd of a teduglutide treatment cy cle (CxW24/EOT), colonoscop y will be performed. The need for colonoscopy in response to positive FOBTs at an y other point during the study , or to re -evaluate persistently positive FOBTs is at the discretion of the investigat or. Teduglutide -exposed subjects who have received the equivalent of 2 treatment cy cles (48 weeks of study drug exposure) will undergo colonoscopy . While receiving additional teduglutide treatment, subjects will undergo colonoscop y at 5 year intervals or more often as needed. Upper endoscopy may be performed along with any colonoscopy at the investigator’s discretion. If a pol yp is found, adherence to current pol yp follow -up guidelines is recommended. Subjects with unresected GI pol yps, poly posis conditions, pre -malignant change or malignancy in the GI tract will be excluded from teduglutide treatment. 7.2.10 Nutritional Support Nutritional support includes PS, EN, and other food and fluids. Advances in EN and/or reductions to PS will be based on clinical status, including weight, linear growth, hy dration status, and safet y laboratory results. Intake and output diaries will include data to be considered in the adjustment of each subject’s nutritional support. Guidelines for nutritional support management and weani ng algorithms are provided in Appendix 1. 7.2.11 Intake Diary Intake diaries will be used to collect and evaluate each subject’s nutritional support. The subject/parent/guardian will complete the appropriate fields of the PS and enteral nutrition (formula) sectio ns of the intake diary 2 weeks prior to ALL scheduled site visits.

The following data will be captured in the intake diaries:  Parenteral support volume and infusion duration  Enteral nutrition (formula) volume  Site personnel will determine the actual PS and EN daily calories based on diary entries. 7.2.12 Output Diary Urine and stool output should be recorded in the output diary over a 48- hour period of PS and EN stability before every clinic visit; in addition, output should be recorded for subjects that are in a teduglutide treatment cy cle within 1 week of implementing a change in the PS prescription, regardless of previous teduglutide exposure. Urine data:  Toilet -trained subjects (who do not wear diapers)  Measure and record all urine output in mL or cc. The subject or parent will perform dipstick specifi c gravit y tests on the first urine produced after the daily infusions of PS. Nontoilet- trained subjects (who wear diapers)  Measure and record the weight of all urine -only diapers. Urine volume will be calculated using the following formula: 1 g (scale weig ht) = 1 mL or 1 cc At the discretion of the investigator, the parent may be asked to collect the first void after the daily PS infusion to measure specific gravit y. Stool data (includes diapers with mixed urine and stool):  Toilet -trained subjects WHO DO NO T WEAR DIAPERS Record the occurrence of each bowel movement and score the stool consistency using the Bristol Stool Form Scale (see Output diary )  Nontoilet- trained subjects WHO WEAR DI APERS Record the weight of diapers containing stool (including diapers with mixed urine and stool) as stool output and score the stool consistency using the Bristol Stool Form Scale (see Output diary ). Stool volume will be calculated using the formula: 1 g (scale weight)=1 mLor 1 cc All ostomy output volume should be recorde d. Ostomy output will not be scored using the Bristol scale. All diaries will be reviewed by the investigator or their designee at each clinic and telephone contact to assess clinical status and opportunity for PS reduction and advance in feeds. 7.2.13 Health -related Quality of Life Assessments Throughout the stud y, health -related quality of life assessments will be performed using the PedsQL Generic Core Scales.

The scales include self- repor ts for pediatric subjects and adolescents aged 5 to 18years and prox y-reports from parents of pediatric subjects aged 2 to 18 years. Field trials have shown that the internal consistency reliability of the PedsQL was excellent, with alphas for the generi c core scales in both self -and proxy -report greater than the 0.70 standard, and alphas for the full 23 -item scale approaching 0.90 for self -and prox y-report. Missing data were minimal. Item response distributions were across the full scale range, with no floor effects, and minimal ceiling effects. The validity of the PedsQL Generic Core Scales was demonstrated through known group comparisons, and correlations with other measures of disease burden. The PedsQL self-and proxy-report distinguished between p ediatric subjects with and without a chronic health condition, and within the group of pediatric subjects with a chronic condition, between those who did or did not have an overnight hospital visit in the last 12 months. Further, both child self - report and parent prox y-report correlated significantly with the number of days the child was too ill to pursue normal activities, needed someone to care for him or her, missed school in the last month, the number of day s the parent missed from work in the last mont h, and parent -report of problems pursuing their normal work routine and concentrating at work. The PedsQL Generic Core Scales are also responsive to clinical change, as demonstrated in field trials. 7.2.13.1 Pediatric Quality of Life Generic Core Scale (PedsQL™), A cute version The PedsQL Generic Core Scale is designed to measures health -related quality of life (HRQoL) in pediatric subjects and adolescents (2 -18 years of age).

The PedsQL Family Impact Module is a specific module of the PedsQL that is used to measure the impact of pediatric chronic health condit ions on parents and the family (Varni et al. 2004 ) . The 36- item PedsQL Family Impact Module consists of 6 scales measuring parent self -reported functioning as follows: 1) Physical Functioning (6 items), 2) Emotional Functioning (5 items), 3) Social Functioning (4 items), 4) Cognitive Fun ctioning (5 items; worries about treatment and disease), 5) Communication (3 items), 6) Worry (5items). Two additional scales measure parent - reported family functioning as follows: 1) Dail y Activities (3 items), and 2) Family Relationships (5 items). The PedsQL Family Impact Module should take the parent or legal guardian approximately 5 to 10 minutes to complete. 7.2.13.3 PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module (PedsQL™), Acute version The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Sy mptom Module is a disease -specific 58- item module , comprised of 10 differe nt symptom scales that assess gastrointestinal sy mptom -related quality of life: food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in poop, and diarrhea. The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Sy mptoms Module was designed to allow the selection and scoring of individual scales from the Module. The scales of Food and Drink L imits (6 items) and Diarrhea (7 items) were identified as clinically relevant and appropriate for th e symptoms experienced in this pediatric study population, and therefore, are the onl y scales used in this study . The scales will be completed by either the parent or legal guardian and subject as indicated in Table 7 -2at the time points outlined in Table 1-1, Table 1 - 2, and Table 1 - 3.

An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (ICH Guidance E2A 1995). All AEs are collected from the time the informed consent is signed until the defined follow -up period stated in Section 7.1. 4. This includes events occurring during the screening phase of the study , regardless of whether or not investigational product is administered. Where possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of sy mptoms should be recorded. If a diagnosis has not been made , then each s ymptom should be listed individually . All AEs should be captured on the appropriate AE pages in the eCRF and in source documents. In addition to untoward AEs, unexpected benefits outside the investigational product indication should also be ca ptured on the AE eCRF. All AEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline status or all variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the study . Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved (the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event), or the event is otherwise explained. When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of event(s) can be documented. 8.1.1 Severity Categorization The severit y of AEs must be recorded during the course of the event including the start and stop dates for each change in severity. An event that changes in severity should be captured as a new event. Worsening of pre -treatment events, after initiation of investigational product, must be recorded as new AEs (for example, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dy spepsia prior to dosing of investigational product, but the dy spepsia becomes severe and more frequent after first dose of investigational product has been administered, a new AE of severe dy spepsia [with the appropriate date of onset] is recorded on the appropriate eCRF). The medical assessment of severit y is determined by using the following definitions: Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generall y interfere with usual activities of daily living. Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject. Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. For non-commercial use only"
51,page_51,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 51 Protocol SHP633 -304 08April 2016 Note that the severity of AEs that constitute dose interruption criteria will also be evaluated using the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Common Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading criteria ( Table 8-1). 8.1.2 Relationship Categorization A phy sician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or h er medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused b y the investigational product. If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related”. Otherwise, if there is any valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related”. The causality assessment must be docum ented in the source document. The following additional guidance may be helpful: Term Relationship Definition RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or suspected response pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained by the subject’s medical condition, other therapies, or accident. Not RelatedThe event can be readily explained by other factors such as the subject’s underly ing medical condition, concomitant therap y, or accident and no plausible temporal or biologic relationship exists between the investigational product and the event. AEs that are related to study drug that are not resolved at EOT will be followed until the event resol ves or stabilizes, as judged b y the investigator. Laboratory values, vital signs, and clinical findings at the scheduled ph ysical examinations must be reported as AEs if the investigator considers the finding to be a clinicall y significant change from the baseline. 8.1.3 Outcome Categorization The outcome of AEs must be recorded during the course of the stud y in the eCRF. Outcomes are as follows: Fatal Not Recovered/Not Resolved Recovered/Resolved Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  Recovering/Resolving  Unknown For non-commercial use only"
52,page_52,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 52 Protocol SHP633 -304 08April 2016 8.1.4 Symptoms of the Disease under Study Symptoms of the disease under study should not be classed as AEs as long as they are within the normal day -to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease and are part of the efficacy data to be collected in th e study ; however, significant worsening of the s ymptoms should be recorded as an AE. 8.1.5 Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Evaluations A change in the value of a clinical laboratory or vital sign can represent an AE if the change is clinically relevant or i f, during the stud y, a shift of a parameter is observed from a normal value to an abnormal value, or a further worsening of an alread y abnormal value. When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the reference range, the duration until return to the reference range, either while continuing treatment or after the end of treatment with the investigational product, and the range of variation of the respective parameter within its reference range, must be taken into consideration. If, during the study , there are abnormal clinical laboratory values or vital signs which were not present at the beginning of the study , further investigations should be performed until the values return to within the reference range or until a plausible explanation ( eg, concomitant disease) is found for the abnormal values. The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory or vital sign is clinicall y significant and therefore repr esents an AE. 8.1.6 Pregnancy All pregnancies are to be reported from the time informed consent is signed until the defined follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.4. Any report of pregnancy for any female study participant must be reported within 24 hours to the Shire Global Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department using the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form. A copy of the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form (and any applicable follow - up report s) must also be sent to the Shire Medical Monitor using the details specified in the emergency contact information section of the protocol. I n the event a subject becomes pregnant during the stud y, teduglutide administration must be discontinued immediatel y. Every effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome and condition of the infant. It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain this information within 30 calendar day s after the initial notification and approximat ely 30 calendar day s post partum. Pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clinical Study Adverse Event Form for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and N on-serious AEs as Required b y the Protocol. Note: An elective abortion is not considered an SAE. In addition to the above, if the investigator determines that the pregnancy meets serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE using the Shire Clinical Stud y Adverse Event Form for SAEs and Non-serious AEs as Required by the Protocol as well as the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form.

Note: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply to reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless these resu lt in an SAE. The categories below are not mutually exclusive; the event can meet more than 1 category .  Abuse – Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of investigational product when used for a non -medical purpose ( eg, to alter one’s state of consciousness or get high) in a manner that may be detrimental to the individual and/or society .  Misuse – Intentional use of investigational product other than as directed or indicated at an y dose (Note: this includes a situation where the investigational product is not used as directed at the dose prescribed b y the protocol).  Overdose – Administration of a dose greater than the allocated dose of the study medication or at a frequency greater than the dosing interval specified by the protocol.  Medication Error –An error made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and/or use of an investigational product. For studies, m edication errors are reportable to the sponsor only as defined below.  Cases of subjects missing doses of the investigational product are not considered reportable as medication errors.  Medication errors should be collected/reported for all products under investigation.  The administration and/or use of an expired investigational product should be considered as a reportable medication error. All investigational product provided to pediatric subjects should be supervised by the parent/legall y-authorized representative/caregiver. 8.2 Serious Adverse Event Procedures 8.2.1 Reference Safety Information The reference for safet y information for this study is the investigator brochure which the sponsor has provided under separate cover to all investigators. 8.2.2 Reporting Proced ures All initial and follow -up SAE reports must be reported by the investigator to the Shire Global Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department andthe Shire Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. Note: The 24- hour report ing requirement for SAEs does not apply to reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors (see Section 8.1.7) unless they result in an SAE. All Adverse Events of Special Interest , as defined in Section 8.3, must be reported by the investigator to the Shire Global Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department and the Shire Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event even if the event does not fulfill seriousness criterion.

Note: The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of ""serious"" refers to an event in which t he subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. Note: Hospitalizatio ns, which are the result of elective or previousl y scheduled surgery for pre existing conditions, which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not be classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a previousl y scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from a hospitalization for an elective or previousl y scheduled surgery that meet(s) serious criteria must be reported as SAE(s). Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity Is a congenital abnormality /birth defect Is an important medical event. Note: I mportant medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgm ent, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study ) are collected from the time the subject signs the informed consent until the defined follow- up period stated in Section 7.1.4, and must be reported to the Shire Global Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Depar tment andthe Shire Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. In addition, any SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by the investigator at an y interval after the study has completed must be reported to the Shire Global For non-commercial use only"

The resolution date is the date the event no longer meets serious criteria, the date the s ymptoms resolve, or the event is considered chronic. I n the case of hospitalizations, the hospital admission and discharge dates are considered the onset and resolution dates, respectivel y. In addition, any signs or sy mptoms experienced by the subject after signing the informed consent form, or leading up to the onset date of the SAE, or following the resolution date of the SAE, must be recorded as an AE, if appropriate. 8.2.6 Fatal Outcome Any SAE that results in the subject’s dea th (ie, the SAE was noted as the primary cause of death) must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution date. For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded. For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless another investigational product action was previously taken ( eg, drug interrupted, reduced, withdrawn), the action taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not changed” or “not applicable” (if the subject never received investigational product). The investigational product action of “withdrawn” should not be s elected solel y as a result of the subject’s death. 8.2.7 Regulatory Agency, Institutional Review Board, Ethics Committee, and Site Reporting The Sponsor and/or Clinical Contract Research Organization ( CRO )is responsible for notify ing the relevant regulatory authorities, and US central Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs)/EU central ethics committees ( ECs ),of related, unexpected SAEs. In addition, the Clinical CRO is responsible for notify ing active sites of all related, unexpected SAEs occurring during all interventional studies across the SHP633 program. The investigator is responsible for notifying the local IRB, local EC, or the relevant local regulatory author ity of all SAEs that occur at his or her site as required. 8.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest An AE of special interest is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program and for which ongoing mo nitoring and immediate notification by the investigator to the sponsor is required. The AEs of special interest that require expedited regulatory reporting include the following:  Growth of pre -existing poly ps of the colon  Benign neoplasia of the GI tract including the hepatobiliary system  Tumor -promoting ability ( eg, benign and/or malignant neoplasia of any kind, not limited to those of the GI or hepatobiliary system) For non-commercial use only"

Attempts should be made to contact the sponsor/designee prior to dose interruption. Reasons for dosage interruptions may include but are not limited to hospitalization, incidents of certain AEs, SAEs co nsidered to be related to the study drug, a lapse in investigational product delivery , etc. Study drug must be permanently discontinued if any of the following events occur:  Pregnancy  Severe h ypersensitivity , such as anaph ylaxis determined by the investiga tor to be related to stud y drug. This does not include anti -teduglutide antibodies, mild injection site reactions or mild symptoms that according to the investigator do not pose a significant risk to the subject.  An AE listed in ( Table 8-1) that is of NCI CTCAE severit y Grade 3 or 4 and considered to be related to study drug administration  Confirmed drug -induced liver injury (DILI) related to teduglutide (See Section 8.4.2) 8.4.1 Dose Interruption Criteria Based on Known or Possible Risks of Teduglutide The investigational product may be discontinued if the subject has an AE listed in Table 8-1 that is of severit y ≥Grade 3 per the NCI CTCAE. All such AEs should be discussed with Shire’s medical monitor as soon as possible. Teduglutide administration must be permanentl y discontinued if the AE is considered related to the investigational product. The length of the dose interruption, and whether teduglutide administration resumes or is discontinued, depends on the clinical situation. Investigators and the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) should be guided by the descriptions of Grade 3 and 4 events, as they relate to known and possible risks associated with the administration of teduglutide.

Subjects are assigned a unique identify ing number; however, their initials and date of birth may also be collected and used to assist the sponsor to verify the accuracy of the data ( eg, to confirm that laboratory results have been assigned to the correct subject). The results of studies –containing subjects’ unique identify ing number, relevant medical records, and possibly initials and dates of birth –will be recorded. They may be transferred to, and used in, other countries which may not afford the same level of protection that applies within the countries where this study is conducted. The purpose of an y such transfer would includ e: to support regulatory submissions, to conduct new data anal yses to publish or present the study results, or to answer questions asked by regulatory or health authorities.

69,page_69,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 69 Protocol SHP633 -304 08April 2016 10.5 Study Results / Publication Policy Shire will endeavor to publish the results of a ll qualify ing, applicable, and covered studies according to external guidelines in a timely manner regardless of whether the outcomes are perceived as positive, neutral, or negative. Additionally, Shire adheres to external guidelines ( eg, Good Publication Practices 2) when forming a publication steering committee, which is done for large, multicenter Phase 2 -4 and certain other studies as determined b y Shire. The purpose of the publication steering committee is to act as a non- commercial body that advises or decides on dissemination of scientific study data in accordance with the scope of this policy . All publications relating to Shire products or projects must undergo appropriate technical and intellectual propert y review, with Shire agreement to publish prior to release of information. The review is aimed at protecting the sponsor’s proprietary information existing either at the commencement of the study or generated during the study . To the extent permitted by the publisher and cop yright law, the princip al investigator will own (or share with other authors) the copy right on his/her publications. To the extent that the principal investigator has such sole, joint or shared rights, the principal investigator grants the sponsor a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to make and distribute copies of such publications. The term “publication” refers to an y public disclosure including original research articles, review articles, oral presentations, abstracts and posters at medical congresses, journal suppl ements, letters to the editor, invited lectures, opinion pieces, book chapters, electronic postings on medical/scientific websites, or other disclosure of the study results, in printed, electronic, oral or other form. Subject to the terms of the paragraph below, the investigator shall have the right to publish the study results, and any background information provided by the sponsor that is necessary to include in an y publication of study results, or necessary for other scholars to verify such stud y results . Notwithstanding the foregoing, no publication that incorporates the sponsor’s confidential information shall be submitted for publication without the sponsor’s prior written agreement to publish, and shall be given to the sponsor for review at least 60 d ays prior to submission for publication. If requested in writing by Shire, the institution and principal investigator shall withhold submission of such publication for up to an additional 60 day s to allow for filing of a patent application. If the stud y ispart of a multicenter study , the first publication of the study results shall be made by the sponsor in conjunction with the sponsor’s presentation of a joint, multicenter publication of the compiled and analy zed study results. If such a multicenter publi cation is not submitted to a journal for publication by the sponsor within an 18-month period after conclusion, abandonment, or termination of the study at all sites, or after the sponsor confirms there shall be no multicenter study publication of the stud y results, an investigator may individually publish the study results from the specific site in accordance with this section. The investigator must, however, acknowledge in the publication the limitations of the single -site data being presented. Unless otherwise required by the journal in which the publication appears, or the forum in which it is made, authorship will comply with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors current standards. Participation as an investigator does not confer an y rights to authorship of publications. For non-commercial use only"

Please consider the following clinical parameters identified as markers for adequate management of pediatric SBS. These parameters should also be considered for managing nutritional support (PS and/or oral/enteral feeding) in terms of volume and calories during the treatment period. Growth trajectory , including weight, height (or length), and head circumference (for pediatric subjects up to 36 months of age) Other clinical evaluations Normal serum electrol ytes Stable blood urea nitrogen /creatinine levels Decrease in stool frequency or volume, including mixed output Stool consistency (ie, Bristol Stool Scale) Urine specific gravit y General consideration to possible clinical deterioration in SBS Inability to maintain weight and growth velocity Diarrhea ( ≥10 bowel movements per day , ≥80 mL/kg/day from an ostomy, or ≥75mL/kg/day mixed output) Colic/vomiting frequency increased Electrol yte changes or imbalance Skin breakdown  Adjustments should be based on the actual nutritional support in volume and calories the subject infuses. Subjects should remain compliant with the nutritional support prescription in volume and calories during the study .  Nutritional suppor t constituents may be adjusted at the discretion of the investigator.  During the 48 -hour Intake/Output measurement period prior to the subject’s scheduled visit, no further changes to the prescribed nutritional support should be made.  If there is a change in EN or other food or fluid intake, the investigator should consider this when adjusting the PS/EN support in volume and calories.

This study will enroll up to as many subjects as complete the TED -C14-006 study. Investigator(s): Multicenter study Site(s) and Region(s): Approximately 28 investigational sites in North America and Europe w ill participate in this extension study Study period (planned): October 2016 –September 2019Clinical phase: 3 Extension Objectives: Prim ary: To evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects w ith SBS. Secondary: To evaluate long -term efficacy of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects with SBS. Rationale: This is a Phase 3, prospective, open -label, long -term extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of teduglutide in pediatric subjects with short bow el syndrome (SBS) w ho completed the TED -C14-006 study (the core study). In addition to evaluating t he long -term safety and durability of efficacy after 24 -weeks of treatment, this extension study will evaluate the need for additional teduglutide treatment in these subjects, and w ill allow the study of first -time treatment of teduglutide -naïve subjects w ho participated in the standard of care (SOC) treatment arm in TED -C14-006. Investigational product, dose, and m ode of administration: This study will allow repeat doses of teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) once daily (QD) injection for eligible p ediatric subjects. There is no active comparator or reference product. Methodology: This is a Phase 3, prospective, open -label, long-term extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of teduglutide in pediatric subjects who completed the TED -C14-006 study (core study). Once the informed consent (and if applicable, informed assent) have been reviewed and signed , dem ographics, and updates to medical history and short bow el syndrome history will be obtained .Subjects not receiving teduglutide treatment (ie, in a no -teduglutide treatment [NTT] perio d), w ill be seen approximately every 12 weeks for safety, parenteral support (PS) requirements, and quality of life. The first NTT visit after the screening visit will occur within 2 to 12 w eeks of the screening visit . At any point after screening, including during a NTT period, subjects who meet ≥1 teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria , may proceed immediately to the pre-treatment visit if the investigator, subject, and parent agree to proc eed with teduglutide therapy . After the pre -treatment visit, subjects who meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria, and meet none of the teduglutide treatment exclusion criteria, will start a 28 -week cycle, consisting of 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment at 0.05 mg/kg SC once daily, followed by a 4 -week follow -up period (during which no teduglutide is administered) (Figure 3 -1). During the 28 -week cycle, clinic visits will occur at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28. Phone visits are required approximately 1 w eek after adjustments in PS during the teduglutide treatment period (betw een weeks 1 and 24), and w eekly during the teduglutide follow -up period (between weeks 24 and 28).Safety and PS requirements will be evaluated at every visi t, and quality of life assessments will be m ade approximately every 12 weeks.

91,page_91,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 16 Protocol SHP633 -304 Version 2 / 22Nov 2016 after stopping teduglutide, the subject may ""escape"" the follow -up period early and proceed imm ediately to another pre -treatment visit. Follow ing completion of the 28 -week treatment cycle, the subject w ill proceed to an NTT visit within approximately 12 w eeks. Atallsitevisits andtelephone contacts, safety willbemonitored andnutritional suppor twillbereviewed and adjusted asneeded. Tomaintain consistency across centers, allattempts should bemade tofollow thenutritional support adjustment guidelines (developed withSBS expert input andprovided intheprotocol) fordecisions regarding PSsupport reduction andadvances inenteral feeds based onweightgain, urine andstool output, and clinical stability. Departure from theguidelines, however, isnotconsidered aprotocol deviation. (Appendix 2). Study Design Flow Chart Figure legend: Safety and efficacy data for subjects not receiving teduglutide treatment are captured approximately every 12 weeks, but subjects may proceed to the pre -treatment visit at any time in order to assess eligibility for teduglutide therapy. Elig ible subjects will enter a 28 -week teduglutide cycle. During this cycle, subjects will return to the site for safety and efficacy assessments at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, and 24 ( solid black lines ). Phone visits are required approximately 1 week aft er adjustments in PS during the intervening weeks between weeks 2 and 24 ( dashed grey lines ). Subjects discontinue teduglutide at week 24 and enter a 4 -week follow -up (no-treatment) period, during which phone visits will be performed weekly ( solid grey lin es). If an escape criterion is met during the follow -up period, subjects may proceed directly to another pre -treatment visit. Study Inclusion Criteria: The subject will be considered eligible for the study if they meet allof the study inclusion criteria.

I t is estimated that, at most, there are a few hundred pediatric subjects 1 y ear and older with SBS (Khan et al. 2015; Wales et al. 2004 ) .Unlike the adult population, the majority of cases of SBS in pediatr ic subjects are due to congenital anomalies or catastrophic events that occur during infancy . Although the small intestine is capable of remarkable adaptation, excessive loss of absorptive surface area or specialized functions can lead to dependence on par enteral nutrition or intravenous (IV) fluids (parenteral support [PS]). Treatment of both pediatric and adult patients is focused on achieving adequate intestinal absorption to allow for minimization or discontinuation of PS. About 30% of infants with SBS become independent of PS requirements within12months of the initial insult , and an additional 10% wean off PS within 24 months. After this time, linear intestinal growth slows. About 60% of pediatric subjects with SBS are able to become independent of PS within 5 y ears of the initial diagnosis (Khan et al. 2015). Nevertheless, despite optimal medical man agement, many pediatric subjects remain dependent on PS. Complications of long -term PS include liver disease, catheter -related blood stream infections, central line -associated venous thrombosis and dwindling central venous access. Sepsis is the leading cau se of death in these patients and quality of life is poor (Squires et al. 2012 ).Accelerating the adaptive process and achieving enteral autonomy is an urgent goal for all patients with SBS who are dependent on PS (Khan et al. 2015; Squires et al. 2012 ). Intestinal adaptation is driven by hormonal cues in response to nutrient mala bsorption (Drucker and Yusta 2014). Chief among these is hormones glucagon -like peptide 2 (GL P-2), which is secreted from L- type enteroendocrine cells that reside in the intestinal epithelium in the ileum and colon. Re section of these regions may impair the adaptive r esponse b y limiting endogenous production of GLP -2. 1.2 Product Background Teduglutide is a novel, recombinant analog of naturally occurring human GLP-2 that regulates the functional and structural integrit y of the cells lining the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Teduglutide is a 33-amino acid peptide that differs from native GLP -2 in the substitution of glycine for alanine at the second position at the N -terminus. As a result, teduglutide demonstrates resistance to degradation by dipeptidy l peptidase -IV (DPP -4) and therefore maintains a longer elimination half-life (t1/2) in adults of approximately 2 hours compared to the native peptide, which has a t1/2 of approximately 7 m inutes. Teduglutide has been shown in animal studies and previous human clinical trials to increase villus height and crypt depth in the intestinal epithelium, thereby increasing the absorptive surface area of the intestines (Tappenden et al. 2013; Thymann et al. 2014). The European Commission granted a centralized marketing authorization valid throughout the European Union (EU) for teduglutide (Revestive™) on 30 August 2012 and a New Drug Application (NDA) for teduglutide (Gattex®) was approved by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 21December 2012 for the treatment of adult patients with SBS who are dependent on PS. Teduglutide has also been approved for use in adult patients with SBS in Canada and Switzerland. On 29 Jun 2016, the For non-commercial use only"

In this study , teduglutide was administered to 3 cohorts of pediatric subjects from age s 1-17. Thirty -seven pediatric subjects received teduglutide at doses of 0.0125, 0.025, or 0.05 mg/kg/day for 1 2 weeks. Five additional pediatric subjects were enrolled in an observational standard of care (SOC) cohort. There were clear dose -dependent effects of teduglutide seen at the 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day doses compared to SOC and the 0.0125 mg/kg/day dose. In the 0.025 mg/kg/day cohort there was a reduction in PS volume at Week 12 of 37%, including complete independence from PS support in 1 subject, and a reduction of 3.94 hours per day infusion time. I n the 0.05 mg/kg/day cohort there was a reduction in PS vo lume at Week 12 of 39%, including complete independence from PS support in 3 subjects, and a reduction of 4.18 hours per day infusion time. Teduglutide was generally safe and well tolerated by pediatric subjects in all dosing cohorts. There were no deaths during the study and no treatment - emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) related to teduglutide were reported. No discontinuations from study were due to adverse events (AEs). TED -C14-006 is an ongoing study which includes 2 treatment arms: a teduglutide treatment arm and a standard of care treatment arm. Subjects in both arms participate in a 2 -week minimum screening period, a 24 -week treatment period, and a 4- week follow -up period. During the screening period, subjects will choose into which arm to enro ll. During the 24 -week treatment period, subjects in the SOC treatment arm will receive standard medical therap y for SBS; while those in the teduglutide treatment arm will receive daily subcutaneous (SC) injections of teduglutide (stud y drug) in addition to standard medical therap y. The subjects enrolling in the teduglutide treatment arm will be randomized 1:1 in a double- blinded manner into 2 parallel dose groups: 0.025 mg/kg/day or 0.05 mg/kg/day of teduglutide administered subcutaneousl y for 24 weeks.

In addition to evaluating the long- term safet y and durability of efficacy after 24 weeks of treatment, this extension study will evaluate the need for additional teduglutide treatment in these subjects, and will allow for the first- time treatment of teduglutide -naïve subjects who participated in the SOC treatment arm in TED -C14-006. 2.2 Study Objectives 2.2.1 Primary Objectives The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long -term safet y and tolerability of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects with SBS who completed TED -C14-006. 2.2.2 Secondary Objectives The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the long -term efficacy of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects with SBS who completed TED -C14- 006.

At the time of entry into the TED- C14-006 study , subjects were less than 18 y ears of age, w ere dependent on parenteral nutrition to provide at least 30% of their caloric or fluid needs, and had not been able to significantly reduce PS for at least 3 months prior to enrollment. During the core study , pediatric subjects in the teduglutide treatmen t arm were randomized to 0.025 mg/kg or 0.05 mg/kg once daily (QD) dosing in a double -blinded manner. The TED -C14-006 study will also be referred to as the core stud y interchangeably throughout this protocol. Approximately 34 subjects who complete the core study are expected to enroll in this extension study . Subjects who previously received teduglutide during TED -C14-006, as well as subjects who were in the SOC treatment group, may be eligible to receive teduglutide treatment in this extension study . To be eligible, subjects must meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria and none of the teduglutide treatment exclusion criteria. Additional Teduglutide Treatment Subjects not receiving teduglutide treatment ( ie, in a “no- teduglutide treatment period”), will be seen approximately every 12 weeks for safety , parenteral support (PS) requirements, and qualit y of life. At an y point during a no -teduglutide treatment period, subjects who meet ≥1 teduglutide treatment inclusion may proceed directl y to the pre -treatment visit if the investigator, subject, and parent agree to proceed with teduglutide therapy . Rationale: Some pediatric subjects may have a durable beneficial effect after 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment and thus long - term follow -up without additional teduglutide treatment may be appropriate. However, there may be some pediatric subjects who deteriorate or stop improving after discontinuation of teduglutide treatment. In these pediatric subjects, additional teduglutide t reatment may be beneficial. Dose Selection Analy sis suggested that pediatric patients, ages 1 to 17 y ears old, are likel y to require the same dose as used in adults, namely 0.05 mg/kg/day (Mouksassi et al. 2009 ).In this extension study to TED -C14-006, repeat doses of teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg QD will be administered to eligible pediatric subjects who previously received teduglutide 0.05 or 0.025 mg/kg in Study TED -C14- 006. Rationale: Teduglutide is approved for adult use in the US and E U, and for pediatric use in the EU,at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg SC once daily. The completed 12 -week pediatric study (TED- C13- 003) demonstrated that teduglutide dosing at 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day was associated with a favorable benefit/risk profile. In addition, population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations were conducted to determine the effective dose to be used in pediatric sub jects using data from 8adult clinical studies including adult Phase 1 studies and Phases 2/3 studies as well as the For non-commercial use only"

Duration of Treatment The duration of teduglutide treatment in this study mirrors that of the TED -C14-006 study , consisting of 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment, followed by a 4-week follow -up period. The follow -up period is a mechanism to evaluate whether continued teduglutide is needed. If a subject deteriorates during the follow -up period, the subj ect may be evaluated immediately for additional teduglutide treatment. Subjects who clinically deteriorate or stop improving at any time after the end of the follow- up period will also be assessed for additional treatment. Rationale: During the teduglutide treatment cycle, visit frequency is similar to frequencies performed in TED- C13-003 and TED -C14-006, to ensure sufficient safety monitoring and weaning of PS. During the no- teduglutide treatment, visits occur every 12 weeks, a frequency that is consistent with standard medical practices. Measures and Parameters Following the review and signing of the informed consent (and informed assent, if applicable), screening visit procedures will begin including demographics, and updates to medical history and SBS history . Subjects who meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria may proceed to the pre -treatment visit. Afterthe pre -treatment visit, subjects who still meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria, and meet none of the teduglutide treatment exclusion criteria, will start a 28 -week cy cle, consisting of 24 weeks of teduglutide treatm ent at 0.05 mg/kg SC once daily , followed by a 4- week follow -up (no treatment) period ( Figure 3-1). During the 28 -week cycle, clinic visits will occur at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28. Phone visits are required approximately 1 week after adjustments in PS during the teduglutide treatment period ( between weeks 1-24), and weekl y during the teduglutide follow -up period (between weeks 24 and 28 ). Safety and PS requirements will be evaluated on a weekl y basis, and quality of life assessments will be made approximately every 12 weeks. At all site visits and telephone contacts, safety will be monitored and nutritional support will be reviewed and a djusted as needed. To maintain consistency across centers, all attempts should be made to follow the nutritional support adjustment guidelines (developed with SBS expert input and provided in the protocol) for decisions regarding PS reduction and advances in enteral feeds based on weight gain, urine and stool output, and clinical stability . Departure from the guidelines, however, is not considered a protocol deviation ( Appendix 2 ). Rationale: Measures of long term safety will include adverse events, growth parameters and anti-drug antibodies. Measure of long term efficacy will include durability of effect as measured by reduction in PS and improvement in pediatric quality of life measures (PedsQL, PedsQL Family Impact Module). A reduction in PS volume of at least 20% at end of treatment ( EOT )was used as the primary endpoint in pivotal phase 3 adult clinical trials and the completed phase 3 pediatric study (TED -C13-003), and will be used as an endpoint in this extension study. In previous clinical studies, a reduction of this magnitude was associated with a reduction in the For non-commercial use only"

Reduction in volume and time of PS due to improved enteral absorption may provide a pediatric subject with opportunities for more age -appropriate activities including oral rehabilitation. Quality of life assessments will be performed in this study to quantitate this effect. Teduglutide has been found to have a targeted intestinotrophic effect. Taking into account the patient pop ulation and the pharmacologic effect of teduglutide, GI -specific screening tests, including fecal occult blood testing and colonoscopy /sigmoidoscopy , which are commonl y part of the routine care of these subjects, will be performed to ensure safet y. This st udy captures long - term safet y data on polyps and other colonic mucosal changes in teduglutide -exposed subjects using the surveillance strategy proposed in Section 7.2.9 . Figure 3-1: Study Design Flow Chart Figure legend: Safety and efficacy data for subjects not receiving teduglutide treatment are captured approximately every 12weeks, but subjects may proceed to the pre -treatment visit at any time in order to assess eligibility for teduglutide therapy. Eligible subjects will enter a 28 -week teduglutide cycle. During this cycle, subjects will return to the site for safety and efficacy assessments at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, and 24 ( solid black lines ). Phone visits are required approximately 1 week af ter adjustments in PS during the intervening weeks between weeks 2 and 24 ( dashed grey lines ). Subjects discontinue teduglutide at week 24 and enter a 4 -week follow-up (no -treatment) period, during which phone visits will be performed weekly ( solid grey lines). If an escape criterion is met during the follow -up period, subjects may proceed directly to another pre -treatment visit. 3.2 Duration and Study Completion Definition A subject will be considered enrolled in the stud y once the subject has provided signed consent, and meets all of the Inclusion Criteria. The study will continue for at least 1 y ear and until each subject has access, as needed, to teduglutide. The subject’s maximum duration of participation is expected to be approximately 3 years. The study will be completed in approximately 40 months. A subject will be considered as having completed the study if the subject has not withdrawn early from the stud y for any re ason prior to completing the End of Study (EOS) visit. The study completion date is defined as the date the final subject, across all sites, completes their final protocol -defined assessment.

L imited responsibility may be delegated to the pharmacy or member of the stud y team, but this delegation must be documented. Study drug must be kept in a locked area with access restricted to specific study personnel. Study drug will be stored refrigerated at a temperature between 2 to 8°C (35.6 to 46.4°F) until dispensed to a subject. Once dispensed to a subject, the study drug can be stored refrigerated or up to a controlled room temperature (acceptable range of 2 to 25°C, or 35.6 to 77°F). Parent/guardian will be instructed to keep the subject’s stud y drug and sterile water diluent at controlled room temperature. If there are c oncerns that the controlled room temperature cannot be maintained, the stud y drug may be refrigerated. The study drug is for single use only , and should be used within 3 hours following reconstitution. Investigational product must be stored in accordance w ith labeled storage conditions. Temperature monitoring is required at the storage location to ensure that the investigational product is maintained within an established temperature range. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the temperature is monitored throughout the duration of the study and that records are maintained; the temperature should be monitored continuously by using either an in-house sy stem, a mechanical recording device such as a calibrated chart recorder, or by manual means, such that both minimum and maximum thermometric values over a specific time period can be recorded and retrieved as required. Such a device ( ie, certified min/max thermometer) would require manual resetting upon each recording. The sponsor must be notified i mmediately upon discovery of any excursion from the established range. Temperature excursions will require site investigation as to cause and remediation. The sponsor will determine the ultimate impact of excursions on the investigational product and will provide supportive documentation as necessary . Under no circumstances should the product be dispensed to subjects until the impact has been determined and the product is deemed appropriate for use b y the sponsor. The sponsor should be notified immediately if there are an y changes to the storage area of the investigational product that could affect the integrity of the product(s), eg, fumigation of a storage room. Investigational products are distributed b y the pharmacy or nominated member of the stud y team. The pharmacist/nominated team member will enter the unique subject identifier on the investigational product bottle/carton labels, as they are distributed. 6.4 Drug Accountability Investigators will be provided with sufficient amounts of the investigational product to carry out this protocol for the agreed number of subjects. The investigator or designee will acknowledge receipt of the investigational product, documenting shipment content and condition.

All laboratory assay s will be performed according t o the central laboratory ’s normal procedures. Reference ranges are to be supplied by the laboratory . The investigator should assess out-of- range clinical laboratory values for clinical significance, indicating if the value(s) is/are not clinically signific ant or clinically significant. Abnormal clinical laboratory values, which are unexpected or not explained by the subject’s clinical condition, may , at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor, be repeated as soon as possible until confirmed, explained , or resolved. During the teduglutide treatment period, subjects will also have safet y labs within approximately 5-7 day s after a PS adjustment. Safety labs performed after PS adjustment and between site visits will consist of clinical chemistry and urina lysis and may be processed by the central laboratory or a local laboratory. Local lab results are not required to be entered in the eCRFs; however, if the local lab results indicate an y new clinicall y significant changes, they must be reported as an advers e event (see Section 8.1). Urine specimen collection should be attempted as part of the safet y labs, but lack of urinalysis will not constitute a protocol deviation. New clinicall y significant labs should be reported as AEs.

Urine pregnancy tests will be administered at all other visits according to the study schedules, or if pregnancy is suspected, or as specified per protocol upon withdrawal of the subject from the study . 7.2.7 Antibody Testing Blood samples will be drawn for the anal ysis of antibodies to teduglutide according to the Schedule of Assessme nts (Table 1-1, Table 1 -2,and Table 1 -3). Blood samples for antibodies may be drawn from a central line or from peripheral access. The sample drawn on CxD1 must be drawn prior to administration of the first dose of teduglutide. Once the subject has started teduglutide treatment, samples must be drawn at least 14 hours after dosing. Subjects who test positive for antibodies to teduglutide will also be tested for neutralizing antibody . Subjects who have been previousl y treated with teduglutide, and who test positive for antibodies to teduglutide, will have follow- up blood draws for antibodies to teduglutide every 12 weeks while on study until a negative result is obtained. 7.2.8 Volume of Blood Efforts will be made to minimize the amount of blood drawn from all ped iatric subjects enrolled in this study .

Note: The amount of blood to be drawn for each assessment is an estimate. The amount of blood to be drawn may vary according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer or laboratory for an individual assessment. When more than 1 blood assessment is to be done at the time point/period, if they require the same t ype of tube, the assessments should be combined. Bloo d volume estimates do not include safet y labs performed after PS adjustment, and anti - teduglutide antibody testing during no- teduglutide treatment. 7.2.9 Gastrointestinal- specific Testing 7.2.9.1 Fecal Occult Blood Testing Fecal occult blood testing must be performed on all subjects at the pre -treatment visit, week 12, and week 24 of the teduglutide cy cle. During NTT periods, FOBT must be performed on teduglutide -exposed subjects (subjects who have received teduglutide an y time in the past and are therefore not tedugluti de-naïve) on a roughl y annual basis (approximately every 48 -60 weeks). Actions to be taken in response to a positive FOBT are described below. 7.2.9.2 Colonoscopy or Sigmoidoscopy Teduglutide -naïve subjects age 12 and older will undergo colonoscopy or sigmoidoscop yat the pre-treatment visit if one has not been performed within 1 y ear. Subjects of an y age with newly positive FOBT results at the pre -treatment visit for which a readil y detectable cause cannot be identified ( eg, anal fissure) will undergo a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscop yprior to receiving teduglutide. If newly positive FOBT results (for which a readil y detectable cause cannot be identified) are obtained at the end of a teduglutide treatment cycle (CxW24/EOT), colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy will be performed. The need for colonoscop yor sigmoidoscopy in response to positive FOBTs at any other point during the study , or to re -evaluate persistently positive FOBTs is at the discretion of the investigator. Teduglutide -exposed subjects who have received the equivalent of 2 treatment cy cles (48 weeks of study drug exposure) will undergo colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy . While receiving additional teduglutide treatment, subjects will undergo colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy at 5 y ear intervals or more ofte n as needed. Upper endoscopy may be performed along with any colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy at the investigator’s discretion. If a pol yp is found, adherence to current pol yp follow -up guidelines is recommended.

Advances in enteral nutrition and/or reductions t o PS will be based on clinical status, including weight, linear growth, hydration status, and safety laboratory results. Intake and output diaries will include data to be considered in the adjustment of each subject’s nutritional support. Guidelines for nu tritional support management and weaning algorithms are provided in Appendix 2 . 7.2.11 Diaries 7.2.11.1 Study Drug Administration Diary A study drug administration diary will record administration of teduglutide. This diary should be completed by the subject (or parent/ legal guardian, as applicable) daily during the teduglutide treatment period (between visits CxD1 and CxW24). 7.2.11.2 Intake Diary Intake diaries will be used to collect and evaluate each subject’s nutritional support. The subject/parent/guardian will complete the a ppropriate fields of the PS section of the intake diary 2 weeks prior to ALL scheduled site visits (except at pre-treatment visit) . During the 24-week teduglutide treatment period, the intake diary will also be completed for 1 week following PS adjustments. The intake diary will also be completed daily during the 4 -week follow -up period. The following data will be captured in the intake diaries: Parenteral support volume and infusion duration Site personnel will determine the actual PS daily calories based on diary entries. All available diary data will be reviewed by the investigator or their designee at each clinic and telephone visit to assess clinical status and opportunity for PS reduction and advance in feeds. 7.2.11.3 Output Diary Urine and stool output should be recorded in the output diary over a 48-hour period of nutritional stability before every clinic visit; in addition, output should be recorded for subjects that are in a teduglutide treatment cy cle within 1 week of implementing a change in the PS prescr iption, regardless of previous teduglutide exposure. Urine data: Toilet -trained subjects (who do not wear diapers) Measure and record all urine output in mL or cc Nontoilet- trained subjects (who wear diapers) Measure and record the weight of all urine -only diapers. Urine volume will be calculated using the following formula: 1 g (scale weight) = 1 mL or 1 cc At the discretion of the investigator, the parent may be asked to collect the first void after the daily PS infusion to measure specific gravity For non-commercial use only"

Each PedsQL age- appropriate form takes less than 4 minutes to complete. The scales include self- reports for pediatric subjects and adolescents aged 5 to 18years and prox y-repor ts from parents of pediatric subjects aged 2 to 18 years. Field trials have shown that the internal consistency reliability of the PedsQL was excellent, with alphas for the generic core scales in both self -and proxy -report greater than the 0.70 standard, and alphas for the full 23 -item scale approaching 0.90 for self -and prox y-report. Missing data were minimal. Item response distributions were across the full scale range, with no floor effects, and minimal ceiling effects. The validity of the PedsQL Gen eric Core Scales was demonstrated through known group comparisons, and correlations with other measures of disease burden. The PedsQL self-and proxy-report distinguished between pediatric subjects with and without a chronic health condition, and within the group of pediatric subjects with a chronic condition, between those who did or did not have an overnight hospital visit in the last 12 months. Further, both child self - report and parent prox y-report correlated significantly with the number of day s the child was too ill to pursue normal activities, needed someone to care for him or her, missed school in the last month, the number of day s the parent missed from work in the last month, and parent -report of problems pursuing their normal work routine and conc entrating at work. The PedsQL Generic Core Scales are also responsive to clinical change, as demonstrated in field trials. 7.2.12.1 Pediatric Quality of Life Generic Core Scale (PedsQL™), Acute version The PedsQL Generic Core Scale is designed to measures health -related quality of life (HRQoL) in pediatric subjects and adolescents (2 -18 years of age). The developmentally appropriate PedsQL Generic Core Scale will be completed by either the parent or legal guardian and subject as indicated in Table 7 -2at the time po ints as outlined in Table 1-1, Table 1 -2,and Table 1 - 3.

The Child and Parent Reports of the PedsQL Generic Core Scale for Young Pediatric subjects (ages 5 -7), Pediatric subjects (ages 8- 12), and Teens (ages 13 -18) are composed of 23 items comprising 4 dimensions as follows: 1) Physical Functioning (8 items), 2) Emotional Functioning (5 items), 3) Social Functioning (5 items), 4) School Functioning (5 items). 7.2.12.2 Pediatric Quality of Life Family Impact Module (PedsQL™), Acute version The PedsQL Family Impact Module is a parent -report multidimensional instrument that will be completed b y the parent or legal guardian, as outlined in Table 1-1, Table 1 -2, and Table 1 - 3. The PedsQL Family Im pact Module is a specific module of the PedsQL that is used to measure the impact of pediatric chronic health conditions on parents and the family (Varni et al. 2004 ). The 36- item PedsQL Family Impact Module consists of 6 scales measuring parent self -reported functioning as follows: 1) Physical Functioning (6 items), 2) Emot ional Functioning (5 items), 3) Social Functioning (4 items), 4) Cognitive Functioning (5 items; worries about treatment and disease), 5) Communication (3 items), 6) Worry (5items). Two additional scales measure parent - reported family functioning as follows: 1) Dail y Activities (3 items), and 2) Family Relationships (5 items). The PedsQL Family Impact Module should take the parent or legal guardian approximately 5 to 10 minutes to complete. 7.2.12.3 PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module (PedsQL™), Acute version ThePedsQL Gastrointestinal Sy mptom Module is a disease -specific 58- item module, comprised of 10 differe nt symptom scales that assess gastrointestinal sy mptom -related quality of life: food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in poop, and diarrhea. The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Sy mptoms Module was designed t o allow the selection and scoring of individual scales from the Module. The scales of Food and Drink L imits (6 items) and Diarrhea (7 items) were identified as clinically relevant and appropriate for the s ymptoms experienced in this pediatric study populat ion, and therefore, are the onl y scales used in this study .

An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (ICH Guidance E2A 1995). All AEs are collected from the time the informed consent is signed until the defined follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.4 . This includes events occurring during the screening phase of the study , regardless of whether or not investigational product is administered. Where possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of sy mptoms should be recorded. If a diagnosis has not been made, then each s ymptom should be listed individually . All AEs should be captured on the appropriate AE pages in the eCRF and in source documents. In addition to untoward AEs, unexpected benefits outside the investigational product indication should also be captured on the AE eCRF. All AEs must be followed to clo sure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline status or all variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the study . Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved (the i nvestigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event), or the event is otherwise explained. When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of event(s) can be documented. 8.1.1 Severity Categorization The severit y of AEs must be recorded during the course of the event including the start and stop dates for each change in severit y. An event that changes in severity should be captured as a new event. Worsening of pre -treatment events, after initiation of investigational product, must be recorded as new AEs (for example, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dy spepsia prior to dosing of investigational product, but the dy spepsia becomes severe and more frequent after first dose of investigational product has been administered, a new AE of severe dy spepsia [with the appropriate date of onset] is recorded on the appropriate eCRF). The medical assessment of severit y is determined by using the following definitions: Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generall y interfere with usual activities of daily living. Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention. The event interfer es with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject. Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. For non-commercial use only"
130,page_130,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 55 Protocol SHP633 -304 Version 2 / 22Nov 2016 Note that the severity of AEs that constitute dose interruption criteria will also be evaluated using the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading criteria (Table 8-1). 8.1.2 Relationship Categorization A phy sician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused b y the investigational product. If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related”. Otherwise, if there is an y valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a possible cause -and- effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related”. The causality assessment must be documented in the source document. The following additional guidance may be helpful: Term Relationship Definition RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or suspected response pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained by the subject’s medical condition, other therapies, or accident. Not RelatedThe event can be readily explained by other factors such as the subject’s underly ing medical condition, concomitant therap y, or accident and no plausible temporal or biologic relationship exists between the investigational product and the event. AEs that are related to study drug that are not resolved at EOT will be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes, as judged b y the investigator. Laboratory values, vital signs, and clinical findings at the scheduled ph ysical examinations must be reported as AEs if the investigator considers the finding to be a clinicall y significant change from the baseline. 8.1.3 Outcome Categorization The outcome of A Es must be recorded during the course of the study in the eCRF. Outcomes are as follows: Fatal Not Recovered/Not Resolved Recovered/Resolved Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae For non-commercial use only"
131,page_131,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 56 Protocol SHP633 -304 Version 2 / 22Nov 2016 Recovering/Resolving Unknown 8.1.4 Symptoms of the Disease under Study Symptoms of the disease under study should not be classed as AEs as long as they are within the normal day -to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease and are part of the efficacy data to be collected in the study; however, significant worsening of the s ympt oms should be recorded as an AE. 8.1.5 Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Evaluations A change in the value of a clinical laboratory or vital sign can represent an AE if the change is clinically relevant or if, during the study , a shift of a parameter is obser ved from a normal value to an abnormal value, or a further worsening of an alread y abnormal value. When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the reference range, the duration until return to the reference range, either while continuing tre atment or after the end of treatment with the investigational product, and the range of variation of the respective parameter within its reference range, must be taken into consideration. If, during the stud y, there are abnormal clinical laboratory values or vital signs which were not present at the beginning of the study , further investigations should be performed until the values return to within the reference range or until a plausible explanation ( eg, concomitant disease) is found for the abnormal value s. The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory or vital sign is clinicall y significant and therefore represents an AE. 8.1.6 Pregnancy All pregnancies are to be reported from the time informed consent is signed until the defined follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.4. Any report of pregnancy for any female study participant must be reported within 24 hours to the Shire Global Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department using the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form. A copy of the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form (and any applicable follow - up reports) must also be sent to the Shire Medical Monitor using the details specified in the emergency contact information section of the protocol. I n the event a subje ct becomes pregnant during the stud y, teduglutide administration must be discontinued immediately. Every effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome and condition of the infant. It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain this information within 30 calendar day s after the initial notification and approximately 30 calendar day s post partum.

Note: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply to reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless these result in an SAE. The categories below are not mutually exclusive; the event can meet more than 1 category . Abuse – Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of investigational product when used for a non -medical purpose ( eg, to alter one’s state of consciousness or get high ) in a manner that may be detrimental to the individual and/or society . Misuse –Intentional use of investigational product other than as directed or indicated at an y dose (Note: this includes a situation where the investigational product is not used as di rected at the dose prescribed b y the protocol). Overdose –Administration of a dose greater than the allocated dose of the study medication or at a frequency greater than the dosing interval specified by the protocol. Medication Error – An error made in pr escribing, dispensing, administration, and/or use of an investigational product. For studies, m edication errors are reportable to the sponsor only as defined below. Cases of subjects missing doses of the investigational product are not considered reportab le as medication errors. Medication errors should be collected/reported for all products under investigation. The administration and/or use of an expired investigational product should be considered as a reportable medication error.

Note: The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of ""serious"" refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. Requires inpatient ho spitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. Note: Hospitalizations, which are the result of elective or previousl y scheduled surgery for pre existing conditions, which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not be classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a previousl y scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from a hospitalization for an elective or previousl y scheduled surgery that meet(s) serious criteria must be reported as SAE(s).

In addition, any SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by the investigator at an y interval after the study has comp leted must be reported to the Shire Global Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Department within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. 8.2.5 Serious Adverse Event Onset and Resolution Dates The onset date of the SAE is defined as the date the event mee ts serious criteria. The resolution date is the date the event no longer meets serious criteria, the date the s ymptoms resolve, or the event is considered chronic. I n the case of hospitalizations, the hospital admission and discharge dates are considered t he onset and resolution dates, respectivel y. In addition, any signs or sy mptoms experienced by the subject after signing the informed consent form, or leading up to the onset date of the SAE, or following the resolution date of the SAE, must be recorded as an AE, if appropriate. 8.2.6 Fatal Outcome Any SAE that results in the subject’s death ( ie, the SAE was noted as the primary cause of death) must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution date. For all other events ongoi ng at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded. For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless another investigational product action was previously taken ( eg, drug interrupted, reduced, withdrawn), the action taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not changed” or “not applicable” (if the subject never received investigatio nal product). The investigational product action of “withdrawn” should not be selected solel y as a result of the subject’s death. For non-commercial use only"

All publications relating to Shire products or projects must undergo appropriate technical and intellectual propert y review, with Shire agreement to publish prior to release of information. The review is aimed at protecting the sponsor’s proprietary information existing either at the commencement of the study or generated during the study . To the extent permitted by the publisher and cop yright law, the principal investigator will own (or share with other authors) the copy right on his/her publications. To the extent that the principal investigator has such sole, joint or shared rights, the principal investigator grants the sponsor a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to make and distribute copies of such publications. The term “publication” refers to an y public disclosure including original research articles, review articles, oral presentations, abstracts and post ers at medical congresses, journal supplements, letters to the editor, invited lectures, opinion pieces, book chapters, electronic postings on medical/scientific websites, or other disclosure of the study results, in printed, electronic, oral or other form . Subject to the terms of the paragraph below, the investigator shall have the right to publish the study results, and any background information provided by the sponsor that is necessary to include in any publication of study results, or necessary for oth er scholars to verify such study results. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no publication that incorporates the sponsor’s For non-commercial use only"

If requested in writing by Shire, the institution and principal investigator shall withhold submission of such publication for up to an additional 60 day s to allow for filing of a patent application. If the stud y is part of a multicenter study, the first publication of the study results shall be made by the sponsor in conjunction with the sponsor’s presentation of a joint, multicenter publication of the compiled and analy zed st udy results. If such a multicenter publication is not submitted to a journal for publication by the sponsor within an 18-month period after conclusion, abandonment, or termination of the study at all sites, or after the sponsor confirms there shall be no m ulticenter study publication of the study results, an investigator may individuall y publish the study results from the specific site in accordance with this section. The investigator must, however, acknowledge in the publication the limitations of the sing le-site data being presented. Unless otherwise required by the journal in which the publication appears, or the forum in which it is made, authorship will comply with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors current standards.

Please consider the following clinical parameters identified as markers for adequate management of pediatric SBS. These parameters should also be considered for managing nutritional support (PS and/or oral/enteral feeding) in terms of volume and calories during the treatment period. Growth trajectory , including weight, height (or length), and head circumference (for pediatric subjects up to 36 months of age) Other clinical evaluations Serum electrol ytes Blood urea nitrogen /creatinine levels Changes in stool frequency orvolume, including mixed output Stool consistency (ie, Bristol Stool Scale) Urine specific gravit y General consideration to possible clinical deterioration in SBS Inability to maintain weight and growth velocity Diarrhea ( ≥10 bowel movements per day , ≥80 mL/kg/day from an ostomy, or ≥75mL/kg/day mixed output) Colic/vomiting frequency increased Electrol yte changes or imbalance Skin breakdown Adjustments should be based on the actual nutritional support in volume and calories the subject infuses. Subjects should remain compliant with the nutritional support prescription in volume and calories during the stud y. Nutritional support constituents may be adjusted at the discretion of the investigator. During the 48 -hour output measurement period prior to the subject’s scheduled visit, no further changes to the prescribed nutritional support should be made. If there is a change in enteral nutrition ( EN) or other food or fluid intake, the investigator should consider this when adjusting the PS/EN support in volume and calories.

Investigator(s): Multicenter study Site(s) and Region(s): Approximately 28 investigational sites in North America and Europe w ill participate in this extension study Study period (planned): October 2016 –September 2019Clinical phase: 3 Extension Objectives: Prim ary: To evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects w ith SBS. Secondary: To evaluate long -term efficacy of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects with SBS. Rationale: This is a Phase 3, prospective, open -label, long -term extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of teduglutide in pediatric subjects with short bow el syndrome (SBS) w ho completed the TED -C14-006 study (the core study). In addition to evaluating t he long -term safety and durability of efficacy after 24 -weeks of treatment, this extension study will evaluate the need for additional teduglutide treatment in these subjects, and w ill allow the study of first -time treatment of teduglutide -naïve subjects w ho participated in the standard of care (SOC) treatment arm in TED -C14-006. Investigational product, dose, and m ode of administration: This study will allow repeat doses of teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) once daily (QD) injection for eligible p ediatric subjects. There is no active comparator or reference product. Methodology: This is a Phase 3, prospective, open -label, long-term extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of teduglutide in pediatric subjects who completed the TED -C14-006 study (core study). Once the informed consent (and if applicable, informed assent) have been reviewed and signed , dem ographics, and updates to medical history and short bow el syndrome history will be obtained .Subjects not receiving teduglutide treatment ( ie, in a no -teduglutide treatment [NTT] perio d), w ill be seen approximately every 12 weeks for safety, parenteral support (PS) requirements, and quality of life. The first NTT visit after the screening visit will occur within 2 to 12 w eeks of the screening visit . At any point after screening, including during a NTT period, subjects who meet ≥1 teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria , may proceed immediately to the pre-treatment visit if the investigator, subj ect, and parent agree to proc eed with teduglutide therapy . After the pre -treatment visit, subjects who meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria, and meet none of the teduglutide treatment exclusion criteria, will start a 28 -week cycle, consisting of 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment at 0.05 mg/kg SC once daily, followed by a 4 -week follow -up period (during which no teduglutide is administered) (Figure 3 -1). During the 28 -week cycle, clinic visits will occur at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16 , 20, 24, and 28. Phone visits are required approximately 1 w eek after adjustments in PS during the teduglutide treatment period (betw een weeks 1 and 24), and w eekly during the teduglutide follow -up period (between weeks 24 and 28).Safety and PS requireme nts will be evaluated at every visit, and quality of life assessments will be m ade For non-commercial use only"

If a subject has clinical deterioration and meets follow -up period escape criteria after stopping teduglutide, the subject may ""escape"" the fol low-up period early and proceed immediately to another pre -treatment visit. Follow ing completion of the 28 -week treatment cycle, the subject w ill proceed to an NTT visit within approximately 12 w eeks. Atallsitevisits andtelephone contacts, safety willbemonitored andnutritional support willbereviewed and adjusted asneeded. Tomaintain consistency across centers, allattempts should bemade tofollow thenutritional support adjustment guidelines (developed withSBS expert input andprovided intheprotocol) fordecisions regarding PSsupport reduction andadvances inenteral feeds based onweightgain, urine andstool output, and clinical stability. Departure from theguidelines, however, isnotconsidered aprotocol deviation. (Appendix 2). Study Design Flow Chart Figure legend: Safety and efficacy data for subjects not receiving teduglutide treatment are captured approximately every 12 weeks, but subjects may proceed to the pre -treatment visit at any time in order to assess eligibility for teduglutide therapy. Eligible subjects will enter a 28 -week teduglutide cycle. During this cycle, subjects will return to the site for safety and efficacy assessments at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, and 24 ( solid black lines ). Phone visits are requ ired approximately 1 week after adjustments in PS during the intervening weeks between weeks 2 and 24 ( dashed grey lines ). Subjects discontinue teduglutide at week 24 and enter a 4 -week follow -up (no-treatment) period, during which phone visits will be per formed weekly ( solid grey lines ). If an escape criterion is met during the follow -up period, subjects may proceed directly to another pre -treatment visit.

179,page_179,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 23 SHP633 -304 Protocol Am endment 2 Teduglutide 23 Mar 2017 1BACKGROUND INFORMATION 1.1 Indication and Current Treatment Options Short bowel sy ndrome (SBS) is a rare disorder resulting from congenital abnormalities or severe intestinal diseases that result in major surgical resections of the small intestine. I t is estimated that, at most, there are a few hundred pediatric subjects 1 y ear and older with SBS (Khan et al., 2015; Wales et al., 2004 ) .Unlike the adult population, the majority of cases of SBS in pediatric subjects are due to congenital anomalies or catastrophic events that occur during infancy . Although t he small intestine is capable of remarkable adaptation, excessive loss of absorptive surface area or specialized functions can lead to dependence on parenteral nutrition or intravenous (IV) fluids (parenteral support [PS]). Treatment of both pediatric and adult patients is focused on achieving adequate intestinal absorption to allow for minimization or discontinuation of PS. About 30% of infants with SBS become independent of PS requirements within12months of the initial insult , and an additional 10% wean off PS within 24 months. After this time, linear intestinal growth slows. About 60% of pediatric subjects with SBS are able to become independent of PS within 5 y ears of the initial diagnosis (Khan et al., 2015). Nevertheless, despite optimal medica l management, many pediatric subjects remain dependent on PS. Complications of long -term PS include liver disease, catheter -related blood stream infections, central line- associated venous thrombosis and dwindling central venous access. Sepsis is the leadin g cause of death in these patients and quality of life is poor (Squires et al., 2012). Accelerating the adaptive process and achieving enteral autonomy is an urgent goal for all patients with SBS who are dependent on PS (Khan et al., 2015 ;Squires et al., 2012 ). Intestinal adaptation is driven by hormonal cues in response to nutrient malabsorption (Drucker and Yusta, 2014 ).Chief among these is hormones glucagon -like peptide 2 (GL P-2), which is secreted from L -type enteroendocrine cells that reside in the intestinal epithelium in the ileum and colon. Re section of these regions may impair the adaptive response b y limiting endogenous production of GLP -2. 1.2 Product Background Teduglutide is a novel, re combinant analog of naturally occurring human GLP -2 that regulates the functional and structural integrity of the cells lining the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Teduglutide is a 33 -amino acid peptide that differs from native GLP- 2 in the substitution of glycine for alanine at the second position at the N -terminus. As a result, teduglutide demonstrates resistance to degradation by dipeptidy l peptidase- IV (DPP -4) and therefore maintains a longer elimination half -life (t 1/2) in adults of approximately 2 hours c ompared to the native peptide, which has a t 1/2 of approximately 7 minutes. Teduglutide has been shown in animal studies and previous human clinical trials to increase villus height and cry pt depth in the intestinal epithelium, thereb y increasing the absor ptive surface area of the intestines ( Tappenden et al., 2013; Thymann et al., 2014 ). The European Commission granted a centralized marketing authorization valid throughout the European Union (EU) for teduglutide (Revestive™) on 30 August 2012 and a New Drug Application (NDA) for teduglutide (Gattex®) was approved b y the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 21 Decem ber2012 for the treatment of adult patients with SBS who are dependent on PS. Teduglutide has also been approved for use in adult patients with SBS in Canada and Switzerland. On 29 Jun 2016, the For non-commercial use only"

In this study , teduglutide was administered to 3 cohorts of pediatric subjects from age s 1-17. Thirty -seven pediatric subjects received teduglutide at doses of 0.0125, 0.025, or 0.05 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks. Five additional pediatric subjects were enrolled in an observational standard of care (SOC) cohort. There were clear dose -dependent effects of teduglutide seen at the 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day doses compared to SOC and the 0.0125 mg/kg/day dose. In the 0.025 mg/kg/day cohort there was a reduction in PS volume at Week 12 of 37%, including complete independence from PS support in 1 subject, and a reduction of 3.94 hours per day infusion time. I n the 0.05 mg/kg/day cohort there was a reduction in PS volume at Week 12 of 39%, including complete independence from PS support in 3 subjects, and a reduction of 4.18 hours per day infusion time. Teduglutide was generally safe and well tolerated by pediatric subjects in all dosing cohorts. There were no deaths during the study and no treatment -emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) related to teduglutide were reported. No discontinuations from study were due to adverse events (AEs). TED -C14-006 is an ongoing study which includes 2 treatment arms: a teduglutide treatment arm and a standard of care treatment arm. Subjects in both arms participate in a 2 -week minimum screening period, a 24 -week treatment period, and a 4- week follow -up period. During the screening period, subjects will choose into which arm to enroll. During the 24 -week treatment period, subjects in the SOC treatment arm will receive standard medical therap y for SBS; while those in the teduglutide treatment arm will receive daily subcutaneous (SC) injections of teduglut ide (stud y drug) in addition to standard medical therap y. The subjects enrolling in the teduglutide treatment arm will be randomized 1:1 in a double -blinded manner into 2 parallel dose groups: 0.025 mg/kg/day or 0.05 mg/kg/day of teduglutide administered subcutaneousl y for 24 weeks.

In addition to evaluating the long- term safet y and durability of efficacy after 24 weeks of treatment, this extension study will evaluate the need for additional teduglutide treatment in these subjects, and will allow for the first- time treatment of teduglutide -naïve subjects who participated in the SOC treatment arm in TED -C14-006. 2.2 Study Objectives 2.2.1 Primary Objectives The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long -term safet y and tolerability of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects with SBS who completed TED -C14-006. 2.2.2 Secondary Objectives The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the long -term efficacy of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects with SBS who completed TED -C14-006.

At the time of entry into the TED- C14-006 study , subjects wer e less than 18 y ears of age, were dependent on parenteral nutrition to provide at least 30% of their caloric or fluid needs, and had not been able to significantly reduce PS for at least 3 months prior to enrollment. During the core study , pediatric subjec ts in the teduglutide treatment arm were randomized to 0.025 mg/kg or 0.05 mg/kg once daily (QD) dosing in a double -blinded manner. The TED -C14-006 study will also be referred to as the core stud y interchangeably throughout this protocol. Approximately 34 subjects who complete the core study are expected to enroll in this extension study . Subjects who previously received teduglutide during TED -C14-006, as well as subjects who were in the SOC treatment group, may be eligible to receive teduglutide treatment in this extension study . To be eligible, subjects must meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria and none of the teduglutide treatment exclusion criteria. Additional Teduglutide Treatment Subjects not receiving teduglutide treatment ( ie, in a “no -teduglutide treatment period”), will be seen approximately every 12 weeks for safety , parenteral support (PS) requirements, and qualit y of life. At an y point during a no -teduglutide treatment period, subjects who meet ≥1 teduglutide treatment inclusi onmay proceed directl y to the pre -treatment visit if the investigator, subject, and parent agree to proceed with teduglutide therapy . Rationale: Some pediatric subjects may have a durable beneficial effect after 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment and thus long-term follow -up without additional teduglutide treatment may be appropriate. However, there may be some pediatric subjects who deteriorate or stop improving after discontinuation of teduglutide treatment. I n these pediatric subjects, additional teduglu tide treatment may be beneficial. Dose Selection Analy sis suggested that pediatric patients, ages 1 to 17 y ears old, are likel y to require the same dose as used in adults, namely 0.05 mg/kg/day (Mouksassi et al., 2009 ).In this extension study to TED -C14-006, repeat doses of teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg QD will be administered to eligible pediatric subjects who previously received teduglutide 0.05 or 0.025 mg/kg in Study TED -C14- 006. Rationale: Teduglutide is approved for adult use in the USand EU, and for pediatric use in the EU,at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg SC once daily . The completed 12 -week pediatric study (TED -C13- 003) demonstrated that teduglutide dosing at 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day was associated with a favorable benefit/risk profile. In addition, population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations were conducted to determine the effective dose to be used in pediatric sub jects using data from 8adult clinical studies including adult Phase 1 studies and Phases 2/3 studies as well as the pediatric stud y (TED -C13-003) and suggested that the dose in pediatric subjects is likely to be same as the dose in adults (O'Keefe et al., 2006 ).

183,page_183,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 27 SHP633 -304 Protocol Am endment 2 Teduglutide 23 Mar 2017 Duration of Treatment The duration of teduglutide treatment in this study mirrors that of the TED -C14-006 study , consisting of 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment, followed by a 4-week follow -up period. The follow -up period is a mechanism to evaluate whether continued teduglutide is needed. If a subject deteriorates during the follow -up period, the s ubject may be evaluated immediately for additional teduglutide treatment. Subjects who clinically deteriorate or stop improving at any time after the end of the follow- up period will also be assessed for additional treatment. Rationale: During the teduglut ide treatment cy cle, visit frequency is similar to frequencies performed in TED -C13-003 and TED -C14-006, to ensure sufficient safety monitoring and weaning of PS. During the no-teduglutide treatment, visits occur every 12 weeks, a frequency that is consist ent with standard medical practices. Measures and Parameters Following the review and signing of the informed consent (and informed assent, if applicable), screening visit procedures will begin including demographics, and updates to medical history and SBS history . Subjects who meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria may proceed to the pre -treatment visit. Afterthe pre -treatment visit, subjects who still meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria, and meet none of the teduglutide treatment exclusion criteria, will start a 28 -week cy cle, consisting of 24 weeks of teduglutide treatm ent at 0.05 mg/kg SC once daily , followed by a 4- week follow -up (no treatment) period ( Figure 3-1). During the 28 -week cycle, clinic visits wi ll occur at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28. Phone visits are required approximately 1 week after adjustments in PS during the teduglutide treatment period ( between weeks 1-24), and weekl y during the teduglutide follow -up period (between weeks 24 and 28 ). Safety and PS requirements will be evaluated on a weekl y basis, and quality of life assessments will be made approximately every 12 weeks. At all site visits and telephone contacts, safety will be monitored and nutritional support will be reviewed and adjusted as needed. To maintain consistency across centers, all attempts should be made to follow the nutritional support adjustment guidelines (developed with SBS expert input and provided in the protocol) for decisions regarding PS reduction and advances in enteral feeds based on weight gain, urine and stool output, and clinical stability . Departure from the guidelines, however, is not considered a protocol deviation ( Appendix 2 ). Rationale: Measures of long term safet y will include adverse events , growth parameters and anti - drug antibodies. Measure of long term efficacy will include durability of effect as measured b y reduction in PS and improvement in pediatric quality of life measures (PedsQL , PedsQL Family Impact Module). A reduction in PS volu me of at least 20% at end of treatment ( EOT) was used as the primary endpoint in pivotal phase 3 adult clinical trials and the completed phase 3 pediatric stud y (TED -C13-003), and will be used as an endpoint in this extension study . In previous clinical studies, a reduction of this magnitude was associated with a reduction in the number of day s per week of PS, and increases in enteral intake. Reduction in volume and time of PS due to improved enteral absorption may provide a pediatric subject with opportuni ties for more age -appropriate activities including oral rehabilitation. Quality of life assessments will be performed in this study to quantitate this effect. For non-commercial use only"
184,page_184,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 28 SHP633 -304Protocol Amendment 2 Teduglutide 23 Mar 2017 Teduglutide has been found to have a targeted intestinotrophic effect. Taking into account the patient population and the pharmacologic effect of teduglutide, GI -specific screening tests, including fecal occult blood testing and colonoscopy /sigmoidoscopy , which are commonl y part of the routine care of these subjects, will be performed to ensure safet y. This study captures long - term safet y data on polyps and other colonic mucosal changes in teduglutide -exposed subjects using the surveillance strategy proposed in Section 7.2.9 . Figure 3-1: Study Design Flow Chart Figure legend: Safety and efficacy data for subjects not receiving teduglutide treatment are captured approximately every 12weeks, but subjects may proceed to the pre -treatment visit at any time in order to assess eligibility for teduglutide therapy. Eligible subjects will enter a 28 -week teduglutide cycle. During this cycle, subjects will return to the site for safety and efficacy assessments at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, and 24 ( solid black lines ). Phone visits are required approximate ly 1 week after adjustments in PS during the intervening weeks between weeks 2 and 24 ( dashed grey lines ). Subjects discontinue teduglutide at week 24 and enter a 4 -week follow-up (no -treatment) period, during which phone visits will be performed weekly ( solid grey lines ). If an escape criterion is met during the follow -up period, subjects may proceed directly to another pre -treatment visit. 3.2 Duration and Study Completion Definition A subject will be considered enrolled in the stud y once the subject has provided signed consent, and meets all of the Inclusion Criteria. The study will continue for at least 1 y ear and until each subject has access, as needed, to teduglutide. The subject’s maximum duration of participation is expected to be approximately 3 years. The study will be completed in approximately 40 months. A subject will be considered as having completed the study if the subject has not withdrawn early from the stud y for any re ason prior to completing the End of Study (EOS) visit. The study completion date is defined as the date the final subject, across all sites, completes their final protocol -defined assessment.

At any time during the follow -up period, if escape criteria are met, the subject may proceed directly to another Pre -Treatment visit to assess treatment eligibility for another cy cle (Section 4.6). Following the completion of the 4- week follow -up, the subject will continue in the study off teduglutide. Additional 28 -week cy cles may be repeat ed if treatment eligibility is established each time. 6.2.4 Unblinding the Treatment Assignment Not applicable for this open -label stud y. 6.3 Labeling, Packaging, Storage, and Handling 6.3.1 Labeling Labels containing study information and pack identification will be ap plied to the investigational product(s) container. The study drug will be packaged, labeled, and shipped to the study site by the sponsor or designee. Kits containing 7 vials of study drug will be supplied and these will be labeled in accordance with appl icable regulatory requirements. Sterile water for injection sy ringes and other ancillary components will be provided separately and will be labeled in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements. All study drug used in this study will be manufactured, tested, labeled, and released according to current legal requirements and Good Manufacturing Practice. 6.3.2 Packaging Investigational product is packaged in the following conditions: Teduglutide will be provided in a sterile, single -use, glass vial as a ly ophilized powder, to be reconstituted with 0.5 mL sterile water for injection provided as the diluent in a prefilled s yringe. Changes to sponsor -supplied packaging prior to dosing may not occur without full agreement in advance b y the sponsor. 6.3.3 Storage and Handling The investigator has overall responsibility for ensuring that investigational product is stored in a secure, limited -access location. L imited responsibility may be delegated to the pharmacy or member of the stud y team, but this delegation must b e documented. For non-commercial use only"

Study drug will be stored refrigerated at a temperature between 2 to 8°C (35.6 to 46.4°F) until dispensed to a subject. Once dispensed to a subject, the study drug can be stored refrigerated or up to a controlled room temperature (acceptable range of 2 to 25°C, or 35.6 to 77°F). Parent/guardian will be instructed to keep the subject’s stud y drug and sterile water diluent at controlled room temperature. If there are concerns that the controlled room temperature cannot be maintained, the stud y drug may be refrigerated. The study drug is for single use only , and should be used within 3 hours following reconstitution. Investigational product must be stored in accordance with labeled storage conditions. Temperature monitoring is required at the storage location to ensure that the investigational product is maintained within an established temperature range. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that th e temperature is monitored throughout the duration of the study and that records are maintained; the temperature should be monitored continuously by using either an in-house sy stem, a mechanical recording device such as a calibrated chart recorder, or by manual means, such that both minimum and maximum thermometric values over a specific time period can be recorded and retrieved as required. Such a device ( ie, certified min/max thermometer) would require manual resetting upon each recording. The sponsor mus t be notified immediately upon discovery of any excursion from the established range. Temperature excursions will require site investigation as to cause and remediation. The sponsor will determine the ultimate impact of excursions on the investigational pr oduct and will provide supportive documentation as necessary . Under no circumstances should the product be dispensed to subjects until the impact has been determined and the product is deemed appropriate for use b y the sponsor. The sponsor should be notifi ed immediately if there are an y changes to the storage area of the investigational product that could affect the integrity of the product(s), eg, fumigation of a storage room. Investigational products are distributed b y the pharmacy or nominated member of the study team. The pharmacist/nominated team member will enter the unique subject identifier on the investigational product bottle/carton labels, as they are distributed. 6.4 Drug Accountability Investigators will be provided with sufficient amounts of the investigational product to carry out this protocol for the agreed number of subjects. The investigator or designee will acknowledge receipt of the investigational product, documenting shipment content and condition. The investigator is to keep a current re cord of the inventory and dispensation of all clinical supplies. This record will be made available to the sponsor’s site monitor for the purpose of accounting for all clinical supplies. Any discrepancy or deficiency will be recorded and will include an explanation. All supplies sent to the investigator must be accounted for and in no case will clinical supplies be used in any unauthorized situation. The investigator has overall responsibility for administering/dispensing investigational product. Where perm issible, tasks may be delegated to a qualified designee ( eg, a pharmacist) who is adequatel y trained in the protocol and who works under the direct supervision of the investigator. This delegation must be documented in the applicable study delegation of authority form. The investigator or his/her designee (as documented by the investigator in the applicable study delegation of authorit y form) will dispense the investigational product only to subjects eligible For non-commercial use only"

Note: The amount of blood to be drawn for each assessment is an estimate. The amount of blood to be drawn may vary according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer or laboratory for an individual assessment. When more than 1 blood assessment is to be done at the time point/period, if they require the same t ype of tube, the assessments should be combined. Blood volume estimates do not include safet y labs performed after PS adjustment, and anti -teduglutide antibody testing during no- teduglutide treatment. 7.2.9 Gastrointestinal- specific Testing 7.2.9.1 Fecal Occult Blood Testing Fecal occult blood testing must be performed on all subjects at the pre-treatment visit, week 12, and week 24 of the teduglutide cy cle. During NTT periods, FOBT must be performed on teduglutide -exposed subjects (subjects who have received teduglutide an y time in the past and are therefore not teduglutide -naïve) on a roughl y annual basis (approxima tely every 48-60 weeks). Actions to be taken in response to a positive FOBT are described below. 7.2.9.2 Colonoscopy or Sigmoidoscopy Teduglutide -naïve subjects age 12 and older will undergo colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy at the pre-treatment visit if one has not be en performed within 1 y ear. Subjects of an y age with newly positive FOBT results at the pre -treatment visit for which a readil y detectable cause cannot be identified ( eg, anal fissure) will undergo a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscop y prior to receiving teduglu tide. If newly positive FOBT results (for which a readil y detectable cause cannot be identified) are obtained at the end of a teduglutide treatment cycle (CxW24/EOT), colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy will be performed. The need for colonoscop yor sigmoidoscopy in response to positive FOBTs at any other point during the study , or to re -evaluate persistently positive FOBTs is at the discretion of the investigator. Teduglutide -exposed subjects who have received the equivalent of 2 treatment cy cles (48 weeks of study drug exposure) will undergo colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy . While receiving additional teduglutide treatment, subjects will undergo colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy at 5 y ear intervals or more often as needed. Upper endoscopy may be performed along with any colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy at the investigator’s discretion. If a pol yp is found, adherence to current pol yp follow -up guidelines is recommended. Subjects with unresected GI pol yps, poly posis conditions, pre - malignant change or malignancy in the GI trac t will be excluded from teduglutide treatment. 7.2.10 Nutritional Support Nutritional support includes PS, enteral nutrition , and other food and fluids.

This diary should be completed b y the su bject (or parent/ legal guardian , as applicable) dail y during the teduglutide treatment period (between visits CxD1 and CxW24). 7.2.11.2 Intake Diary Intake diaries will be used to collect and evaluate each subject’s nutritional support. The subject/parent/guardian will complete the appropriate fields of the PS section of the intake diary 2 weeks prior to ALL scheduled site visits (except at pre-treatment visit) . During the 24-week teduglutide treatment period, the intake diary will also be completed for 1 week follo wing PS adjustments. The intake diary will also be completed daily during the 4 -week follow -up period. The following data will be captured in the intake diaries: Parenteral support volume and infusion duration Site personnel will determine the actual PS da ily calories based on diary entries. All available diary data will be reviewed by the investigator or their designee at each clinic and telephone visit to assess clinical status and opportunity for PS reduction and advance in feeds. 7.2.11.3 Output Diary Urine and stool output should be recorded in the output diary over a 48-hour period of nutritional stability before every clinic visit; in addition, output should be recorded for subjects that are in a teduglutide treatment cy cle within 1 week of implementing a chan ge in the PS prescription, regardless of previous teduglutide exposure. Urine data: Toilet -trained subjects (who do not wear diapers) Measure and record all urine output in mL or cc Nontoilet- trained subjects (who wear diapers) Measure and record the weight of all urine -only diapers. Urine volume will be calculated using the following formula: 1 g (scale weight) = 1 mL or 1 cc At the discretion of the investigator, the parent may be asked to collect the first void after the daily PS infusion to measure specific gravity Stool data (includes diapers with mixed urine and stool): Toilet -trained subjects (who do not wear diapers) Record the occurrence of each bowel movement and score the stool consistency using the Bristol Stool Form Scale (see Output diary ) For non-commercial use only"

Each PedsQL age- appropriate form takes less than 4 minutes to complete. The scales include self- reports for pediatric subjects and adolescents aged 5 to 18years and prox y-reports from parents of pediatric subjects aged 2 to 18 years. Field trials have shown that the internal consistency reliability of the PedsQL was excellent, with alphas for the generic core scales in both self -and proxy -report greater than the 0.70 standard, and alphas for the full 23 -item scale approaching 0.90 for self -and prox y-report. Missing data were minimal. Item response distributions were across the full scale range, with no floor effects, and minimal ceiling effects. The validity of the PedsQL Generic Core Scales was demonstrated through known group comparisons, and correlations with other measures of disease burden. The PedsQL self-and proxy-report distinguished between pediatric subjects with and without a chronic health condition, and within the group of pediatric subjects with a chronic condition, between those who did or did not have an overnight hospital visit in the last 12 months. Further, both child self - report and parent prox y-report correlated significantly with the number of days the child was too ill to pursue normal activities, needed some one to care for him or her, missed school in the last month, the number of day s the parent missed from work in the last month, and parent -report of problems pursuing their normal work routine and concentrating at work. The PedsQL Generic Core Scales are al so responsive to clinical change, as demonstrated in field trials. 7.2.12.1 Pediatric Quality of Life Generic Core Scale (PedsQL™), Acute version The PedsQL Generic Core Scale is designed to measures health -related quality of life (HRQoL) in pediatric subjects and adolescents (2 -18 years of age). The developmentally appropriate PedsQL Generic Core Scale will be completed by either the parent or legal guardian and subject as indicated in Table 7 -3at the time points as outlined inTable 1-1, Table 1 -2,and Table 1 -3.

The Child and Parent Reports of the PedsQL Generic Core Scale for Young Pediatric subjects (ages 5 -7), Pediatric subjects (ages 8- 12), and Teens (ages 13 -18) are composed of 23 items comprising 4 dimensions as follows: 1) Physical Functioning (8 items), 2) Emo tional Functioning (5 items), 3) Social Functioning (5 items), 4) School Functioning (5 items). 7.2.12.2 Pediatric Quality of Life Family Impact Module (PedsQL™), Acute version The PedsQL Family Impact Module is a parent -report multidimensional instrument that will be completed b y the parent or legal guardian, as outlined in Table 1-1, Table 1 -2, and Table 1 - 3. The PedsQL Family Impact Module is a specific module of the PedsQL th at is used to measure the impact of pediatric chronic health conditions on parents and the family (Varni et al., 2004 ). The 36- item PedsQL Family Impact Module consists of 6 scales measuring parent self -reported functioning as follows: 1) Physical Functioning (6 items), 2) Emot ional Functioning (5 items), 3)Social Functioning (4 items), 4) Cognitive Functioning (5 items; worries about treatment and disease), 5) Communication (3 items), 6) Worry (5items). Two additional scales measure parent - reported family functioning as follows: 1) Dail y Activities (3 items), and 2) Family Relationships (5 items). The PedsQL Family Impact Module should take the parent or legal guardian approximately 5 to 10 minutes to complete. 7.2.12.3 PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module (PedsQL™), Acute version The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Sy mptom Module is a disease -specific 58- item module, comprised of 10 differe ntsymptom scales that assess gastrointestinal sy mptom -related quality of life: food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in poop, and diarrhea.

An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (ICH Guidance E2A 1995). All AEs are collected from the time the informed consent is signed until the defined follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.4 . This includes events occurring during the screening phase of the study , regardless of whether or not investigational product is administered. Where possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of sy mptoms should be recorded. If a diagnosis has not been made, then each s ymptom should be listed individually . All AEs should be captured on the appropriate AE pages in the eCRF and in source documents. In addition to untoward AEs, unexpected benefits outside the investigational product indication should also be captured on the AE eCRF. All AEs must be followed to clo sure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline status or all variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the study . Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved (the i nvestigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event), or the event is otherwise explained. When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of event(s) can be documented. 8.1.1 Severity Categorization The severit y of AEs must be recorded during the course of the event including the start and stop dates for each change in severit y. An event that changes in severity should be captured as a new event. Worsening of pre -treatment events, after initiation of investigational product, must be recorded as new AEs (for example, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dy spepsia prior to dosing of investigational product, but the dy spepsia becomes severe and more frequent after first dose of investigational product has been administered, a new AE of severe dy spepsia [with the appropriate date of onset] is recorded on the appropriate eCRF). The medical assessment of severit y is determined by using the following definitions: Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living. Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention. The event interfer es with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject. Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantl y affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. For non-commercial use only"
209,page_209,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 53 SHP633 -304 Protocol Am endment 2 Teduglutide 23 Mar 2017 In consideration of whether a treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) might lead to dose interruption (Section 8.4.1) or early termination of the study (Section 8.5), severe TEAEs will also be graded according to the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) severit y grading criteria (US Department of Health and Human Services et al., 2010 ). 8.1.2 Relationship Cate gorization A phy sician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caus ed by the investigational product. If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related”. Otherwise, if there is an y valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a possible cause -and- effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related”. The causality assessment must be documented in the source document. The following additional guidance may be helpful: Term Relationship Definition RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or suspected response pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained by the subject’s medical condition, other therapies, or accident. Not RelatedThe event can be readil y explained by other factors such as the subject’s underl ying medical condition, concomitant therapy , or accident and no plausible temporal or biologic relations hip exists between the investigational product and the event. AEs that are related to study drug that are not resolved at EOT will be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes, as judged b y the investigator. Laboratory values, vital signs, and clinical findings at the scheduled ph ysical examinations must be reported as AEs if the investigator considers the finding to be a clinicall y significant change from the baseline. 8.1.3 Outcome Categorization The outcome of AEs must be recorded during the cours e of the stud y in the eCRF. Outcomes are as follows: Fatal Not Recovered/Not Resolved Recovered/Resolved Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae For non-commercial use only"
210,page_210,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 54 SHP633 -304 Protocol Am endment 2 Teduglutide 23 Mar 2017 Recovering/Resolving Unknown 8.1.4 Symptoms of the Disease under Study Symptoms of the disease under study should not be classed as AEs as long as they are within the normal day -to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease and are part of the efficacy data to be collected in the study; however, significant worsening of the s ymptoms should be recorded as an AE. 8.1.5 Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Evaluations A change in the value of a clinical laboratory or vital sign can represent an AE if the change is clinically relevant or if, during the study , a shift of a parameter is observed from a normal value to an abnormal value, or a further worsening of an already abnormal value. When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the reference range, the duration until return to the reference range, either while continuing treatment or after the end of treatme nt with the investigational product, and the range of variation of the respective parameter within its reference range, must be taken into consideration. If, during the study, there are abnormal clinical laboratory values or vital signs which were not present at the beginning of the study , further investigations should be performed until the values return to within the reference range or until a plausible explanation ( eg, concomitant disease) is found for the abnormal values. The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory or vital sign is clinicall y significant and therefore represents an AE. 8.1.6 Pregnancy All pregnancies are to be reported from the time informed consent is signed until the defined follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.4. Any report of pregnancy for any female study participant must be reported within 24 hours to the Shire Global Drug Safet y Department using the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form. A copy of the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form (and an y applicable follow -up reports) must also be sent to the Shire Medical Monitor using the details specified in the emergency contact information section of the protocol. In the event a subject becomes pregnant during the study , teduglutide administration must be discontinued immediately. Every effort should be made to gather informat ion regarding the pregnancy outcome and condition of the infant. It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain this information within 30 calendar day s after the initial notification and approximately 30 calendar day s post partum. Pregnancy compl ications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clinical Study Adverse Event Form for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Non- serious AEs as Required b y the Protocol. Note: An elective abortion is not considered an SAE. For non-commercial use only"
211,page_211,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 55 SHP633 -304 Protocol Am endment 2 Teduglutide 23 Mar 2017 In addition to the above, if the investigator determines that the pregnancy meets serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE using the Shire Clinical Study Adverse Event Form for SAEs and Non-serious AEs as Required by the Protocol as well as the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form. The test date of the first positive serum/urine -HCG test or will determine the pregnancy onset date. 8.1.7 Abuse, Misuse, Overdose, and Medication Error Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error (as defined below) must be reported to the sponsor according to the SAE reporting procedure whether or not they result in an AE/SAE as described in Section 8.2. Note: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAE s does not apply to reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless these result in an SAE. The categories below are not mutually exclusive; the event can meet more than 1 category . Abuse – Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of inve stigational product when used for a non -medical purpose ( eg, to alter one’s state of consciousness or get high) in a manner that may be detrimental to the individual and/or society . Misuse –Intentional use of investigational product other than as directed or indicated at any dose (Note: this includes a situation where the investigational product is not used as directed at the dose prescribed by the protocol). Overdose –Administration of a dose greater than the allocated dose of the study medication or at a frequency greater than the dosing interval specified by the protocol. Medication Error –An error made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and/or use of an investigational product. For studies, medication errors are reportable to the sponsor only as defined below. Cases of subjects missing doses of the investigational product are not considered reportable as medication errors. Medication errors should be collected/reported for all products under investigation. The administration and/or use of an expired investigational product should be considered as a reportable medication error. All investigational product provided to pediatric subjects should be supervised by the parent/legall y-authorized representative/caregiver. 8.2 Serious Adverse Event Procedures 8.2.1 Reference Safety Information The reference for safet y information for this study is the investigator brochure which the sponsor has provided under separate cover to all investigators. 8.2.2 Reporting Procedures All initial and follow -up SAE reports must be reported by the investigator to the Shire Global Drug Safet y Department andthe Shire Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of For non-commercial use only"

All Adverse Events of Special Interest , as defined in Section 8.3, must be reported by the investigator to the Shire Global Drug Safet y Department and the Shire Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event even if the event does not fulfill seriousness criterion. The investigator must complete, sign, and date the Shire Clinica l Study Adverse Event Form for SAEs and Non- serious AEs as Required b y Protocol, and verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the form with the corresponding source documents (Note: Source documents are not to be sent unless requested). Fax or e -mail the completed form to the Shire Global Drug Safet y Department. A cop y of the completed Shire Clinical Study Adverse Event Form for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Non -serious AEs as Required b y Protocol (and any applicable follow -up reports) must al so be sent to the Shire medical monitor or designee using the details specified in the emergency contact information section of the protocol. 8.2.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition ASAE is any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to inv estigational product or not) that at any dose: Results in death Is life -threatening. Note: The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of ""serious"" refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. Note: Hospitalizations, which are the result of elective or previousl y scheduled surgery for pre existing conditions, which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not be classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a previousl y scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from a hospitalization for an elective or previousl y scheduled surgery that meet(s) serious criteria must be reported as SAE(s). Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity Is a congenital abnormality /birth defect Is an important medical eve nt. Note: I mportant medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient h ospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

In addition, any SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered b y the investigator at an y interval after the study has completed must be reported to the Shire Global Drug Safet y Department within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. 8.2.5 Serious Adverse Event Onset and Resolution Dates The onset dat e of the SAE is defined as the date the event meets serious criteria. The resolution date is the date the event no longer meets serious criteria, the date the s ymptoms resolve, or the event is considered chronic. I n the case of hospitalizations, the hospit al admission and discharge dates are considered the onset and resolution dates, respectivel y. In addition, any signs or sy mptoms experienced by the subject after signing the informed consent form, or leading up to the onset date of the SAE, or following th e resolution date of the SAE, must be recorded as an AE, if appropriate. 8.2.6 Fatal Outcome Any SAE that results in the subject’s death ( ie, the SAE was noted as the primary cause of death) must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded a s the resolution date. For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded. For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or a ny ongoing events at the time of death, unless another investigational product action was previously taken ( eg, drug interrupted, reduced, withdrawn), the action taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not changed” or “not applic able” (if the subject never received investigational product). The investigational product action of “withdrawn” should not be selected solel y as a result of the subject’s death. 8.2.7 Regulatory Agency, Institutional Review Board, Ethics Committee, and Site Reporting The Sponsor and/or Clinical Contract Research Organization ( CRO )is responsible for notify ing the relevant regulatory authorities, and US central Institutional Review Boards ( IRBs)/EU central ethics committees ( ECs), of related, unexpected SAEs. In addition, the Clinical CRO is responsible for notify ing active sites of all related, unexpected SAEs occurring during all interventional studies across the SHP633 program. The investigator is responsible for notifying the local IRB, local EC, or the rel evant local regulatory authorit y of all SAEs that occur at his or her site as required. 8.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest An AE of special interest is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or pro gram and for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the investigator to the sponsor is required.

Attempts should be made to contact the sponsor/designee prior to dose interruption. Reasons for dosage interruptions may include but are not limited to hospitalization ,AEs, a lapse in investigational product delivery , etc. Study drug must be discontinued if any of the following events occur: Pregnancy Severe h ypersensitivity , such as anaph ylaxis determined by the investigator to be related to study drug. This does not include the presence of anti -teduglutide antibodies, mild injection site reactions or mild sy mptoms that according to the investigator do not pose a significant risk to the subject. An AE that is of NCI CTCAE severit y Grade 3 or 4 and considered to be related to stu dy drug administration Confirmed drug -induced liver injury (DILI) related to teduglutide ( see Section 8.4.2) 8.4.1 Dose Interruption Criteria Based on Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Investigational Product The investigational product must be discontinued if the subject experienced an AE that is of severit y ≥Grade 3 per the NCI CTCAE and is reported as related to the investigational product . In consideration of whether a TEAE might lead to dose interruption, severe TEAEs will also be graded ac cording to the NCI CTCAE severit y grading criteria (US Department of Health and Human Services et al., 2010 ) .All such TEAEs s hould be discussed with the Shire M edical Monitor or designee as soon as possible.

International normalized ratio should be m easured with this set of verification laboratory assessments and an inquiry should be made as to the presence of clinical s ymptoms consistent with new liver injury . The subject should be followed closely to determine the trajectory of the laboratory abnorm alities and to evaluate the cause of liver injury . This evaluation may include, as clinically indicated, consideration of sepsis, acute viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A immunoglobulin [IgM], hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibodies, cy tomegalovi rus IgM, Epstein- Barr virus antibody panel), hepatobiliary obstruction (ultrasound), autoimmune hepatitis (anti-nuclear, anti -smooth muscle, anti -actin, or anti -liver kidney microsomal antibodies), intestinal failure associated liver disease, cardiovascula r causes such as ischemic hepatitis, and concomitant hepatotoxic treatments. Additional evaluations may be performed at the discretion of the investigator in consultation with the Shire medical monitor. Teduglutide administration must be permanentl y discontinued if DILI is confirmed and deemed related to stud y drug. 8.5 Early Termination of the Clinical Study The DMC may recommend stopping the study ifany of the following conditions are met : ≥2subjects develop the same event of CTCAE severity Grade 3 that is reported asrelated to the investigational product or 1 subject develops an event of CTCAE severity Grade 4 that is reported asrelated to the investigational product.

A study monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and review the eCRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy . Discrepancies betwee n source data and data entered in the eCRF will be addressed b y qualified site personnel. When a data discrepancy warrants correction, the correction will be made by authorized site personnel. Data collection procedures will be discussed with the site at t he site initiation visit and/or at the investigator’s meeting. Unscheduled safet y follow up assessments ( including visits conducted after EOS) are not to be collected unless requested . 9.2 Clinical Data Management Data are to be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRO’s data management process. Quality control and data validation procedures are applied to ensure the validity and accuracy of the clinical database. Data are to be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requiring f urther clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring clarification are to be communicated to the site for resolution. Only authorized personnel will make corrections to the clinical database, and all corrections are documen ted in an auditable manner. 9.3 Statistical Analysis Process The study will be anal yzed by the sponsor or its agent. All statistical anal yses will be performed using SAS®(SAS Institute, Cary , NC, USA) version 9.3 or higher. The statistical anal ysis plan (SAP ) will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the analysis of the efficacy and safet y data, as well as describe the approaches to be taken for summarizing other study information such as subject disposition, demographics and baseline character istics, investigational product exposure, and prior and concomitant medications. 9.4 Planned Interim Analysis, and Data Monitoring Committee An interim anal ysis is planned when 6 months of safet y data have been collected. A DMC will be involved in the manag ement of this study . The DMC members will review the data approximately every 3 months according to the DMC Charter . The DMC review will include all cumulative safety data ( ie, AEs, laboratory assessments, phy sical examinations, etc.) from study assessment s through each cutoff period. Further details regarding the DMC can be found in the DMC charter, which will be available prior to the administration of investigational product. The DMC for this study will be conducted in accordance with the FDA Guidance f or Clinical Trial Sponsors: Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees (March 2006).

Additionally , Shire adheres to external guidelines (eg, Good Publication Practices 2) when forming a publication steering committee, which is done for large, multicenter Phase 2 -4 and certain other studies as determined b y Shire. The purpose of the publication steering committee is to act as a non- commerc ial body that advises or decides on dissemination of scientific study data in accordance with the scope of this policy . All publications relating to Shire products or projects must undergo appropriate technical and intellectual propert y review, with Shire agreement to publish prior to release of information. The review is aimed at protecting the sponsor’s proprietary information existing either at the commencement of the study or generated during the study . To the extent permitted by the publisher and cop yright law, the principal investigator will own (or share with other authors) the copy right on his/her publications. To the extent that the principal investigator has such sole, joint or shared rights, the principal investigator grants the sponsor a perpetua l, irrevocable, royalty-free license to make and distribute copies of such publications. The term “publication” refers to an y public disclosure including original research articles, review articles, oral presentations, abstracts and posters at medical cong resses, journal supplements, letters to the editor, invited lectures, opinion pieces, book chapters, electronic postings on medical/scientific websites, or other disclosure of the study results, in printed, electronic, oral or other form. Subject to the te rms of the paragraph below, the investigator shall have the right to publish the study results, and any background information provided by the sponsor that is necessary to include in an y publication of study results, or necessary for other scholars to veri fy such study results. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no publication that incorporates the sponsor’s confidential information shall be submitted for publication without the sponsor’s prior written agreement to publish, and shall be given to the sponsor for review at least 60 day s prior to submission for publication. If requested in writing by Shire, the institution and principal investigator shall withhold submission of such publication for up to an additional 60 day s to allow for filing of a patent applica tion. If the stud y is part of a multicenter study, the first publication of the study results shall be made by the sponsor in conjunction with the sponsor’s presentation of a joint, multicenter publication of the compiled and analy zed study results. If suc h a multicenter publication is not submitted to a journal for publication by the sponsor within an 18-month period after conclusion, abandonment, or termination of the study at all sites, or after the sponsor confirms there shall be no multicenter study publication of the study results, an investigator may individuall y publish the study results from the specific site in accordance with this section. The investigator must, however, acknowledge in the publication the limitations of the single -site data being presented.

This study will enroll up to as many subjects as complete the TED -C14-006 and SHP633 -301 studies. Investigator(s): Multicenter study Site(s) and Region(s): Approximately 28 investigational sites in North America and Europe w ill participate in this extension study Study period (planned): October 2016 –September 2019Clinical phase: 3 Extension Objectives: Prim ary: To evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects w ith SBS. Secondary: To evaluate long -term efficacy of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects with SBS. Rationale: This is a Phase 3, prospective, open -label, long -term extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of teduglutide in pediatric subjects with short bow el syndrome (SBS) w ho completed either the TED -C14-006 or SHP633 -301 studies (the core studies). In addition to evaluating the long -term safety and durability of efficacy after 24 -weeks of treatment, this extension study will evaluate the need for additional teduglutide treatment in these subjects, and will allow the study of first -time treatment of ted uglutide- naïve subjects who participated in the standard of care (SOC) treatment arms in TED -C14-006 or SHP633 -301. Investigational product, dose, and m ode of administration: This study will allow repeat doses of teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) once daily (QD) injection for eligible pediatric subjects. There is no active comparator or reference product. Methodology: This is a Phase 3, prospective, open -label, long-term extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of teduglutide in pediatric subjects who completed the TED -C14-006 or SHP633 -301 studies (core studies). Once the informed consent (and if applicable, informed assent) have been reviewed and signed, demographics, and updates to medical history and short bow el syndrome histo ry will be obtained .Subjects not receiving teduglutide treatment (ie, in a no -teduglutide treatment [NTT] period), w ill be seen approximately every 12 weeks for safety, parenteral support (PS) requirements, and quality of life. The first NTT visit after the screening visit will occur within 2 to 12 w eeks of the screening visit . At any point after screening, including during a NTT period, subjects who meet ≥1 teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria , may proceed immediately to the pretreatment visit if the investigator, subject, and parent agree to proceed w ith teduglutide therapy . After the pre treatment visit, subjects who meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria, and meet none of the teduglutide treatment exclusion criteria, will start a 2 8-week cycle, consisting of 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment at 0.05 mg/kg SC once daily, followed by a 4 -week follow -up period (during which no teduglutide is administered) (Figure 3 -1). During the 28 -week cycle, clinic visits will occur at weeks 1, 2, 4 , 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28. Phone visits are required approximately 1 w eek after adjustments in PS during the teduglutide treatment period (betw een weeks 1 and 24), and w eekly during the teduglutide follow -up period (between weeks 24 and 28). Safety an d PS requirements will be evaluated at every visit, and quality of life assessments will be made approximately every 12 weeks.

Follow ing completion of the 28 -week treatment cycle, the subject w ill proceed to an NTT visit or another pretreatment visit within approximately 12 w eeks. Atallsitevisits andtelephon econtacts, safety willbemonitored andnutritional support willbereviewed and adjusted asneeded. Tomaintain consistency across centers, allattempts should bemade tofollow thenutritional support adjustment guidelines (developed withSBS expert inputandprovided intheprotocol) fordecisions regarding PSsupport reduction andadvances inenteral feeds based onweightgain, urine andstool output, and clinical stability. Departure from theguidelines, however, isnotconsidered aprotocol deviation .(Appendix 2). Study Design Flow Chart Figure legend: Safety and efficacy data for subjects not receiving teduglutide treatment are captured approximately every 12 weeks, but subjects may proceed to the pre treatment visit at any time in order to assess eligibility for teduglutide therapy. Eligible subjects will enter a 28 -week teduglutide cycle. During this cycle, subjects will return to the site for safety and efficacy assessments at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, and 24 ( solid black lines ). Ph one visits are required approximately 1 week after adjustments in PS during the intervening weeks between weeks 2 and 24 ( dashed grey lines ). Subjects discontinue teduglutide at week 24 and enter a 4 -week follow -up (no-treatment) period, during which phone visits will be performed weekly ( solid grey lines ). If an escape criterion is met at week 24 or during the follow -up period, subjects may proceed directly to another pretreatment visit. Study Inclusion Criteria: The subject will be considered eligible f or the study if they meet allof the study inclusion criteria. Teduglutide treatment eligibility does not impact study eligibility. 1.Subject provides w ritten informed consent (subject, parent or legal guardian and, as appropriate, informed assent) to participate in the study before completing any study -related procedures. 2.Subject completed the TED -C14-006 or SHP633 -301 studies (including subjects in the standard of care treatment arms). Subjects are considered to have completed SHP633 -301 if they compl eted study assessments through week 24. 3.Subject understands and is willing and able to fully adhere to study requirements as defined in this protocol. Study Exclusion Criteria: There are no exclusion criteria for this study. Teduglutide Eligibility Criteria: Subjects are eligible for teduglutide treatment if at least one ( ≥1) of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria, and none of the teduglutide treatment exclusion criteria, are met. In addition, the investigator and the subject (and/or parent or legal guardian, as appropriate) must agree to proceed with treatment.

258,page_258,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 24 SHP633 -304 Protocol Amendment 3 Teduglutide 16 May 2018 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 1.1 Indication and Current Treatment Options Short bowel sy ndrome (SBS) is a rare disorder resulting from congenital abnormalities or severe intestinal diseases that result in major surgical resections of the small intestine. I t is estimated that, at most, there are a few hundred pediatric subjects 1 y ear and older with SBS ( Khan et al., 2015; Wales et al., 2004 ).Unlike the adult population, the majority of cases of SBS in pediatric subjects are due to congenital anomalies or catastrophic events that occur during infancy . Although the small intestine is capable of remarkable adaptation, excessive loss of absorptive surface area or specialized functions can lead to dependence on parenteral nutrition or intravenous (IV) fluids (parenteral support [PS]). Treatment of both pedi atric and adult patients is focused on achieving adequate intestinal absorption to allow for minimization or discontinuation of PS. About 30% of infants with SBS become independent of PS requirements within 12 months of the initial insult, and an additiona l 10% wean off PS within 24 months. After this time, linear intestinal growth slows. About 60% of pediatric subjects with SBS are able to become independent of PS within 5 y ears of the initial diagnosis ( Khan et al., 2015 ). Nevertheless, despite optimal medical management, many pediatric subjects remain dependent on PS. Complications of long -term PS include liver disease, catheter -related blood stream infections, central line- associated venous thrombosis and dwindling central venous access. Sepsis is the leading cause of death in these patients and quality of life is poor ( Squires et al., 2012). Accelerating the adaptive process and achieving enteral autonomy is an urgent goal for all patients with SBS who are dependent on PS ( Khan et al., 2015; Squires et al., 2012 ). Intestinal adaptation is driven by hormonal cues in response to nutrient malabsorption ( Drucker and Yusta, 2014 ).Chief among these is hormones glucagon -like peptide 2 (GL P -2), which is secreted from L -type enteroendocrine cells that reside in the intestinal epithelium in the ileum and colon. Resection of these regions may impair the adaptive response by limiting endogenous production of GLP -2. 1.2 Product Background Teduglutide is a novel, re combinant analog of naturally occurring human GLP -2 that regulates the functional and structural integrity of the cells lining the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Teduglutide is a 33 -amino acid peptide that differs from native GLP- 2 in the substitution of glycine for alanine at the second position at the N - terminus. As a result, teduglutide demonstrates resistance to degradation by dipeptidy l peptidase- IV (DPP -4) and therefore maintains a longer elimination half -life (t 1/2) in adults of approximately 2 hours c ompared to the native peptide, which has a t 1/2 of approximately 7 minutes. Teduglutide has been shown in animal studies and previous human clinical trials to increase villus height and cry pt depth in the intestinal epithelium, thereb y increasing the absor ptive surface area of the intestines ( Tappenden et al., 2013; Thymann et al., 2014 ). The European Commission granted a centralized marketing authorization valid throughout the European Union (EU) for teduglutide (Revestive™) on 30 August 2012 and a New Drug Application (NDA) for teduglutide (Gattex®) was approved b y the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 21 Decem ber2012 for the treatment of adult patients with SBS who are dependent on PS. Teduglutide has also been approved for use in adult patients with SBS in Canada and Switzerland. On 29 Jun 2016, the For non-commercial use only"

In this study , teduglutide was administered to 3 cohorts of pediatric subjects from ages 1 -17. Thirty - seven pediatric subjects received teduglutide at doses of 0.0125, 0.025, or 0.05 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks. Five additional pediatric subjects were enrolled in an observational standard of care (SOC) cohort. There were clear dose -dependent effects of teduglutide seen at the 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day doses compared to SOC and the 0.0125 mg/kg/day dose. In the 0.025 mg/kg/day cohort there was a reduction in PS volume at w eek 12 of 37%, including complete independence from PS support in 1 subject, and a reduction of 3.94 hours per day infusion time. I n the 0.05 mg/kg/day cohort there w as a reduction in PS volume at w eek 12 of 39%, including complete independence from PS support in 3 subjects, and a reduction of 4.18 hours per day infusion time. Teduglutide was generall y safe and well tolerated b y pediatric subjects in all dosing cohorts. There were no deaths during the stud y and no treatment -emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) related to teduglutide were reported. No discontinuations from study were due to adverse events (AEs). TED -C14-006 is a recently completed study of pediatric sub jects through 17 y ears which included 2 treatment arms: a teduglutide treatment arm and a SOC treatment arm. Subjects in both arms participated in a 2 -week minimum screening period, a 24-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow -up period. During the scre ening period, subjects chose into which arm to enroll. During the 24 - week treatment period, subjects in the SOC treatment arm received standard medical therap y for SBS; while those in the teduglutide treatment arm received daily subcutaneous (SC) injection s of teduglutide (study drug) in addition to standard medical therap y. The subjects enrolling in the teduglutide treatment arm were randomized 1:1 in a double -blinded manner into 2 parallel dose groups: 0.025 mg/kg/day or 0.05 mg/kg/day of teduglutide admi nistered subcutaneously for 24 weeks. Compared to the SOC , treatment of pediatric subjects with SBS with teduglutide resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in PN/I V volume, calories, day s per week, and hours per day . A total 10% of subjects who rec eived teduglutide achieved enteral autonomy within 24 weeks despite prior dependence on PN/IV for several years. Teduglutide treatment also resulted in increases in EN volume and caloric intake as well as plasma citrulline. Although the differences in ef ficacy between the 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg dose groups were small, a consistently greater effect was seen in the 0.05 mg/kg dose in all efficacy parameters. The PK properties were well characterized in this population and were consistent with the prior 12 we ek pediatric study . Teduglutide was generally well tolerated by pediatric subjects with SBS. The safet y profile was favorable and consistent with the prior pediatric stud y, the underlying disease, and previous experience with teduglutide in adult subject s with SBS. SHP633 -301 is an ongoing stud y in the United Kingdom, Ital y, Finland, and France to evaluate the safet y, efficacy , and PK of teduglutide treatment in infants 4 to 12 months of age with SBS. Like TED -C14-006, this study has a teduglutide treatme nt arm and a SOC arm. Subjects in both arms will participate in a 2- week minimum screening period, a 24 -week treatment period, and a 4-week follow - up period.

In addition to evaluating the long -term safet y and durability of efficacy after 24 weeks of treatment, this extension study will evaluate the need for additional teduglutide treatment in these subjects, and will allow for the first- time treatment of te duglutide -naïve subjects who participated in the SOC treatment arms in TED- C14-006 or SHP633 -301. 2.2 Study Objectives 2.2.1 Primary Objectives The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long -term safet y and tolerability of teduglutide treatment in pediat ric subjects with SBS who completed TED -C14-006 or SHP633 - 301. 2.2.2 Secondary Objectives The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the long -term efficacy of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects with SBS who completed TED -C14-006 or SHP633-301.

At the time of entry into TED -C14-006, subjects were less than 18years of age, were dependent on parenteral nutrition to provide at least 30% of their caloric or fluid needs, and had not been able to significantly reduce PS for at least 3 month s prior to enrollment. During TED -C14-006, some subjects elected to receive standard of care instead of teduglutide treatment. Subjects who elected to receive teduglutide were randomized to 0.025 mg/kg or 0.05 mg/kg once dail y (QD) dosing in a double -blind ed manner. At the time of entry into SHP633- 304, subjects were 4 to 12 months corrected gestational age, were dependent on parenteral nutrition to provide at least 35% of their caloric or fluid needs, and had not been able to significantly reduce PS for a t least 1 month prior to enrollment. During SHP633 -301, subjects were randomized to receive s tandard of care or teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg SC QD. Approximately 65 subjects who complete the core studies are expected to enroll in this extension study . All subje cts who completed either core study , including those who received standard of care, may be eligible to enter SHP633-304. To be eligible to receive teduglutide treatment within SHP633- 304, subjects must meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criter ia and none of the teduglutide treatment exclusion criteria. Additional Teduglutide Treatment Subjects not receiving teduglutide treatment (ie, in a “no- teduglutide treatment period”), will be seen approximately every 12 weeks for safety , parenteral support (PS) requirements, and qualit y of life. At an y point during a no -teduglutide treatment perio d, subjects who meet ≥1 teduglutide treatment inclusion may proceed directl y to the pretreatment visit if the investigator, subject, and parent agree to proceed with teduglutide therapy . Rationale: Some pediatric subjects may have a durable beneficial effe ct after 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment and thus long -term follow -up without additional teduglutide treatment may be appropriate. However, there may be some pediatric subjects who deteriorate or stop improving after discontinuation of teduglutide treatm ent. I n these pediatric subjects, additional teduglutide treatment may be beneficial. Dose Selection Analy sis suggested that pediatric patients, ages 1 to 17 y ears old, are likel y to require the same dose as used in adults, namely 0.05 mg/kg/day (Mouksassi et al., 2009 ).In this extension study , all subjects who enter a teduglutide treatment cy cle will receive 0.05 mg/kg SC QD. Rationale: Teduglutide is approved for adult use in the US and EU, and for pediatric use in the EU, at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg SC once daily . The completed pediatric studies (TED -C13-003 and TED -C14-006) demonstrated that teduglutide dosing at 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day was associated with a favorable benefit/risk profile. In addition, population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations were conducted to determine the effective dose to be used in pediatric subjects using data from 8 adult clinical studies including adult Phase 1 studies and Phases 2/3 For non-commercial use only"
263,page_263,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 29 SHP633 -304 Protocol Amendment 3 Teduglutide 16 May 2018 studies as wel l as the pediatric study (TED -C13-003) and suggested that the dose in pediatric subjects is likely to be same as the dose in adults ( O'Keefe et al., 2006 ). Further PK simulation was conducted based on the population PK model previously established and a virtual population of 1000 pediatric patients created based on Centers for Disease Control (CDC) growth charts in the target age group (4 to 12 months) and taking into consideration bod y weights of pediatric patients with SBS enrolled in study TED -C13-003 (approximately 15% lower than healthy subjects in the same age group). Monte Carlo simulations for all age groups were performed according to the SC dosing regimens of 0.0125, 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg every 24hours. Rich concentration- time profiles were simulated with the customized population P K model to derive the exposure metrics area under the concentration curve at steady state (AUC ss) and maximum concentration at steady state (C max,ss). Following 0.05 mg/kg daily SC administration, the median C max,ss of teduglutide in infants (24.9 ng/mL ) was within 20% of that observed in the 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 y ears age groups (26.9 and 29.4 ng/mL , respectively ); and approximately ~28% lower than that in adult patients with SBS. The clinical package in conjunction with C maxwas considered to support teduglu tide dose of 0.05 mg/kg since AUC ss was previousl y shown not to correlate with efficacy. Thus, the 0.05 mg/kg dose is proposed for testing in all age groups. Duration of Treatment The duration of teduglutide treatment in this study mirrors that of the TED -C14-006 and SHP633 -301 studies, consisting of 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment, followed b y a 4 -week follow -up period. The follow -up period is a mechanism to evaluate whether continued teduglutide is needed. If a subject deteriorates during the follow -up period, the subject may be evaluated immediatel y for additional teduglutide treatment. Subjects who clinically deteriorate or stop improving at an y time after the end of the follow -up period will also be assessed for additional treatment. Rationale: During the teduglutide treatment cy cle, visit frequency is similar to frequencies performed in TED -C13-003, TED -C14-006, and SHP633 -301 to ensure sufficient safet y monitoring and weaning of PS. During the no -teduglutide treatment, visits occur every 12 weeks, a frequency that is consistent with standard medical practices. To minimize risk to subjects, those who have deteriorated quickly after treatment interruption (ie, escaped from a prior follow-up period) may be evaluated immediately for eligibility for additi onal treatment when they reach the week 24 visit. Measures and Parameters Following the review and signing of the informed consent (and informed assent, if applicable), screening visit procedures will begin including demographics, and updates to medical h istory and SBS history . Subjects who meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria may proceed to the pretreatment visit. After the pretreatment visit, subjects who still meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria, and meet none of the teduglutide treatment exclusion criteria, will start a 28- week cy cle, consisting of 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment at 0.05 mg/kg SC once daily , followed by a 4- week follow -up (no treatment) period ( Figure 3-1). During the 28 -week cycle, clinic visits will occur at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28. Phone visits are required approximately For non-commercial use only"

Safety and PS requirements will be evaluated on a weekl y basis, and quality of life assessments will be made approximately every 12 weeks. At all site visits and telephone contacts, safety will be monitored and nutritional support will be re viewed and adjusted as needed. To maintain consistency across centers, all attempts should be made to follow the nutritional support adjustment guidelines (developed with SBS expert input and provided in the protocol) for decisions regarding PS reduction and advances in enteral feeds based on weight gain, urine and stool output, and clinical stability . Departure from the guidelines, however, is not considered a protocol deviation ( Appendix 2 ). Rationale: Measures of long term safet y will include adverse eve nts, growth parameters and anti- drug antibodies. Measure of long term efficacy will include durability of effect as measured b y reduction in PS and improvement in pediatric quality of life measures (PedsQL , PedsQL Family Impact Module). A reduction in PS v olume of at least 20% at end of treatment (EOT) was used as the primary endpoint in pivotal phase 3 adult clinical trials and the completed phase 3 pediatric stud y (TED -C13-003), and will be used as an endpoint in this extension study . In previous clinical studies, a reduction of this magnitude was associated with a reduction in the number of day s per week of PS, and increases in enteral intake. Reduction in volume and time of PS due to improved enteral absorption may provide a pediatric subject with opport unities for more age -appropriate activities including oral rehabilitation. Quality of life assessments will be performed in this study to quantitate this effect. Teduglutide has been found to have a targeted intestinotrophic effect. Taking into account the patient population and the pharmacologic effect of teduglutide, GI -specific screening tests, including fecal occult blood testing and colonoscopy /sigmoidoscopy , which are commonl y part of the routine care of these subjects, will be performed to ensure saf ety. This study captures long - term safet y data on polyps and other colonic mucosal changes in teduglutide -exposed subjects using the surveillance strategy proposed in Section 7.2.9.

L imited responsibility may be delegated to the pharmacy or member of the stud y team, but this delegation must be documented. Study drug must be kept in a locked area with access restricted to specific study personnel. Study drug will be stored refrigerated at a temperature between 2 to 8°C (35.6 to 46.4°F) unt il dispensed to a subject. Once dispensed to a subject, the study drug can be stored refrigerated or up to a controlled room temperature (acceptable range of 2 to 25°C, or 35.6 to 77°F). Parent/guardian will be instructed to keep the subject’s stud y drug a nd sterile water diluent at controlled room temperature. If there are concerns that the controlled room temperature cannot be maintained, the stud y drug may be refrigerated. The study drug is for single use only , and should be used within 3 hours following reconstitution. Investigational product must be stored in accordance with labeled storage conditions. Temperature monitoring is required at the storage location to ensure that the investigational product is maintained within an established temperature ran ge. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the temperature is monitored throughout the duration of the study and that records are maintained; the temperature should be monitored continuously by using either an in-house sy stem, a mechanical recor ding device such as a calibrated chart recorder, or by manual means, such that both minimum and maximum thermometric values over a specific time period can be recorded and retrieved as required. Such a device (ie, certified min/max thermometer) would requi re manual resetting upon each recording. The sponsor must be notified immediately upon discovery of any excursion from the established range. Temperature excursions will require site investigation as to cause and remediation. The sponsor will determine the ultimate impact of excursions on the investigational product and will provide supportive documentation as necessary . Under no circumstances should the product be dispensed to subjects until the impact has been determined and the product is deemed appropri ate for use b y the sponsor. The sponsor should be notified immediately if there are an y changes to the storage area of the investigational product that could affect the integrity of the product(s), eg, fumigation of a storage room. Investigational products are distributed b y the pharmacy or nominated member of the stud y team. The pharmacist/nominated team member will enter the unique subject identifier on the investigational product bottle/carton labels, as they are distributed. 6.4 Drug Accountability Investigators will be provided with sufficient amounts of the investigational product to carry out this protocol for the agreed number of subjects. The investigator or designee will acknowledge receipt of the investigational product, documenting shipment c ontent and condition. The investigator is to keep a current record of the inventory and dispensation of all clinical supplies. This record will be made available to the sponsor’s site monitor for the purpose of accounting for all clinical supplies. Any discrepancy or deficiency will be recorded and will include an explanation. All supplies sent to the investigator must be accounted for and in no case will clinical supplies be used in any unauthorized situation. For non-commercial use only"
275,page_275,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 41 SHP633 -304 Protocol Amendment 3 Teduglutide 16 May 2018 The investigator has overall responsibility for administering/dispensing investigational product. Where permissible, tasks may be delegated to a qualified designee (eg, a pharmacist) who is adequatel y trained in the protocol and who works under the direct supervision of the investigator. This delegati on must be documented in the applicable study delegation of authority form. The investigator or his/her designee (as documented by the investigator in the applicable study delegation of authorit y form) will dispense the investigational product only to subjects eligible for teduglutide treatment following the procedures set out in the study protocol. All dispensed study medication will be documented in the interactive response technology system and/or other investigational product record (eg, investigation p roduct accountability form). The investigator is responsible for assuring the retrieval of all stud y supplies from subjects. All used and unused study drug vials must be returned by the subjects and/or parent/guardian, and will be retained at the site. If deemed appropriate, the investigator or his/her designee may dispense the unused study drug vials to the same subject. All original containers, whether empty or containing stud y drug will be returned to the pharmacy. Returned stud y drugs will NOT be relabe led or reassigned for use by other subjects. Contents of the study drug containers will not be combined. All used and unused vials must be returned to the distribution center according to the sponsor’s instruction. No vial/kit may be destroy ed on site with out approval by the sponsor. Please see the Pharmacy Manual for additional information. 6.5 Subject Compliance Subjects will be instructed to bring their unused investigational product and empty /used investigational product packaging to every visit. Drug accountability will be assessed at the container/packaging level for unused investigational product that is contained within the original tamper -evident sealed container (eg, bottles, tray s, vials) or at the individual count level for opened containers/packagi ng. The pharmacist/nominated person will record details on the drug accountability form. Compliance with study drug is calculated from subject diaries. Of those subjects eligible for teduglutide treatment, subjects who have received 80% of the planned dose s administered will be assessed as being compliant with the study protocol.

The investigator may combine the CxW24 assessments with the next pre treatment visit assessments if at least 1 escape criterion is met at the CxW24 visit and the pretreatment assessments occur within 7 day s of the CxW24 visit. Phone Visits Phone visits are required approximately 1 week after adjustments in PS during the te duglutide treatment period. Phone visit assessments and procedures are outlined in Table 1 -3and described below: Review intake and output diaries Safety laboratory tests (clinical chemistry and urinaly sis) Record PS prescription and adjust as needed Obtain AEs, concomitant medications, and concomitant procedures Evaluate escape criteria 7.1.4 Teduglutide Follow -up Period The safet y follow -up period for this protocol is 4 weeks (w eeks 25 – 28 of the cy cle). Phone visits will occur on cy cle weeks 25, 26, and 27 for all subjects. Phone visit assessments and procedures at weeks 25 -27 will be the same as for telephone visits performed during the teduglutide treatment period. I n addition, subjects will be evaluated for follow -up period escape criteria. If escape criteria are met at an y time during the follow -up period, the subject may proceed directl y to another pretreatment visit at the investigator’s discretion. The investigator may combine the CxW24 or CxW28 visits with the next pretreatment visit if at least 1escape criterion is met at the CxW24 or CxW28 visits, and the pretreatment assessments occur within 7days of the CxW24 or CxW28 visit. I f a subject is completing the study at the CxW28 visit, the EOS/ET visit (Section 7.1.5 ) will take place in lieu of t he CxW28 visit. Otherwise, following completion of the 28 -week treatment cy cle, the subject will proceed to an NTT visit within approximately 12 weeks.

Any new clinicall y significant findings noted during physical examinations should be recorded on the appropriate AE page of the eCRF. 7.2.3 Vital Signs, Body Weight, Height, Head Circumference and Body Mass Index Vital signs will be measured according to the study schedules. Measurements will include systolic an d diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), pulse (beats per minute), and body temperature (°C/°F). Blood pressure should be determined b y cuff (using the same method, the same extremity , and in the same position throughout the study , whenever possible). Body weigh t will also be recorded in the eCRF; subjects should be weighed on the same scale at each stud y visit. Height (or length) and head circumference (for subjects ≤36 months of age) will be measured at selected visits. A height z- score, weight z -score, BM I, and BMI z -score will be calculated b y the sponsor using the site -provided height and weight data collected at each site visit New clinicall y significant vital sign abnormalities should be recorded on the appropriate AE page of the eCRF. 7.2.4 Clinical Laboratory T ests Safety laboratory tests to be performed at site visits consist of clinical chemistry , hematology , and urinal ysis and will be performed as outlined in the study plan ( Table 1-1, Table 1-2, and Table 1-3) Scheduled laboratory testing will be processed b y a central lab. All laboratory assay s will be performed according to the central laboratory ’s normal procedures. Reference ranges are to be supplied by the laboratory . The investigator should assess out-of -range clinical laboratory values for clinical sig nificance, indicating if the value(s) is/are not clinically significant or clinically significant. Abnormal clinical laboratory values, which are unexpected or not explained by the subject’s clinical condition, may , at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor, be repeated as soon as possible until confirmed, explained, or resolved. During the teduglutide treatment period, subjects will also have safet y labs within approximately 5-7 day s after a PS adjustment. Safety labs performed after PS adjustment and between site visits will consist of clinical chemistry and urinal ysis and may be processed by the central laboratory or a local laboratory . Local lab results are not required to be entered in the eCRFs; however, if the local lab results indicate an y new clinicall y significant changes, they must be reported as an adverse event (see Section 8.1). Urine specimen collection should be attempted as part of the safet y labs, but lack of urinalysis will not constitute a protocol deviation.

Urine pregnancy tests will be administered at all other visits according to the study schedules, or if pregnancy is suspected, or as specified per protocol upon withdrawal of the subject from the study . 7.2.7 Antibody Testing Blood samples will be drawn for the anal ysis of antibodies to teduglutide according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1-1, Table 1 -2, and Table 1 -3). Blood samples for antibodies may be drawn from a central line or from peripheral access. The sample drawn on CxD1 must be drawn prior to administration of the first dose of teduglutide. Once the subject has started teduglutide treatment, samples must be drawn at least 14 hours after dosing. Subjects who test positive for antibodies to teduglutide will also be tested for neutralizing antibody . Subjects who have been previousl y treated with teduglutide, and who test positive for antibodies to teduglutide, will have follow-up blood draws for antibodies to teduglutide every 12 weeks while on study until a negative result is obtained. 7.2.8 Volume of Blood Efforts will be made to minimize the amount of blood drawn from all pediatric subjects enrolled in this study .

The amount of blood to be drawn may vary according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer or laboratory for an individual assessment. When more than 1 blood assessment is to be done at the time point/p eriod, if they require the same t ype of tube, the assessments should be combined. Blood volume estimates do not include safet y labs performed after PS adjustment, and anti -teduglutide antibody testing during no- teduglutide treatment. Saved serum samples s hould be omitted for subjects weighing less than 10 kg and whenever local blood volume limitations are exceeded. 7.2.9 Gastrointestinal- specific Testing 7.2.9.1 Fecal Occult Blood Testing Fecal occult blood testing must be perfo rmed on all subjects at the pre treatment visit, week 12, and week 24 of the teduglutide cy cle. During NTT periods, FOBT must be performed on teduglutide -exposed subjects (subjects who have received teduglutide an y time in the past and are therefore not teduglutide -naïve) on a roughl y annual basis (approximately every 48-60 weeks). Actions to be taken in response to a positive FOBT are described below. 7.2.9.2 Colonoscopy or Sigmoidoscopy Teduglutide -naïve subjects age 12 and older will undergo colonosc opy or sigmoidoscopy at the pretreatment visit if one has not been performed within 1 y ear. Subjects of an y age with newly positive FOBT res ults at the pretreatment visit for which a readil y detectable cause cannot be identified (eg, anal fissure) will undergo a colonoscop y or sigmoidoscop y prior to receivin g teduglutide. If newly positive FOBT results (for which a readil y detectable cause cannot be identified) are obtained at the end of a teduglutide treatment cycle (CxW24/EOT), colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy will be performed. The need for colonoscop y or sigm oidoscopy in response to positive FOBTs at any other point during the study , or to re -evaluate persistently positive FOBTs is at the discretion of the investigator. Teduglutide -exposed subjects who have received the equivalent of 2 treatment cy cles (48 weeks of study drug exposure) will undergo colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy . While receiving additional teduglutide treatment, subjects will undergo colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy at 5 y ear intervals or more often as needed. Upper endoscop y ma y be performed along with any colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy at the investigator’s discretion. If a pol yp is found, adherence to current pol yp follow -up guidelines is recommended. Subjects with unresected GI po lyps, poly posis conditions, pre malignant change or malignancy in the GI tract will be excluded from teduglutide treatment. 7.2.10 Nutritional Support Nutritional support includes PS, EN , and other food and fluids. Advances in ENand/or reductions to PS will be based on clinical status, including weight, linear growth, hy dration status, and safet y laboratory results. Intake and output diaries will include data to be considered in the adjustment of each subject’s nutritional support. Guidelines for nutritional support management and weaning algorithms are provided in Appendix 2 . For non-commercial use only"

This diary should be completed b y the subject (or parent/legal guardian, as applicable) dail y during the teduglutide treatment periods (betwee n visits CxD1 and CxW24). 7.2.11.2 Intake Diary Intake diaries will be used to collect and evaluate each subject’s nutritional support. The subject/parent/guardian will complete the appropriate fields of the PS section of the intake diary 2 weeks prior to ALL sched uled site visits (except a t pretreatment visit). During the 24 -week teduglutide treatment period, the intake diary will also be completed for 1 week following PS adjustments. The intake diary will also be completed daily during the 4 -week follow -up period. The following data will be captured in the intake diaries: Parenteral support volume and infusion duration Site personnel will determine the actual PS daily calories based on diary entries. All available diary data will be reviewed by the investigator or their designee at each clinic and telephone visit to assess clinical status and opportunity for PS reduction and advance in feeds. 7.2.11.3 Output Diary Urine and stool output should be recorded in the output diary over a 48- hour period of nutritional stability before every clinic visit; in addition, output should be recorded for subjects that are in a teduglutide treatment cy cle within 1 week of implementing a change in the PS prescription, regardless of previous teduglutide exposure. Urine data: Toilet -trained sub jects (who do not wear diapers) Measure and record all urine output in mL or cc Nontoilet- trained subjects (who wear diapers) Measure and record the weight of all urine -only diapers. Urine volume will be calculated using the following formula: 1 g (scale weight) = 1 mL or 1 cc At the discretion of the investigator, the parent may be asked to collect the first void after the daily PS infusion to measure specific gravity Stool data (includes diapers with mixed urine and stool): Toilet -trained subjects (who do not wear diapers) Record the occurrence of each bowel movement and score the stool consistency using the Bristol Stool Form Scale (see Output diary ) Nontoilet- trained subjects (who wear diapers) Record the weight of diapers containing stool (including d iapers with mixed urine and stool) as stool output and score the stool consistency using the Bristol Stool Form Scale For non-commercial use only"

All available diary data will be reviewed by the investigator or their designee at each clinic and telephone visit to assess clinical status and opportunity for PS reduction and advance in feeds. 7.2.12 Health -related Quality of Life Assessments Throughout the stud y, health -related quality of life assessments will be performed using the PedsQL Generic Core Scales. Each PedsQL age- appropriate form takes less than 4 minutes to complete. The scales include self -reports for pediatric subjects and adolescents aged 5 to 18years and prox y-reports from parents of pediatric subjects aged 2 to 18 years. The PedsQL Generic Core Scales will not be performed for subjects y ounger than 2 y ears of age. If a child is unable to complete the age -appropriate questionnaire (eg, due to developmental delay or other illness) it will not constitute a protocol deviation, but the parent should continue to complete the appropriate parent -specific forms. Field trials hav e shown that the internal consistency reliability of the PedsQL was excellent, with alphas for the generic core scales in both self -and proxy -report greater than the 0.70 standard, and alphas for the full 23 -item scale approaching 0.90 for self -and prox y-report. Missing data were minimal. Item response distributions were across the full scale range, with no floor effects, and minimal ceiling effects. The validity of the PedsQL Generic Core Scales was demonstrated through known group comparisons, and corr elations with other measures of disease burden. The PedsQL self-and proxy-report distinguished between pediatric subjects with and without a chronic health condition, and within the group of pediatric subjects with a chronic condition, between those who did or did not have an overnight hospital visit in the last 12 months. Further, both child self - report and parent prox y-report correlated significantly with the number of days the child was too ill to pursue normal activities, needed someone to care for him or her, missed school in the last month, the number of day s the parent missed from work in the last month, and parent -report of problems pursuing their normal work routine and concentrating at work. The PedsQL Generic Core Scales are also responsive to clinical change, as demonstrated in field trials. 7.2.12.1 Pediatric Quality of Life Generic Core Scale (PedsQL™), Acute version The PedsQL Generic Core Scale is designed to measures health -related quality of life (HRQoL) in pediatric subjects and adolescents (2 -18 years of age). The developmentally appropriate PedsQL Generic Core Scale will be completed by either the parent or legal guardian and subject as indicated in Table 7 -3at the time points as outlined in Table 1-1, Table 1 -2, and Table 1 - 3.

An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigati onal) product (ICH Guidance E2A 1995). All AEs are collected from the time the informed consent is signed until the defined follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.4 . This includes events occurring during the screening phase of the study , regardless of whe ther or not investigational product is administered. Where possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of sy mptoms should be recorded. If a diagnosis has not been made, then each s ymptom should be listed individually . All AEs should be captured on the appropr iate AE pages in the eCRF and in source documents. In addition to untoward AEs, unexpected benefits outside the investigational product indication should also be captured on the AE eCRF. All AEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returne d to his/her baseline status or all variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the study . Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved (the investigator does not expect any furthe r improvement or worsening of the event), or the event is otherwise explained. When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of event(s) can be documented. 8.1.1 Severity Categorization The severit y of AEs must be recorded dur ing the course of the event including the start and stop dates for each change in severity. An event that changes in severity should be captured as a new event. Worsening of pretreatment events, after initiation of investigational product, must be recorded as new AEs (for example, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dy spepsia prior to dosing of investigational product, but the dy spepsia becomes severe and more frequent after first dose of investigational product has been administered, a new AE of sev ere dy spepsia [with the appropriate date of onset] is recorded on the appropriate eCRF). The medical assessment of severit y is determined by using the following definitions: Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living. Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of dai ly living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject. Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantl y affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. For non-commercial use only"
290,page_290,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 56 SHP633 -304 Protocol Amendment 3 Teduglutide 16 May 2018 In consideration of whether a treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) might lead to dose interruption (Section 8.4.1) or early termination of the study (Section 8.5), severe TEAEs will also be graded according to the National Cancer Institute ’s (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) severit y grading criteria ( US Department of Health and Human Services et al., 2010 ). 8.1.2 Relationship Categorization A phy sician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused b y the investigational product. If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related”. Otherwise, if there is an y valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect relationship between the invest igational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related”. The causality assessment must be documented in the source document. The following additional guidance may be helpful: Term Relationship Definition RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or suspected response pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained by the subject’s medical condition, other therap ies, or accident. Not RelatedThe event can be readil y explained by other factors such as the subject’s underl ying medical condition, concomitant therapy , or accident and no plausible temporal or biologic relationship exists between the investigational product and the event. AEs that are related to study drug that are not resolved at EOT will be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes, as judged b y the investigator. Laboratory values, vital signs, and clinical findings at the scheduled ph ysicalexaminations must be reported as AEs if the investigator considers the finding to be a clinicall y significant change from the baseline. 8.1.3 Outcome Categorization The outcome of AEs must be recorded during the course of the stud y in the eCRF. Outcomes are asfollows: Fatal Not Recovered/Not Resolved Recovered/Resolved Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae Recovering/Resolving For non-commercial use only"

When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the reference range, the duration until return to the reference range, either while continuing treatment or after the end of treatment with the investigational product, and the range of variation of the respective parameter within its reference range, must be taken into consideration. If, during the stud y, there are abnormal clinical laboratory values or vital signs which were not present at the beginning of the study , further investigations should be performed until the values return to within the reference range or until a plausible explanation (eg, concomitant disease) is found for the abnormal values. The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory or vital sign is clinicall y significant and therefore represents an AE. 8.1.6 Pregnancy All pregnancies are to be reported from the time informed consent is signed until the defined follow -up per iod stated in Section 7.1.4. Any report of pregnancy for any female study participant must be reported within 24 hours to the Shire Global Drug Safety Department using the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form. A copy of the Shi re Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form (and an y applicable follow - up reports) must also be sent to the Shire Medical Monitor using the details specified in the emergency contact information section of the protocol. In the event a subject becomes pregnant during the study , teduglutide administration must be discontinued immediately. Every effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome and condition of the infant. It is the responsibility of the investigat or to obtain this information within 30 calendar day s after the initial notification and appr oximately 30 calendar day s post partum. Pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clinical Study Adverse Event Form for Serious Adverse Events and Non- serious AEs as Required b y the Protocol. Note: An elective abortion is not considered an SAE.

Note: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply to reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless these result in an SAE. The ca tegories below are not mutually exclusive; the event can meet more than 1 category . Abuse –Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of investigatio nal product when used for a non -medical purpose (eg, to alter one’s state of consciousness or get high) in a manner that may be detrimental to the individual and/or society . Misuse –Intentional use of investigational product other than as directed or indicated at any dose (Note: this includes a situation where the investigational product is not used as directe d at the dose prescribed by the protocol). Overdose –Administration of a dose greater than the allocated dose of the study medication or at a frequency greater than the dosing interval specified by the protocol. Medication Error – An error made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and/or use of an investigational product. For studies, medication errors are reportable to the sponsor only as defined below. Cases of subjects missing doses of the investigational product are not considered reportable as medication errors. Medication errors should be collected/reported for all products under investigation. The administration and/or use of an expired investigational product should be considered as a reportable medication error. All investigational product provided to pediatric subjects should be supervised by the parent/legall y -authorized representative/caregiver. 8.2 Serious Adverse Event Procedures 8.2.1 Reference Safety Information The reference for safet y information for this study is the investigator brochure which the sponsor has provided under separate cover to all investigators. 8.2.2 Reporting Procedures All initial and follow -up SAE reports must be reported by the investigator to the Shire Global Drug Safet y Department andthe Shire Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event.

293,page_293,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 59 SHP633 -304 Protocol Amendment 3 Teduglutide 16 May 2018 All Adverse Events of Special Interest, as d efined in Section 8.3, must be reported by the investigator to the Shire Global Drug Safet y Department and the Shire Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event even if the event does not fulfill seriousness criterion. The investiga tor must complete, sign, and date the Shire Clinical Study Adverse Event Form for SAEs and Non- serious AEs as Required b y Protocol, and verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the form with the corresponding source documents (Note: Source docume nts are not to be sent unless requested). Fax or e -mail the completed form to the Shire Global Drug Safet y Department. A cop y of the completed Shire Clinical Study Adverse Event Form for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Non -serious AEs as Required b y Prot ocol (and any applicable follow -up reports) must also be sent to the Shire medical monitor or designee using the details specified in the emergency contact information section of the protocol. 8.2.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition Aserious adverse event ( SAE )is any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to investigational product or not) that at any dose: Results in death Is life -threatening. Note: The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of ""serious"" refers to an event in which th e subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. Note: Hospitalization s, which are the result of elective or previousl y scheduled surgery for pre existing conditions, which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not be classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a previousl y scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from a hospitalization for an elective or previousl y scheduled surgery that meet(s) serious criteria must be reported as SAE(s). Results in persistent or significant disability /inca pacity Is a congenital abnormality /birth defect Is an important medical event. Note: I mportant medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgme nt, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study ) are collected from the time the subject signs the informed consent until the defined follow- up period stated in Section 7.1.4, and must be reported For non-commercial use only"

In addition, any SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by the investigator at an y interval after the study has completed must be reported to the Shire Glo bal Drug Safet y Department within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. 8.2.5 Serious Adverse Event Onset and Resolution Dates The onset date of the SAE is defined as the date the event meets serious criteria. The resolution date is the date the event no longer meets serious criteria, the date the s ymptoms resolve, or the event is considered chronic. I n the case of hospitalizations, the hospital admission and discharge dates are considered the onset and resolution dates, respectivel y. In addition, any signs or sy mptoms experienced by the subject after signing the informed consent form, or leading up to the onset date of the SAE, or following the resolution date of the SAE, must be recorded as an AE, if appropriate. 8.2.6 Fatal Outcome Any SAE that results in the subject’s death (ie, the SAE was noted as the primary cause of death) must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution date. For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded. For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless another investigational product action was previously taken (eg, dr ug interrupted, reduced, withdrawn), the action taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not changed” or “not applicable” (if the subject never received investigational product). The investigational product action of “withdrawn” should not be selected solel y as a result of the subject’s death. 8.2.7 Regulatory Agency, Institutional Review Board, Ethics Committee, and Site Reporting The Sponsor and/or Clinical Contract Research Organization (CRO) is responsible for notify ing the relevant regulatory authorities, and US central I nstitutional Review Boards (IRBs)/EU central ethics committees (ECs), of related, unexpected SAEs. In addition, the Clinical CRO is responsible for notify ing active sites of all related, unexpected SAEs occu rring during all interventional studies across the SHP633 program. The investigator is responsible for notifying the local IRB, local EC, or the relevant local regulatory authorit y of all SAEs that occur at his or her site as required. 8.3 Adverse Events of Sp ecial Interest An AE of special interest is an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program and for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the investigator to the sponsor is requi red. The AEs of special interest that require expedited regulatory reporting include the following: Growth of pre -existing poly ps of the colon For non-commercial use only"

Attempts should be made to conta ct the sponsor/designee prior to dose interruption. Reasons for dosage interruptions may include but are not limited to hospitalization, AEs, a lapse in investigational product delivery , etc. Study drug must be discontinued if any of the following events occur: Pregnancy Severe h ypersensitivity , such as anaph ylaxis determined by the investigator to be related to study drug. This does not include the presence of anti- teduglutide antibodies, mild injection site reactions or mild sy mptoms that according to the investigator do not pose a significant risk to the subject. An AE that is of NCI CTCAE severit y Grade 3 or 4 and considered to be related to study drug administration Confirmed DILI related to teduglutide (see Section 8.4.2) 8.4.1 Dose Interruption Criteria Based on Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Investigational Product The investigational product must be discontinued if the subject experienced an AE that is of severit y ≥Grade 3 per the NCI CTCAE and is reported as relat ed to the investigational product. In consideration of whether a TEAE might lead to dose interruption, severe TEAEs will also be graded according to the NCI CTCAE severit y grading criteria ( US Department of Health and Human Services et al., 2010 ). All such TEAEs should be discussed with the Shire Medical Monitor or designee as soon as possible.

International normalized ratio should be measured with this set of verification laboratory assessments and an inquiry should be made as to the presence of clinica l symptoms consistent with new liver injury . The subject should be followed closely to determine the trajectory of the laboratory abnormalities and to evaluate the cause of liver injury . This evaluation may include, as clinically indicated, consideration o f sepsis, acute viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A immunoglobulin [IgM], hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibodies, cy tomegalovirus IgM, Epstein- Barr virus antibody panel), hepatobiliary obstruction (ultrasound), autoimmune hepatitis (anti-nuclear, anti-smooth muscle, anti -actin, or anti -liver kidney microsomal antibodies), intestinal failure associated liver disease, cardiovascular causes such as ischemic hepatitis, and concomitant hepatotoxic treatments. Additional evaluations may be performed at the discretion of the investigator in consultation with the Shire medical monitor. Teduglutide administration must be permanentl y discontinued if DILI is confirmed and deemed related to stud y drug. 8.5 Early Termination of the Clinical Study The data monitorin g committee ( DMC )may recommend stopping the study if any of the following conditions are met: ≥2subjects develop the same event of CTCAE severity Grade 3 that is reported as related to the investigational product or 1 subject develops an event of CTCAE s everity Grade 4 that is reported as related to the investigational product.

A study monito r will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and review the eCRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy . Discrepancies between source data and data entered in the eCRF will be addressed b y qualified site personnel. When a data discrepancy warrants correction, the correction will be made by authorized site personnel. Data collection procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit and/or at the investigator’s meeting. Unscheduled safet y follow up as sessments ( including visits conducted after EOS) are not to be collected unless requested. 9.2 Clinical Data Management Data are to be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRO’s data management process. Quality control and data validation proc edures are applied to ensure the validity and accuracy of the clinical database. Data are to be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requiring further clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring clarific ation are to be communicated to the site for resolution. Only authorized personnel will make corrections to the clinical database, and all corrections are documented in an auditable manner. 9.3 Statistical Analysis Process The study will be anal yzed by the sp onsor or its agent. All statistical anal yses will be performed using SAS®(SAS Institute, Cary , NC, USA) version 9.3 or higher. The statistical anal ysis plan (SAP) will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the analysis of the efficacy and safet y data, as well as describe the approaches to be taken for summarizing other study information such as subject disposition, d emographics and baseline characteristics, investigational product exposure, and prior and concomitant medications. 9.4 Planned Interim Analysis, and Data Monitoring Committee An interim anal ysis is planned when 6 months of safet y data have been collected for subjects entering from TED -C14-006. Additional interim analy ses may be conducted as needed. A DMC will be involved in the management of this study . The DMC members will review the data approximately every 3 months according to the DMC Charter. The DMC rev iew will include all cumulative safety data (ie, AEs, laboratory assessments, phy sical examinations, etc.) from study assessments through each cutoff period. Further details regarding the DMC can be found in the DMC charter, which will be available prior t o the administration of investigational product. The DMC for this study will be conducted in accordance with the FDA Guidance for Clinical Trial Sponsors: Establishment and Operation of Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Committees (March 2006).

Please consider the following clinical parameters identified as markers for adequate management of pediatric SBS. These parameters should also be considered for managing nutritional support (PS and/or oral/enteral feeding) in terms of volume and calories during the treatment period. Growth trajectory , including weight, heigh t (or length), and head circumference (for pediatric subjects up to 36 months of age) Other clinical evaluations Serum electrol ytes Blood urea nitrogen /creatinine levels Changes in stool frequency or volume, including mixed output Stool consistency (ie, Bristol Stool Scale) Urine specific gravit y General consideration to possible clinical deterioration in SBS Inability to maintain weight and growth velocity Diarrhea ( ≥10 bowel movements per day , ≥80 mL/kg/day from an ostomy, or ≥75mL/kg/day mixed output) Colic/vomiting frequency increased Electrol yte changes or imbalance Skin breakdown Adjustments should be based on the actual nutritional support in volume and calories the subject infuses. Subjects should remain compliant with the nutritional support pre scription in volume and calories during the stud y. Nutritional support constituents may be adjusted at the discretion of the investigator. During the 48 -hour output measurement period prior to the subject’s scheduled visit, no further changes to the prescr ibed nutritional support should be made. If there is a change in EN or other food or fluid intake, the investigator should consider this when adjusting the PS/EN support in volume and calories.

This study will enroll up to as many subjects as complete the TED -C14-006 and SHP633 -301 studies. Investigator(s): Multicenter study Site(s) and Region(s ): Approximately 28 investigational sites in North America and Europe w ill participate in this extension study Study period (planned): October 2016 –December 2020Clinical phase: 3 Extension Objectives: Prim ary: To evaluate the long -term safety and tolerability of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects w ith SBS. Secondary: To evaluate long -term efficacy of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects with SBS. Rationale: This is a Phase 3, prospective, open -label, long -term extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of teduglutide in pediatric subjects with short bow el syndrome (SBS) w ho completed either the TED -C14-006 or SHP633 -301 studies (the core studies). In addition to evaluating the long -term safety and durability of efficacy after 24 -weeks of treatment, this extension study will evaluate the need for additional teduglutide treatment in these subjects and will allow the study of first -time treatment of tedu glutide -naïve subjects who participated in the standard of care (SOC) treatment arms in TED -C14-006 or SHP633 -301. Investigational product, dose, and m ode of administration: This study will allow repeat doses of teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) o nce daily (QD) injection for eligible pediatric subjects. There is no active comparator or reference product. Methodology: This is a Phase 3, prospective, open -label, long-term extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of teduglutide in pediatri c subjects who completed the TED -C14-006 or SHP633 -301 studies (core studies). Once the informed consent (and if applicable, informed assent) have been reviewed and signed, demographics, and updates to medical history and short bow el syndrome history will be obtained .Subjects not receiving teduglutide treatment (ie, in a no -teduglutide treatment [NTT] period), w ill be seen approximately every 12 weeks for safety, parenteral support (PS) requ irements, and quality of life. The first NTT visit after the scree ning visit will occur within 2 to 12 w eeks of the screening visit . At any point after screening, including during a NTT period, subjects who meet ≥1 teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria , may proceed immediately to the pretreatment visit if the investigator, subject, and parent agree to proceed w ith teduglutide therapy . After the pretreatment visit, subjects who meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria, and meet none of the teduglutide treatment e xclusion criteria, will start a 28 -week cycle, consisting of 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment at 0.05 mg/kg SC once daily, followed by a 4 -week follow -up period (during which no teduglutide is administered) (Figure 3 -1). During the 28 -week cycle, clinic visits will occur at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28. Phone visits are required approximately 1 w eek after adjustments in PS during the teduglutide treatment period (betw een weeks 1 and 24), and w eekly during the teduglutide follow -up period (be tween weeks 24 and 28). Safety and PS requirements will be evaluated at every visit, and quality of life assessments will be made approximately every 12 weeks. For non-commercial use only"

Follow ing completion of the 28 -week treatment cycle, the subject will proceed to an NTT visit or another pretreatment visit within approximately 12 weeks. Atallsitevisits andtelephone contacts, safety willbemonitored andnutritional support willbereviewed and adjusted asneeded. Tomaintain consistency across centers, allattempts should bemade tofollow thenutritional support adjustment guideline s(developed withSBS expert input andprovided intheprotocol) fordecisions regarding PSsupport reduction andadvances inenteral feeds based onweightgain, urine andstool output, and clinical stability.

340,page_340,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 24 SHP633 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 Teduglutide 01Oct2019 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON 1.1 Indication and Current Treatment Options Short bowel sy ndrome (SBS) is a rare disorder resulting from congenital abnormalities or severe intestinal diseases that result in major surgical resections of the small intestine. I t is estimated that, at most, there are a few hundred pediatric subjects 1 y ear and older with SBS ( Khan et al., 2015; Wales et al ., 2004). Unlike the adult population, the majority of cases of SBS in pediatric subjects are due to congenital anomalies or catastrophic events that occur during infancy . Although the small intestine is capable of remarkable adaptation, excessive loss of absorptive surface area or specialized functions can lead to dependence on parenteral nutrition or intravenous (IV) fluids (parenteral support [PS]). Treatment of both pediatric and adult patients is focused on achieving adequate intestinal absorption to allow for minimization or discontinuation of PS. About 30% of infants with SBS become independent of PS requirements within 12 months of the initial insult, and an additional 10% wean off PS within 24 mont hs. After this time, linear intestinal growth slows. About 60% of pediatric subjects with SBS are able to become independent of PS within 5 y ears of the initial diagnosis ( Khan et al., 2015). Nevertheless, despite optimal medical management, many pediatric subjects remain dependent on PS. Complications of long -term PS include liver disease, catheter -related blood stream infections, central line- associated venous thrombosis and dwindling central venous access. Sepsis is the leading cause of death in these patients and quality of life is poor ( Squires et al., 2012). Accelerating the adaptive pro cess and achieving enteral autonomy is an urgent goal for all patients with SBS who are dependent on PS ( Khan et al., 2015; Squires et al., 2012 ). Intestinal adaptation is driven by hormonal cues in response to nutrient malabsorption ( Drucker and Yusta, 2014 ).Chief among these is hormones glucagon -like peptide 2 (GL P -2), which is secreted from L- type enteroendocrine cells that reside in the intestinal epithelium in the ileum and colon. Resection of these regions may impair the adaptive response by limiting endogenous production of GLP -2. 1.2 Product Background Teduglutide is a novel, recombinant analog of naturally occurring human GLP - 2 that regulates the functional and structural integrity of the cells lining the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Teduglutide is a 33 -amino acid peptide that differs from native GLP- 2 in the substitution of glycine for alanine at the second position at the N -terminus. As a result, teduglutide demonstrates resistance to degradation by dipeptidy l peptidase- IV (DPP -4) and therefor e maintains a longer elimination half -life (t 1/2) in adults of approximately 2 hours compared to the native peptide, which has a t 1/2 of approximately 7 minutes. Teduglutide has been shown in animal studies and previous human clinical trials to increase vi llus height and cry pt depth in the intestinal epithelium, thereb y increasing the absorptive surface area of the intestines ( Tappenden et al., 2013; Thymann et al. , 2014). The European Commission granted a centralized marketing authorization v alid throughout the European Union (EU) for teduglutide (Revestive™) on 30 August 2012 and a New Drug Application (NDA) for teduglutide (Gattex®) was approved b y the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 21 December 2012 for the treatment of adult patients with SBS who are dependent on PS.

On 29 Jun 2016, the European Commission granted an extension of the Market Authorization for teduglutide ( REVESTIVE ™) for the treatment of patients aged 1 y ear and above with SBS; patients should be stable following a period of intestinal adaptation. 1.3 Clinical Studies with Teduglutide in Pediatric Subjects One Phase 3 stud y, TED -C13-003, was completed in pedia tric SBS subjects in the US and United Kingdom (UK). In this study , teduglutide was administered to 3 cohorts of pediatric subjects from ages 1 -17. Thirty -seven pediatric subjects received teduglutide at doses of 0.0125, 0.025, or 0.05 mg/kg/day for 12 wee ks. Five additional pediatric subjects were enrolled in an observational standard of care (SOC) cohort. There were clear dose -dependent effects of teduglutide seen at the 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day doses compared to SOC and the 0.0125 mg/kg/day dose. In the 0.025 mg/kg/day cohort there was a reduction in PS volume at week 12 of 37%, including complete independence from PS support in 1 subject, and a reduction of 3.94 hours per day infusion time. I n the 0.05 mg/kg/day cohort there was a reduction in PS volume at week 12 of 39%, including complete independence from PS support in 3 subjects, and a reduction of 4.18 hours per day infusion time. Teduglutide was generall y safe and well tolerated b y pediatric subjects in all dosing cohorts. There were no deaths durin g the stud y and no treatment - emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) related to teduglutide were reported. No discontinuations from study were due to adverse events (AEs). TED -C14-006 is a recently completed study of pediatric subjects through 17 y ears which included 2 treatment arms: a teduglutide treatment arm and a SOC treatment arm. Subjects in both arms participated in a 2 -week minimum screening period, a 24-week treatment period, and a 4-week follow - up period. During the screening period, subjects ch ose into which arm to enroll. During the 24 -week treatment period, subjects in the SOC treatment arm received standard medical therap y for SBS; while those in the teduglutide treatment arm received daily subcutaneous (SC) injections of teduglutide (study drug) in addition to standard medical therapy . The subjects enrolling in the teduglutide treatment arm were randomized 1:1 in a double -blinded manner into 2 parallel dose groups: 0.025 mg/kg/day or 0.05 mg/kg/day of teduglutide administered subcutaneously for 24 weeks. Compared to the SOC, treatment of pediatric subjects with SBS with teduglutide resulted in clinicall y meaningful reductions in PN/IV volume, calories, day s per week, and hours per day . A total 10% of subjects who received teduglutide achieved enteral autonomy within 24 weeks despite prior dependen ce on PN/IV for several years. Teduglutide treatment also resulted in increases in EN volume and caloric intake as well as plasma citrulline. Although the differences in efficacy between the 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg dose groups were small, a consistently greater effect was seen in the 0.05 mg/kg do se in all efficacy parameters. The PK properties were well characterized in this population and were consistent with the prior 12 we ek pediatric study . Teduglutid e was generall y well tolerated b y pediatric subjects with SBS. The safet y profile was favorable and consistent with the prior pediatric stud y, the underl ying disease, and previous experience with teduglutide in adult subjects with SBS. SHP633 -301 is an ong oing study in the United Kingdom, Ital y, Finland, and France to evaluate the safet y, efficacy , and PK of teduglutide treatment in infants 4 to 12 months of age with SBS. Like TED -C14-006, this study has a teduglutide treatment arm and a SOC arm. For non-commercial use only"

I n addition to evaluating the long -term safet y and durability of efficacy after 24 weeks of treatment, this extension study will evaluate the need for additional teduglutide treatment in these subjects, and will allow for the first-time treatment of teduglutide- naïve subjects who par ticipated in the SOC treatment arms in TED -C14-006 or SHP633 -301. 2.2 Study Objectives 2.2.1 Primary Objectives The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long -term safet y and tolerability of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects with SBS who comple ted TED -C14-006 or SHP633 -301. 2.2.2 Secondary Objectives The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the long -term efficacy of teduglutide treatment in pediatric subjects with SBS who completed TED -C14-006 or SHP633-301.

At the time of entry into TE D-C14-006, subjects were less than 18 years of age, were dependent on parenteral nutrition to provide at least 30% of their caloric or fluid needs and had not been able to significantly reduce PS for at least 3 months prior to enrollment. During TED -C14-006, some subjects elected to receive standard of care instead of teduglutide treatment. Subjects who elected to receive teduglutide were randomized to 0.025 mg/kg or 0.05 mg/kg once dail y (QD) dosing in a double -blinded manner. At the time of entry into SHP633- 304, subjects were 4 to 12 months corrected gestational age, were dependent on parenteral nutrition to provide at least 35% of their caloric or fluid needs, and had not been able to significantly reduce PS for at least 1 month prior to enrollment. During SHP633 -301, subjects were randomized to receive standard of care or teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg SC QD. Approximately 65 subjects who complete the core studies are expected to enroll in this extension study . All subjects who completed either core study , including those who received standard of care, may beeligible to enter SHP633 -304. To be eligible to receive teduglutide treatment within SHP633 -304, subjects must meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria and none o f the teduglutide treatment exclusion criteria. Additional Teduglutide Treatment Subjects not receiving teduglutide treatment (ie, in a “no- teduglutide treatment period”), will be seen approximately every 12 weeks for safety , parenteral support (PS) requi rements, and qualit y of life. At an y point during a no -teduglutide treatment period, subjects who meet ≥1 teduglutide treatment inclusion may proceed directl y to the pretreatment visit if the investigator, subject, and parent agree to proceed with teduglutide therapy . Rationale: Some pediatric subjects may have a durable beneficial effect after 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment and thus long -term follow -up without additional teduglutide treatment may be appropriate. However, there may be some pediatric subjects who deteriorate or stop improving after discontinuation of teduglutide treatment. I n these pediatric subjects, additional teduglutide treatment may be beneficial. Dose Selection Analy sis suggested that pediatric patients, ages 1 to 17 y ears old, are likel y to require the same dose as used in adults, namely 0.05 mg/kg/day (Mouksassi et al., 2009 ).In this extension study , all subjects who enter a teduglutide treatment cy cle will receive 0.05 mg/kg SC QD. For non-commercial use only"
345,page_345,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 29 SHP633 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 Teduglutide 01Oct2019 Rationale: Teduglutide is approved for adult use in the US and EU, and for pediatric use in the EU, at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg SC once daily . The completed pediatric studies (TED -C13-003 and TED -C14-006) demonstrated that teduglutide dosing at 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg/day was associated with a fav orable benefit/risk profile. In addition, population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations were conducted to determine the effective dose to be used in pediatric subjects using data from 8 adult clinical studies including adult Phase 1 studies and Phase s 2/3 studies as well as the pediatric study (TED -C13-003) and suggested that the dose in pediatric subjects is likely to be same as the dose in adults ( O'Keefe et al., 2006 ). Further PK simulation was conducted based on the population PK model previously established and a virtual population of 1000 pediatric patients created based on Centers for Disease Control (CDC) growth charts in the target age group (4 to 12 months) and taking into consideration body weights of pediatric patients with SBS enrolled in study TED -C13-003 (approximately 15% lower than health y subjects in the same age group). Monte Carlo simulations for all age groups were performed according to the SC dosing regimens of 0.0125, 0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg every 24hours. Rich concentration- time profiles were simulated with the customized population PK model to derive the exposure metrics area under the concentration curve at stead y state (AUC ss) and maximum concentration at steady state (C max,ss). Following 0.05 mg/kg dail y SC administration, the median C max,ss of teduglutide in infa nts (24.9 ng/mL ) was within 20% of that observed in the 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 y ears age groups (26.9 and 29.4 ng/mL , respectively ); and approximately ~28% lower than that in adult patients with SBS. The clinical package in conjunction with C maxwas considered to support teduglutide dose of 0.05 mg/kg since AUC ss was previousl y shown not to correlate with efficacy. Thus, the 0.05 mg/kg dose is proposed for testing in all age groups. Duration of Treatment The duration of teduglutide treatment in this study mirror s that of the TED -C14-006 and SHP633 -301 studies, consisting of 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment, followed b y a 4 -week follow -up period. The follow -up period is a mechanism to evaluate whether continued teduglutide is needed. If a subject deteriorates dur ing the follow -up period, the subject may be evaluated immediatel y for additional teduglutide treatment. Subjects who clinically deteriorate or stop improving at an y time after the end of the follow- up period will also be assessed for additional treatment. Rationale: During the teduglutide treatment cy cle, visit frequency is similar to frequencies performed in TED -C13-003, TED -C14-006, and SHP633 -301 to ensure sufficient safet y monitoring and weaning of PS. During the no -teduglutide treatment, visits occur every 12 weeks, a frequency that is consistent with standard medical practices. To minimize risk to subjects, those who have deteriorated quickly after treatment interruption (ie, escaped from a prior follow-up period) may be evaluated immediately for elig ibility for additional treatment when they reach the week 24 visit.

Subjects who meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria may proceed to the pretreatment visit. After the pretreatment visit, subjects who still meet ≥1 of the teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria, and meet none of the teduglutide treatment exclusion criteria, will start a 28 -week cy cle, consisting of 24 weeks of teduglutide treatment at 0.05 mg/kg SC once daily , followed by a 4-week follow -up (no treatment) period ( Figure 3-1). During the 28- week cy cle, clinic visits will occur at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28. Phone visits are required approximately 1 week after adjustments in PS during the teduglutide treatment period (between weeks 1 -24), and weekl y during the teduglutide follow -up p eriod (between weeks 24 and 28). Safety and PS requirements will be evaluated on a weekl y basis, and quality of life assessments will be made approximately every 12 weeks. At all site visits and telephone contacts, safety will be monitored ,and nutritional support will be reviewed and adjusted as needed. To maintain consistency across centers, all attempts should be made to follow the nutritional support adjustment guidelines (developed with SBS expert input and provided in the protocol) for decisions regar ding PS reduction and advances in enteral feeds based on weight gain, urine and stool output, and clinical stability . Departure from the guidelines, however, is not considered a protocol deviation ( Appendix 2 ). Rationale: Measures of long -term safety will include AEs, growth parameters and anti -drug antibodies. Measure of long -term efficacy will include durability of effect as measured by reduction in PS and improvement in pediatric quality of life measures (PedsQL , PedsQL Family Impact Module). A reduction in PS volume of at least 20% at end of treatment (EOT) was used as the primary endpoint in pivotal phase 3 adult clinical trials and the completed phase 3pediatric study (TED -C13-003) and will be used as an endpoint in this extension study . In previous c linical studies, a reduction of this magnitude was associated with a reduction in the number of day s per week of PS and increases in enteral intake. Reduction in volume and time of PS due to improved enteral absorption may provide a pediatric subject with opportunities for more age -appropriate activities including oral rehabilitation. Quality of life assessments will be performed in this study to quantitate this effect. Teduglutide has been found to have a targeted intestinotrophic effect. Taking into accou nt the patient population and the pharmacologic effect of teduglutide, GI -specific screening tests, including fecal occult blood testing and colonoscopy /sigmoidoscopy , which are commonl y part of the routine care of these subjects, will be performed to ensu re safet y. This study captures long-term safet y data on poly ps and other colonic mucosal changes in teduglutide- exposed subjects using the surveillance strategy proposed in Section 7.2.9.

L imited responsibility may be delegated to the pharmacy or member of the stud y team, but this delegation must be documented. Study drug must be kept in a lo cked area with access restricted to specific study personnel. Study drug will be stored refrigerated at a temperature between 2 to 8°C (35.6 to 46.4°F) until dispensed to a subject. Once dispensed to a subject, the study drug can be stored refrigerated or up to a controlled room temperature (acceptable range of 2 to 25°C, or 35.6 to 77°F). Parent/guardian will be instructed to keep the subject’s stud y drug and sterile water diluent at controlled room temperature. If there are concerns that the controlled ro om temperature cannot be maintained, the stud y drug may be refrigerated. The study drug is for single use only , and should be used within 3 hours following reconstitution. Investigational product must be stored in accordance with labeled storage conditions . Temperature monitoring is required at the storage location to ensure that the investigational product is maintained within an established temperature range. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the temperature is monitored throughout the dur ation of the study and that records are maintained; the temperature should be monitored continuously by using either an in-house sy stem, a mechanical recording device such as a calibrated chart recorder, or by manual means, such that both minimum and maxim um thermometric values over a specific time period can be recorded and retrieved as required. Such a device (ie, certified min/max thermometer) would require manual resetting upon each recording. The sponsor must be notified immediately upon discovery of any excursion from the established range. Temperature excursions will require site investigation as to cause and remediation. The sponsor will determine the ultimate impact of excursions on the investigational product and will provide supportive documentati on as necessary . Under no circumstances should the product be dispensed to subjects until the impact has been determined and the product is deemed appropriate for use b y the sponsor. The sponsor should be notified immediately if there are an y changes to th e storage area of the investigational product that could affect the integrity of the product(s), eg, fumigation of a storage room. Investigational products are distributed b y the pharmacy or nominated member of the stud y team. The pharmacist/nominated team member will enter the unique subject identifier on the investigational product bottle/carton labels, as they are distributed. 6.4 Drug Accountability Investigators will be provided with sufficient amounts of the investigational product to carry out this protocol for the agreed number of subjects. The investigator or designee will acknowledge receipt of the investigational product, documenting shipment content and condition. The investigator is to keep a current record of the inventory and dispensation of all clinical supplies. For non-commercial use only"

Any discrepancy or deficiency will be recorded and will include an explanation. All supplies sent to the invest igator must be accounted for and in no case will clinical supplies be used in any unauthorized situation. The investigator has overall responsibility for administering/dispensing investigational product. Where permissible, tasks may be delegated to a qualified designee (eg, a pharmacist) who is adequatel y trained in the protocol and who works under the direct supervision of the investigator. This delegation must be documented in the applicable study delegation of authority form. The investigator or his/her designee (as documented by the investigator in the applicable study delegation of authorit y form) will dispense the investigational product only to subjects eligible for teduglutide treatment following the procedures set out in the study protocol. All disp ensed study medication will be documented in the interactive response technology system and/or other investigational product record (eg, investigation product accountability form). The investigator is responsible for assuring the retrieval of all stud y sup plies from subjects. All used and unused study drug vials must be returned by the subjects and/or parent/guardian, and will be retained at the site. If deemed appropriate, the investigator or his/her designee may dispense the unused study drug vials to the same subject. All original containers, whether empty or containing stud y drug will be returned to the pharmacy. Returned stud y drugs will NOT be relabeled or reassigned for use b y other subjects. Contents of the study drug containers will not be combined. All used and unused vials must be returned to the distribution center according to the sponsor’s instruction. No vial/kit may be destroy ed on site without approval by the sponsor. Please see the Pharmacy Manual for additional information. 6.5 Subject Compliance Subjects will be instructed to bring their unused investigational product and empty /used investigational product packaging to every visit. Drug accountability will be assessed at the container/packaging level for unused investigational product that is contained within the original tamper -evident sealed container (eg, bottles, tray s, vials) or at the individual count level for opened containers/packaging. The pharmacist/nominated person will record details on the drug accountability form. Compliance with study drug is calculated from subject diaries. Of those subjects eligible for teduglutide treatment, subjects who have received 80% of the planned doses administered will be assessed as being compliant with the study protocol.

A subject will have approximately 7 days, after completion of either the TED -C14-006 or SHP633- 301 studies, to sign consent to participate in the SHP633- 304 study . The first visit after screening must occ ur within 12 weeks of screening for a pretreatment visit, and within 2 to 12 weeks of screening for an NTx visit. The screening visit (Scr) assessments and procedures, beginning with informed consent, will be performed as outlined in Table 1-1, and as deta iled below: Informed consent, and informed assent (if applicable), is obtained Study eligibility is determined. A screen failure is a subject who has given informed consent and failed to meet the Study Inclusion Eligibility Criteria. Subjects cannot be rescreened once they have been designated as a screen failure. Demographics, updates to medical history and SBS history Intake and output diaries are dispensed Evaluate teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria Adverse events, concomitant medications and con comitant procedures 7.1.2 Visits for Subjects Not Receiving Teduglutide While outside of the 28- week teduglutide -treatment cy cle, subjects will be followed approximately every 12weeks for safety and efficacy assessments. No -teduglutide treatment visits are numb ered sequentially (NT1, NT2, etc.), even if interrupted by the treatment cy cles. The visit window (±7 days) is relative to the first NTx visit in the current NTT period. Assessments will be performed as outlined in Table 1 -2and described below . Intake and output diaries are dispensed Evaluate teduglutide treatment inclusion criteria Adverse events, concomitant medications and concomitant procedures Physical examination and vital signs, including weight Height and head circumference Review intake and output diaries For non-commercial use only"

Phone visits will occur on cy cle weeks 25, 26, and 27 for all subjects. Phone visit assessments and procedures at weeks 25 -27 will be the same as for telephone visits performed during the teduglutide treatment period. I n addition, subjects will be evaluated for follow -up period escape criteria. If escape criteria are met at an y time during the follow -up period, the subject may proceed direct ly to another pretreatment visit at the investigator’s discretion. The investigator may combine the CxW24 or CxW28 visits with the next pretreatment visit if at least 1 escape criterion is met at the CxW24 or CxW28 visits, and the pretreatment assessments occur within 7days of the CxW24 or CxW28 visit. I f a subject is completing the study at the CxW28 visit, the EOS/ET visit (Section 7.1.5 ) will take place in lieu of the CxW28 visit. Otherwise, following completion of the 28 -week treatment cy cle, the subje ct will proceed to an NTT visit within approximately 12 weeks.

All laboratory assay s will be performed according to the central laboratory ’s normal procedures. Reference ranges are to be supplied by the laboratory . The investigator should assess out-of- range clinical laborat ory values for clinical significance, indicating if the value(s) is/are not clinically significant or clinically significant. Abnormal clinical laboratory values, which are unexpected or not explained by the subject’s clinical condition, may , at the discre tion of the investigator or sponsor, be repeated as soon as possible until confirmed, explained, or resolved. During the teduglutide treatment period, subjects will also have safet y labs within approximately 5-7 day s after a PS adjustment. Safety labs per formed after PS adjustment and between site visits will consist of clinical chemistry and urinal ysis and may be processed by the central laboratory or a local laboratory . Local lab results are not required to be entered in the eCRFs; however, if the local lab results indicate an y new clinicall y significant changes, they must be reported as an AE(see Section 8.1). Urine specimen collection should be attempted as part of the safety labs, but lack of urinal ysis will not constitute a protocol deviation. New clinicall y significant labs should be reported as AEs.

During NTT periods, FOBT must be performed on teduglutide -exposed subjects (subjects who have received teduglutide an y time in the past andare therefore not teduglutide -naïve) on a roughly annual basis (approximately every 48-60 weeks). Actions to be taken in respo nse to a positive FOBT are described below. 7.2.9.2 Colonoscopy or Sigmoidoscopy Teduglutide -naïve subjects age 12 and older will undergo colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy at the pretreatment visit if one has not been performed within 1 y ear. Subjects of an y age with newly positive FOBT results at the pretreatment visit for which a readil y detectable cause cannot be identified (eg, anal fissure) will undergo a colonoscop y or sigmoidoscop y prior to receiving teduglutide. If newly positive FOBT results (for which a readi ly detectable cause cannot be identified) are obtained at the end of a teduglutide treatment cycle (CxW24/EOT), colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy will be performed. The need for colonoscop y or sigmoidoscopy in response to positive FOBTs at an y other point durin g the study , or to re -evaluate persistently positive FOBTs is at the discretion of the investigator. Teduglutide -exposed subjects who have received the equivalent of 2 treatment cy cles (48 weeks of study drug exposure) will undergo colonoscopy or sigmoido scopy. While receiving additional teduglutide treatment, subjects will undergo colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy at 5 y ear intervals or more often as needed. Upper endoscop y ma y be performed along with any colonoscop y or sigmoidoscopy at the investigator’s dis cretion.

The subject/parent/guardian will complete the appropriate fields of the PS section of the intake diary 2 weeks prior to ALL scheduled site visits (except at pretreatment visit). During the 24 -week teduglutide treatment period, the intake diary will also be completed for 1 week following PS adjustments. The intake diary will also be completed daily during the 4 -week follow -up period. The following data will be captured in the intake diaries: Parenteral support volume and infusion duration Site personnel will determine the actual PS daily calories based on diary entries. All available diary data will be reviewed by the investigator or their designee at each clinic and telephone visit to assess clinical status and opportunity for PS reduction and advance in feeds. 7.2.11.3 Output Diary Urine and stool output should be recorded in the output diary over a 48- hour period of nutritional stability before every clinic visit; in addition, output should be record ed for subjects that are in a teduglutide treatment cy cle within 1 week of implementing a change in the PS prescription, regardless of previous teduglutide exposure.

Each PedsQL age-appropriate form takes le ss than 4 minutes to complete. The scales include self -reports for pediatric subjects and adolescents aged 5 to 18years and prox y-reports from parents of pediatri c subjects aged 2 to 18 years. The PedsQL Generic Core Scales will not be performed for subject s younger than 2 y ears of age. If a child is unable to complete the age -appropriate questionna ire (eg, due to developmental delay or other illness) it will not constitute a protocol deviation, but the parent should continue to complete the appropriate parent -specific forms. Field trials have shown that the internal consistency reliability of the Pe dsQL was excellent, with alphas for the generic core scales in both self -and proxy -report greater than the 0.70 standard, and alphas for the full 23 -item scale approaching 0.90 for self -and prox y-report. Missing data were minimal. Item response distribut ions were across the full- scale range, with no floor effects, and minimal ceiling effects. The validity of the PedsQL Generic Core Scales was demonstrated through known group comparisons, and correlations with other measures of disease burden. The PedsQL self-and proxy-report distinguished between pediatric subjects with and without a chronic health condition, and within the group of pediatric subjects with a chronic condition, between those who did or did not have an overnight hospital visit in the last 12 months. Further, both child self-report and parent proxy -report correlated significantly with the number of day s the child was too ill to pursue normal activities, needed someone to care for him or her, missed school in the last month, the number of day s the parent missed from work in the last month, and parent- report of problems pursuing their normal work routine and concentrating at work. The PedsQL Generic Core Scales are also responsive to clinical change, as demonstrated in field trials. 7.2.12.1 Pediatric Q uality of Life Generic Core Scale (PedsQL™), Acute V ersion The PedsQL Generic Core Scale is designed to measures health -related quality of life (HRQoL) in pediatric subjects and adolescents (2 -18 years of age).

The Child and Parent Reports of the PedsQL Generic Core Scale for Young Pediatric subjects (ages 5 -7), Pediatric subjects (ages 8- 12), and Teens (ages 13 -18) are composed of 23 items comprising 4 dimensions as follows: 1) Physical Functioning (8 items), 2) Emotional Functioning (5 items), 3) Social Functioning (5 items), 4) School Functioning (5 items). 7.2.12.2 Pediatric Quality of Life Family Impact Module (PedsQL™), Acute Version The PedsQL Family Impact Module is a parent -report multidimensional instrument that will be completed b y the parent or legal guardian, as outlined in Table 1-1, Table 1 -2, and Table 1 - 3. The PedsQL Family Impact Module is a specific module of the PedsQL that is used to measure the impact of pediatric chronic health conditions on parents and the family (Varni et al., 2004). The 36- item PedsQL Family Impact Modul e consists of 6 scales measuring parent self- reported functioning as follows: 1) Physical Functioning (6 items), 2) Emotional Functioning (5 items), 3) Social Functioning (4 items), 4) Cognitive Functioning (5 items; worries about treatment and disease), 5) Communication (3 items), 6) Worry (5items). Two additional scales measure parent -reported family functioning as follows: 1) Daily Activities (3 items), and 2) Family Relationships (5 items). The PedsQL Family Impact Module should take the parent or lega l guardian approximately 5 to 10 minutes to complete. 7.2.12.3 PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptoms Module (PedsQL™), Acute Version The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Sy mptom Module is a disease -specific 58- item module, comprised of 10 different s ymptom scales that assess gastrointestinal sy mptom -related quality of life: food and drink limits, trouble swallowing, heartburn and reflux, nausea and vomiting, gas and bloating, constipation, blood in poop, and diarrhea. The PedsQL Gastrointestinal Sy mptoms Module was designed to allow the selection and scoring of individual scales from the Module. The scales of Food and Drink L imits (6 items) and Diarrhea (7 items) were identified as clinically relevant and appropriate for the s ymptoms experienced in this pediatric study populati on, and therefore, are the onl yscales used in this study .

In addition, the interviews with caregivers will elicit concepts on aspects of caregiver burden associated with caring for their children with SBS and the impact of teduglutide on the caregiver burden experienced during th e stud y. The interviews will be offered to English -speaking parents or legal guardians of subjects and subjects aged 12 years or older in selected countries. At the qualified subjects’ clinic sites, subjects and caregivers will be provided with a descript ion of the qualitative interview and be offered the opportunit y to participate. Subjects and caregivers who agree to participate will be asked to provide written informed consent (for caregiver interviews) and written assent and parental permission (for subject interviews) using forms developed specifically for the interviews. The format will be a single individual telephone interview using a semistructured interview guide. Each interview will be approximately 45 minutes and will be completed within 14 day s after completion of the EOS/ET visit. Subjects and caregivers will be interviewed individually and separatel y and will be instructed to take the interview at a private setting. Two interview guides have been developed, one for the caregiver interviews ( Appendix 3 ) and one for the subject interviews ( Appendix 4 ). Interview guides for UK sites will be reviewed b y a native speaker of the local dialect. The guides will begin with a brief overview of the interview process and very general questions intended to get the participants talking about their experiences (and the impacts of these experiences) associated with SBS prior to entering the study . These questions will then be followed by a thorough probi ng of subject and caregiver experience during the study and the importa nce of the treatment outcomes. Topics included in the interview are listed below: Subjects: SBS- related s ymptoms and impacts oSymptoms due to SBS oSymptoms due to parenteral support oImpact of SBS on dail y activities, physical functioning and social functioning oImpact of parenteral support on daily activities, phy sical functioning, and social functioning For non-commercial use only"

An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product (ICH Guidance E2A 1995). All AEs are collected from the time the informed consent is signed until the 4 weeks following the last dose of teduglutide in the study . This includes events occurring during the screening phase of the stud y and the qualitative interviews, regardless of whether or not investi gational product is administered. Where possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of s ymptoms should be recorded. If a diagnosis has not been made, then each s ymptom should be listed individually . All AEs should be captured on the appropriate AE pages in th e eCRF and in source documents. In addition to untoward AEs, unexpected benefits outside the investigational product indication should also be captured on the AE eCRF. All AEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline status or all variables have returned to normal), regardless of whether the subject is still participating in the study . Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved (the investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event), or the event is otherwise explained. When appropriate, medical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of event(s) can be documented. 8.1.1 Severity Categorization The severit y of AEs must be recorded during the course of the event including the start and stop dates for each change in severity. An event that changes in severity should be captured as a new event. Worsening of pretreatment events, after initiation of investigational product, must be recorded as new AEs ( for example, if a subject experiences mild intermittent dy spepsia prior to dosing of investigational product, but the dy spepsia becomes severe and more frequent after first dose of investigational product has been administered, a new AE of severe dy spepsia [with the appropriate date of onset] is recorded on the appropriate eCRF). The medical assessment of severit y is determined by using the following definitions: Mild: A ty pe of AE that is usually transient and may require onl y minimal treatment or therape uticintervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living. Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject. For non-commercial use only"
376,page_376,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 60 SHP633 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 Teduglutide 01Oct2019 Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of dail y living, or significantly affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention. In consideration of whether a treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) might lead to dose interruption (Section 8.4.1) or early termination of the study (Section 8.5), severe TEAEs will also be graded according to the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Common Te rminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) severit y grading criteria ( US Department of Health and Human Services et al., 20 10). 8.1.2 Relationship Categorization A phy sician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused b y the investigational product. If there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not related”. Otherwise, if there is an y valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspect ing a possible cause -and-effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related”. The causality assessment must be documented in the source document. The following additional guidance may be helpful: Term Relationship Definition RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or suspected response pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained by the subject’s medical condition, other therapies, or accident. Not RelatedThe event can be readil y explained by other factors such as the subject’s underl ying medical condition, concomitant therapy , or accident and no plausible temporal or biologic relationship exists between the investigational product and the event. AEs that are related to study drug that are not resolved at EOT will be followed until the event resolves or stabilizes, as judged b y the investigator. Laboratory values, vital signs, and clinical findings at the scheduled ph ysical examinations must be reported as AEs if the investigator considers the finding to be a clinicall y significant change from the baseline.

377,page_377,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 61 SHP633 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 Teduglutide 01Oct2019 8.1.3 Outcome Categorization The outcome of AEs must be recorded during the course of the stud y in the eCRF. Outcomes are as follows: Fatal Not Recovered/Not Resolved Recovered/Resolved Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae Recovering/Resolving Unknown 8.1.4 Symptoms of the Disease under Study Symptoms of the disease under study should not be classed as AEs as long as they are within the normal day -to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease and are part of the efficacy data to be collected in the study; however, significant worsening of the s ymptoms should be recorded as an AE. 8.1.5 Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Evaluations A change in the value of a clinical laboratory or vital sign can represent an AE if the change is clinically relevant or if, during the study , a shift of a parameter is observed from a normal value to an abnormal value, or a further worsening of an alread y abnormal value. When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the reference range, the duration until return to the reference range, either while continuing treatment or after the end of treatment with the investigational product, and the range of variation of the respective parameter within its reference range, must be taken into consideration. If, during the stud y, there are abnormal clinical laboratory values or vital s igns which were not present at the beginning of the study , further investigations should be performed until the values return to within the reference range or until a plausible explanation (eg, concomitant disease) is found for the abnormal values. The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory or vital sign is clinicall y significant and therefore represents an AE. 8.1.6 Pregnancy All pregnancies are to be reported fro m the time informed consent is signed until the defined follow -up period stated in Section 7.1.4.

In the event a subject becomes pregnant during the study , teduglutide administration must be discontinued immediately. Every effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy outcome and condition of the infant. It is the responsibility of the investigator to obtain this information within 30 calendar day s after the initial notification and approximately 30 calendar day s postpartum. Pregnancy complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clinical Study Adverse Event Form for Serious Adverse Events and Non- serious AEs as Required b y the Protocol. Note: An elective abortion is not considered an SA E. In addition to the above, if the investigator determines that the pregnancy meets serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE using the Shire Clinical Study Adverse Event Form for SAEs and Non-serious AEs as Required by the Protocol as well as the S hire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form.

Note: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply to reports of abuse, misuse , overdose, or medication errors unless these result in an SAE. The categories below are not mutually exclusive; the event can meet more than 1 category . Abuse –Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of investigational product when used for a non -medi cal purpose (eg, to alter one’s state of consciousness or get high) in a manner that may be detrimental to the individual and/or society . Misuse –Intentional use of investigational product other than as directed or indicated at any dose (Note: this includes a situation where the investigational product is not used as directed at the dose prescribed by the protocol). Overdose –Administration of the investigational product at a dose or frequency greater than 0.05 mg/kg subcutaneous once dail y. An overdose occurs if an y of the following criteria are met: oMore than 0.05 mg/kg is given at an y one time oConsecutive doses are space d less than 12 hours apart oAny more than 0.05 mg/kg given in one day (a day is defined as beginning at 12:00 AMand ending at 11:59 PM) For non-commercial use only"

Medication errors should be collected/reported for all pro ducts under investigation. The administration and/or use of an expired investigational product should be considered as a reportable medication error. All investigational product provided to pediatric subjects should be supervised by the parent/legall y-authorized representative/caregiver. 8.2 Serious Adverse Event Procedures 8.2.1 Reference Safety Information The reference for safet y information for this study is the investigator brochure which the sponsor has provided under separate cover to all investigators. 8.2.2 Repor ting Procedures All initial and follow -up SAE reports must be reported by the investigator to the Shire Global Drug Safet y Department andthe S ponsor Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. Note: The 24- hour reporting requireme nt for SAEs does not apply to reports of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors (see Section 8.1.7) unless they result in an SAE. All Adverse Events of Special Interest, as defined in Section 8.3, must be reported by the investigator to the Shire Gl obal Drug Safet y Department and the S ponsor Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event even if the event does not fulfill seriousness criterion. The investigator must complete, sign, and date the Shire Clinical Study Adverse Event Form for SAEs and Non- serious AEs as Required b y Protocol and verify the accuracy of the information recorded on the form with the corresponding source documents (Note: Source documents are not to be sent unless requested). Fax or e -mail the completed form to the Shire Global Drug Safet y Department. A cop y of the completed Shire Clinical Study Adverse Event Form for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Non -serious AEs as Required b y Protocol (and any applicable follow -up reports) must also be sent to the Sponsor medical monitor or designee using the details specified in the emergency contact information section of the protocol. 8.2.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition Aserious adverse event ( SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be related to investigational product or not) that at any dose: Results in death For non-commercial use only"
380,page_380,"Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 64 SHP633 -304 Protocol Am endment 4 Teduglutide 01Oct2019 Is life -threatening. Note: The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of ""serious"" refers to an event in which t he subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. Note: Hospitalizatio ns, which are the result of elective or previousl y scheduled surgery for pre-existing conditions, which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not be classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a previously scheduled ventral hernia r epair would not be classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from a hospitalization for an elective or previously scheduled surgery that meet(s) serious criteria must be reported as SAE(s). Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity Is a congenital abnormality /birth defect Is an important medical event. Note: I mportant medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgm ent, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.2.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study ) are collected from the time the subject signs the informed consent until the defined follow- up period stated in Section 7.1.4, and must be reported to the Shire Global Drug Safety Department andthe S ponsor Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. In addition, any SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by the investigator at an y interval after the study has completed must be reported to the Shire Global Drug Safet y Department within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. 8.2.5 Serious Adverse Event Onset and Resolution Dates The onset date of the SAE is defined as the date the event meets serious criteria. The resolution date is the date the event no longer meets serious criteria, the date the s ymptoms re solve, or the event is considered chronic. I n the case of hospitalizations, the hospital admission and discharge dates are considered the onset and resolution dates, respectivel y. In addition, any signs or sy mptoms experienced by the subject after signing the informed consent form, or leading up to the onset date of the SAE, or following the resolution date of the SAE, must be recorded as an AE, if appropriate.

For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, wi thout a resolution date recorded. For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless another investigational product action was previously taken (eg, drug interrupted, reduced, withdrawn), the action taken wi th the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not changed” or “not applicable” (if the subject never received investigational product). The investigational product action of “withdrawn” should not be selected solel y as a result of the subject’ s death. 8.2.7 Regulatory Agency, Institutional Review Board, Ethics Committee, and Site Reporting The Sponsor and/or Clinical Contract Research Organization (CRO) is responsible for notify ing the relevant regulatory authorities, and US central I nstitutional R eview Boards (IRBs)/EU central ethics committees (ECs), of related, unexpected SAEs. In addition, the Clinical CRO is responsible for notify ing active sites of all related, unexpected SAEs occurring during all interventional studies across the SHP633 progr am. The investigator is responsible for notifying the local IRB, local EC, or the relevant local regulatory authorit y of all SAEs that occur at his or her site as required. 8.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest An AE of special interest is an AE (serious or n onserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the sponsor’s product or program and for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the investigator to the sponsor is required. The AEs of special interest that require expedited regulat ory reporting include the following: Growth of pre -existing poly ps of the colon Benign neoplasia of the GI tract including the hepatobiliary system Tumor -promoting ability (eg, benign and/or malignant neoplasia of any kind, not limited to those of the GI or hepatobiliary system) For AEs of special interest, the sponsor must be informed within 24 hours of first awareness as per the SAE notification instructions described in Section 8.2.2 even if the event does not fulfill the seriousness criteria. 8.4 Dose Inte rruption of Individual Subjects The investigator is responsible for contacting the sponsor/designee when the subject’s teduglutide dosing r egimen is interrupted.

This does not include the presence of anti- teduglutide antibodies, mild injection site reactions or mild sy mptoms that according to the investigator d o not pose a significant risk to the subject. Confirmed DILI related to teduglutide (see Section 8.4.2) Any malignancy . 8.4.1 Dose Interruption Criteria Based on Adverse Event Severity and Relationship to Investigational Product The investigational product must be interrupted if the subject experienced an AE that is of severit y ≥Grade 3 per the NCI CTCAE and is reported as related to the investigational product. In consideration of whether a TEAE might lead to dose interruption, severe TEAEs will also be graded according to the NCI CTCAE severit y grading criteria ( US Department of Health and Human S ervices et al., 2010 ). All such TEAEs should be discussed with the S ponsor Medical Monitor or designee as soon as possible. The length of the dose interruption, and whether teduglutide administration resumes or is permanently discontinued, depends on th e clinical situation. For non-commercial use only"

International normalized ratio should be measured with this set of verification laboratory assessments and an inquiry should be made as to the presence of clinical s ymptoms consistent with new liver injury . The subject should be followed closel y to determine the trajectory of the laboratory abnormalities and to evaluate the cause of liver injury . This evaluation may include, as clinically indicated, consideration of sepsis, acute viral hepatitis (eg, hepatitis A immunoglobulin [IgM], hepatitis B surface anti gen, hepatitis C antibodies, cy tomegalovirus IgM, Epstein- Barr virus antibody panel), hepatobiliary obstruction (ultrasound), autoimmune hepatitis (anti-nuclear, anti -smooth muscle, anti -actin, or anti -liver kidney microsomal antibodies), intestinal failur e associated liver disease, cardiovascular causes such as ischemic hepatitis, and concomitant hepatotoxic treatments. Additional evaluations may be performed at the discretion of the investigator in consultation with the S ponsor medical monitor. Teduglutide administration must be permanentl y discontinued if DILI is confirmed and deemed related to stud y drug. 8.5 Early Termination of the Clinical Study The data monitoring committee (DMC) may recommend stopping the study if any of the following conditions are met: ≥2subjects develop the same event of CTCAE severity Grade 3 that is reported as related to the investigational product or 1subject develops an event of CTCAE severity Grade 4 that is reported as related to the investigational product.

A study monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring plan and review the eCRF data against the source data for completeness and accuracy. Discrepancies between source data and data entered in the eCRF will be addressed b y qualified site personnel. When a data discrepancy warrants correction, the correction will be made by authorized site personnel. Data collection procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit and/or at the investigator’s meeting. Unscheduled safet y follow up assessments ( including visits conducted after EOS) are not to be collected unless requested. 9.2 C linical Data Management Data are to be entered into a clinical database as specified in the CRO’s data management process. Quality control and data validation procedures are applied to ensure the validity and accuracy of the clinical database. Data are to be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requiring further clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring clarification are to be communicated to the site for resolution. Only authorized personnel will make corrections to the clinical database, and all corrections are documented in an auditable manner. 9.3 Statistical Analysis Process The study will be anal yzed by the sponsor or its agent. All statistical anal yses will be performed using SAS®(SAS Institute, Ca ry, NC, USA) version 9.3 or higher. The statistical anal ysis plan (SAP) will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the analysis of the efficacy and safet y data, as well as describe the approaches to be taken for summarizing other study inform ation such as subject disposition, demographics and baseline characteristics, investigational product exposure, and prior and concomitant medications. 9.4 Planned Interim Analysis, and Data Monitoring Committee An interim anal ysis is planned when 6 months of safet y data have been collected for subjects entering from TED -C14-006. Additional interim analy ses may be conducted as needed. A DMC will be involved in the management of this study . The DMC members will review the data approximately every 3 months according to the DMC Charter. The DMC review will include all cumulative safety data (ie, AEs, laboratory assessments, phy sical examinations, etc.) from study assessments through each cutoff period. Further details regarding the DMC can be found in the DMC char ter, which will be available prior to the administration of investigational product. For non-commercial use only"

The DMC will be an external, independent board comprised of ph ysicians with relevant training. The DMC will be restricted to individuals free of significant conflicts of interest, including, but not limited to, financial, scientific, or regulatory in nature. The DMC will be governed by a Charter agreed to b y members of the Board and the sponsor. Members of the Board may not be study investigators or be employ ed at the same institution as a study investigator, individuals employ ed by the sponsor, independent contractors hired by the sponsor, or members of regulatory agencies. The DMC may make recommendations to the sponsor regarding stud y aspects including stopping, modify ing or continuing the study ; however, the sponsor will have the final responsibility to determine whether the study should be modified or temporaril y or permanentl y stopped. 9.5 Sample Size Calculation and Power Considerations The number of subjects in this study is not based on statistical power considerations as this is an extension study of the core studies, TED -C14-006 and SHP633- 301. The maximum number of subjects was determined by the enrollment in TED -C14-006 and SHP633 -301. 9.6 Study Population The safet y population includes all enrolled subjects in the study . Safet y population will be used for both safet y and efficacy anal yses. 9.7 Efficacy Analyses No claims of statistical significance will be made; however, 95% confidence intervals will be provided, if applicable. Continuous variables, including those assessed on a disc rete scale, will be summarized using descriptive statistics including number of subjects, mean, median, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum. For categorical variables, statistical summaries will include number of subjects and percentages. 9.7.1 Efficacy End points Efficacy endpoints will be anal yzed at the end of each teduglutide treatment period (week 24 or EOT), and at each stud y visit, relative to the baseline of the core study (TED -C14-006 or SHP633 -301) and/or first exposure to teduglutide. The following effica cy endpoints will be analyzed: Reduction in PS volume of at least 20% Absolute and relative change in PS volume Complete weaning off PS Change in day s per week of PS For non-commercial use only"

The number of events, incidence, and percentage of AEs will be calculated overall, by System Organ Class (SOC) and by preferred term. SAEs will be further summarized by severit y and relationship to investigational product. Adverse events related to investigation al product, AEs leading to withdrawal, SAEs, and deaths will be similarly summarized/listed. Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization- Drug Dictionary (WHO -DD) with regard to drug class and drug name. The number an d percentage of subjects with specific prior medications will be summarized. Medical history (including surgical/procedural history ) will be coded using MedDRA. The number and percentage of subjects with specific histories will be summarized by system orga n class and preferred term. For clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, body weight, and fluid balance variables, descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values, the number and percentage of subjects in specified cate gories) will be calculated to summarize the observed values and change from baseline at each scheduled visit. The number and percentage of subjects classified as having positive or neutralizing antibodies to teduglutide will be used to summarize the presen ce of antibodies. Additional safet y parameters and measures will include change in bod y weight, height (or length) and head circumference (up to 36 months of age). Derived variables will include height z -score, weight z -score, BMI, and BMI z -score.

The sponsor and/or its representatives accessing the records and data will take all reasonable precaut ions in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and guidelines to maintain the confidentiality of subjects’ identities. Subjects are assigned a unique identify ing number; however, their initials and date of birth may also be collected and used to ass ist the sponsor to verify the accuracy of the data (eg, to confirm that laboratory results have been assigned to the correct subject). The results of studies –containing subjects’ unique identify ing number, relevant medical records, and possibly initials and dates of birth –will be recorded. They may be transferred to, and used in, other countries which may not afford the same level of protection that applies w ithin the countries where this study is conducted. The purpose of an y such transfer would includ e: to support regulatory submissions, to conduct new data anal yses to publish or present the study results, or to answer questions asked by regulatory or health authorities. 10.5 Study Results / Publication Policy Shire will endeavor to publish the results of a ll qualify ing, applicable, and covered studies according to external guidelines in a timely manner regardless of whether the outcomes are perceived as positive, neutral, or negative. Additionally, Shire adheres to external guidelines (eg,Good Publication Practices 2) when forming a publication steering committee, which is done for large, multicenter Phase 2 -4 and certain other studies as determined by Shire. The purpose of the publication steering committee is to act as a non -commercial body that advises or decides on dissemination of scientific stud y data in accordance with the scope of this policy. All publications relating to Shire products or projects must undergo appropriate technical and intellectual propert y review, with Shire agreement to publish pr ior to release of information. The review is aimed at protecting the sponsor’s proprietary information existing either at the commencement of the study or generated during the study . To the extent permitted by the publisher and cop yright law, the principal investigator will own (or share with other authors) the copy right on his/her publications. To the extent that the principal investigator has such sole, joint or shared rights, the principal investigator grants the sponsor a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free license to make and distribute copies of such publications. The term “publication” refers to an y public disclosure including original research articles, review articles, oral presentations, abstracts and posters at medical congresses, journal supplem ents, letters to the editor, invited lectures, opinion pieces, book chapters, electronic postings on medical/scientific websites, or other disclosure of the study results, in printed, electronic, oral or other form.

Please consider the following clinical parameters identified as markers for adequate management of pediatric SBS. These parameters should also be considered f or managing nutritional support (PS and/or oral/enteral feeding) in terms of volume and calories during the treatment period. Growth trajectory , including weight, height (or length), and head circumference (for pediatric subjects up to 36 months of age) Other clinical evaluations Serum electrol ytes Blood urea nitrogen /creatinine levels Changes in stool frequency or volume, including mixed output Stool consistency (ie, Bristol Stool Scale) Urine specific gravit y General consideration to possible clinical deterioration in SBS Inability to maintain weight and growth velocity Diarrhea ( ≥10 bowel movements per day , ≥80 mL/kg/day from an ostomy, or ≥75mL/kg/day mixed output) Colic/vomiting frequency increased Electrol yte changes or imbalance Skin breakdown Adjustments should be based on the actual nutritional support in volume and calories the subject infuses. Subjects should remain compliant with the nutritional support prescription in volume and calories during the stud y. Nutritional support constituents may be adjusted at the discretion of the investigator. During the 48 -hour output measurement period prior to the subject’s scheduled visit, no further changes to the prescribed nutritional support should be made. If there is a change in EN or other food or fluid intake, the investigator should consider this when adjusting the PS/EN support in volume and calories.
