Protocol Num ber: M14 -431 Nam e of Study Drug: Upadacitinib (ABT -494) Phase of Developm ent: 3 Nam e of Active Ingredient: Upadacitinib (ABT -494)Date of Protocol Synopsis: 05March 2021 Protocol Title: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Induction Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Upadacitinib (ABT -494) in Subjects with Moderately to Severely Active Crohn's Disease Who Have Inadequately Responded to or are Intolerant to Biolog ic Therapy Objective: The objective of Study M14 -431 is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib compared to placebo as induction therapy in subjects w ith moderately and severely active Crohn's disease (CD). Investigators: Multicenter Study Site s: Approximately 400 sites w orldwide. Study Population: Males and females betw een 18 and 75 years of age (or minimum age of adult consent according to local regulations) with a confirmed diagnosis of CD for at least 3 months and moderately to severely active CD who have inadequately responded to or are intolerant to biologic therapy. Moderately to severely active CD is defined by: Average daily very soft or liquid stool frequency (SF) ≥ 4 AND/OR average daily abdominal pain (AP) score ≥ 2 (val ues represent the unweighted daily averages of the corresponding subscores from the Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI]); and Evidence of mucosal inflammation, defined as Simplified Endoscopic Score for CD (SES -CD) ≥6 (≥ 4 for subjects with isolated ile al disease), excluding the presence of narrowing component. Subjects must have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more biologic agents for CD (adalimumab, certolizumab, infliximab, ustekinumab and/or vedolizumab). The study will allow enrollment of up to35% of subjects who have demonstrated inade quate response or intolerance to 3 or more biologics. Number of Subjects to be Enrolled: Approximat ely625subjects w orldwide. Methodology: Study M14 -431 is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled induction study to evaluate the efficac y and safety of upadacitinib, an orally administered Janus kinase 1 inhibitor, in adult subjects with moderately to severely active CD who have inadequately responded to or are intolerant to biologic therapy. Subjects who consent and meet all of the inclus ion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria w ill be enrolled into this study, which encompasses 3 parts: (Part 1) a randomized, double -blind, placebo - controlled induction; (Part 2) an open -label, single -arm active induction; and (Part 3) an Extended Treatment Period for non -responders from Part 1 or Part 2."
6,page_6,"Upadacitinib (ABT -494) M14 -431 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2017 -001226 -18 7 Methodology (Continued): Study visits may be impacted due to the coronavirus disease –2019 ( COVID -19)pandemic or any state of emergency or pandemic situation. If visits cannot be conducted onsit e due to travel restrictions or other pandemic -related reasons, phone or virtual visits, visits at alternative locations, or changes in the visit frequency and timing of study procedures, among others may be performed. Additional details are provided in t he subsequent sections. Every effort should be made to ensure the safety of subjects and site staff, while maintaining the integrity of the study. Part 1 In Part 1, subjects (n = 495) will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to upadacitinib 45 mg once daily (QD) or matching placebo for 12 w eeks. The randomization will be stratified by baseline corticosteroid use (yes or no), endoscopic disease severity (SES -CD < 15 and ≥ 15), and number of prior biologic treatments (>1 and ≤ 1). The data collected from subject s from Part 1 will be used for the primary efficacy analysis. Visits during the study will occur at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12/Premature Discontinuation (PD) to collect clinical, endoscopic, and laboratory assessments of disease activity. At Week 12, subjects achieving clinical response, defined as ≥ 30% decrease in average daily very soft or liquid SF and/or ≥30% decrease in average daily AP score (both not w orse than Baseline) may be eligible to enter the 52 -week, double -blind, maintenance port ion of Study M14 -430. All subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12 w ill be able to enroll in Part 3 (Extended Treatment Period) and receive double- blind upadacitinib until Week 24/PD. Subjects are not eligible to enter Study M14 -430 until the ileocolonoscopy procedure at Week 12 has been completed. If the COVID -19 pandemic precludes a subject from undergoing an endoscopy, the subject can enroll in Study M14 -430 if clinical response was achieved at Week 12. Part 2 Part 2 is an open -label p ortion (open -label cohort) of this study. Once enrollment in Part 1 is complete, approximately 130subjects will be enrolled in Part 2 to receive open -label upadacitinib 45 mg QD for 12weeks. The objective of Part 2 is to have a sufficient number of sub jects with clinical response to be rerandomized in the double -blind, maintenance portion of Study M14 -430, while minimizing unnecessary exposure to placebo. The data collected from subjects from Part 2 w ill not be part of the primary efficacy analysis for this study, will use descriptive statistics, and will be reported separately in the clinical study report. Visits during the study will occur at Baseline and Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12/PD to collect clinical, endoscopic, and laboratory assessments of disease activity. At Week 12, subjects achieving clinical response may be eligible to enter Study M14 -430. Subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12 w ill be eligible to participate in Part 3 (Extended Treatment Period) to receive open -label upadacitinib 30 mg QD until Week 24/PD. Part 3 Part 3 is a 12 -week Extended Treatment Period consisting of 3 cohorts of subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12 in Part 1 or Part 2. The objectives of Part 3 are to offer blinded upadacitini b induction treatment to placebo non -responders from Part 1 and to evaluate delayed clinical response to upadacitinib in subjects who did not initially respond to upadacitinib during Part 1 or Part 2."

Subjects in Cohort 1 and 2 w ill remain blinded to treatment to avoid unmasking the treatment received durin g Part 1. The data collected from subjects from Part 3 will not be part of the primary efficacy analysis for this study, will use descriptive statistics, and will be reported separately in the clinical study report. Subjects are not eligible to enter in P art 3 until the Week 12 endoscopy has been completed. If the COVID -19 pandemic precludes a subject from undergoing an endoscopy, and the subject has not achieved clinical response, the subject can enter Part 3 of Study M14 -431. Visits will occur at Weeks 16, 20 and 24/PD to collect clinical, endoscopic, and laboratory assessments of disease activity. During Part 3, subjects with persistent symptoms or w orsening of CD may be discontinued at any time. At Week 24, subjects who achieve clinical response may be eligible to enter Study M14 -430. Subjects are not eligible to enter Study M14 -430 until the ileocolonoscopy procedure at Week 24 for evaluation of mucosal inflammation has been completed. If the COVID -19 pandemic precludes a subject from undergoing a n endoscopy, the subject can enroll in Study M14 -430 if clinical response was achieved at Week 24. Subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 24 will be discontinued from Study M14 -431 and will receive standard of care treatment at the investi gator's discretion. Subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 24 and all subjects who prematurely discontinue the study will have a follow -up visit 30 days from the last dose of study drug to collect information on new or ongoing adverse event s (AEs) and laboratory assessments. Subjects will be discontinued from the study if they withdraw consent or if they are deemed unsuitable to continue for any reason by the investigator. The duration of the study could be up to 33 w eeks, including Screeni ng Period (5 w eeks), a 12 -week double -blind or open -label cohort Induction Period (Part 1 and Part 2), a 12 -week Extended Treatment Period (Part 3), and a 30 -day follow -up for subjects who do not enroll into Study M14 -430. At the Screening Visit, all subje cts w ill be provided w ith an electronic diary. Subjects will be instructed and trained on how to record CD -related symptoms (including total and very soft and liquid number of stools and abdominal pain), general well -being and use of anti -diarrheals on a daily basis; and use of medications for endoscopy preparation throughout the study. The very soft and liquid stools are defined as consistency Type 6 or Type 7 based on the Bristol Stool Chart."
8,page_8,"Upadacitinib (ABT -494) M14 -431 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2017 -001226 -18 9 Methodology (Continued): The diary will be reviewed by site personnel with the subject at each visit and for the assessment of the clinical endpoints. At each Study Visit, routine physical examination including evaluation of vital signs, extra intestinal manifestations, and presence or absence of fistulas; calcul ation of CDAI score, average daily very soft or liquid SF and average daily AP (SF and AP entries from the most recent 7 -day period prior to each study visit will be used); monitoring of AEs; reporting of concomitant medications and laboratory assessments will be performed. The very soft or liquid SF and AP score values represent the unweighted daily averages of the corresponding subscores from the CDAI. Additionally, subjects w ill complete quality of life (QoL), CD symptoms, symptoms impact on QoL, and w ork productivity questionnaires throughout the study. Subjects will undergo a full colonoscopy (ileocolonoscopy) for evaluation of mucosal inflammation using the SES -CD. All endoscopies w ill be centrally read to document eligibility at Screening and for Week 12 and 24/PD assessments. Intestinal biopsies during the endoscopic evaluation will be collected for histologic assessment and exploratory research during endoscopy visits at Screening, Week 12, and Week 24/PD in approximately 200 subjects (intestina l biopsy substudy). Optional blood samples will be collected for exploratory research at Baseline, Week 4, Week 12, and Week 24/PD. Optional stool collections will be done at Baseline, Week 4 and Week 12 for exploratory evaluation of biomarkers in approxi mately 200 subjects (fecal biomarker substudy). Concom itant CD -Related Medications (Antibiotics, Aminosalicylates, and/or Methotrexate) All subjects receiving a stable dose of CD -related antibiotics, aminosalicylates, or methotrexate (MTX) at Baseline sho uld maintain their concomitant treatments without dose changes through the end of the study. Initiating and/or changing doses of these medications are prohibited during the study. Doses of CD-related antibiotics, aminosalicylates, or MTX may be decreased only in the event of safety or tolerability issues. Concom itant Corticosteroids Subjects who enter the study on oral corticosteroids are not allow ed to change the corticosteroid dose during the first 4 weeks of the induction treatment period. Dose may be decreased only for safety or tolerability issues. Initiating locally acting (rectal or suppository) or systemic corticosteroids is prohibited during the induction treatment period. At Week 4, subjects who are on prednisone (or oral equivalent) or oral bu desonide must have their corticosteroid dose tapered, according to the tapering schedule. Subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 12 in Part 1 or Part 2, and enter Part 3 w ithout having completed the steroid taper should resume the corticoste roid taper at Week 16, according to the tapering schedule."

This study will evaluate one indu ction dose of upadacitinib 45 mg QD. Efficacy analysis will be based on all intent -to-treat (ITT) subjects. The ITT analysis set includes all randomized subjects who have taken at least one dose of study drug in the double -blind induction period from Part 1. The comparison between treatment groups on the co -primary efficacy endpoints will be performed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test and will be stratified by Baseline corticosteroid use (yes or no), endoscopic disease severity (SES -CD < 15 and ≥ 15), and number of prior biologics used (> 1 and ≤1). Both of the co -prim ary efficacy endpoints will be tested at tw o-sided significance level of 0.05. A CMH -based, tw o-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference betw een treatment groups w ill be calculated. If the average daily SF or average daily AP score (EU/EMA) or CDAI (US/FDA) data at Week 12 are missing, the non -responder imputation approach will be applied for the clinical remission per PROs and clinical remission per CDAI endpoints, respectively. Subjects who discontinue prior to Week 12 for any reason will be considered as ""not -achieved"" for clinical remission or endoscopic response endpoints. A multiple testing procedure will be used to provide strong control of the type 1 error rate at alpha =0.05 (2 -sided) across analyses with respect to the co -prim ary endpoints, and ranked secondary endpoints. Specifically, testing will utilize a sequence of hypothesis testing for the co -primary endpoints followed by the ranked secondary endpoints, and will begin with testing co -primary endpoints using α of 0.05 (2 -sided). If both co -primary endpoints achieve statistical significance, continued testing will follow a pre -specified w eight of α allocation between individual hypotheses as well as betwee n families of hypotheses. The details of the testing procedure w ill be specified and documented in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). In general, continuous secondary efficacy variables with repeated measurements will be analyzed using a Mixed Effect Re peated Measure (MMRM) model. Continuous secondary efficacy variables which are collected at only one post -baseline visit (such as SES -CD) will be analyzed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model. Categorical secondary efficacy variables will be an alyzed using the CMH test controlling for stratification variables. NRI for missing data will be used for categorical secondary endpoints. The extent of missing data due to COVID -19 will be monitored and appropriate analysis to handle these missing data may be performed; details w ill be included in the SAP. Further details of the statistical analysis will be described and documented in the SAP."

24,page_24,"Upadacitinib (ABT -494) M14 -431 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2017 -001226 -18 25 3.0 Introduction Crohn's disease (CD) encompasses a spectrum of clinical and pathological processes manifested b y focal as ymmetric, transmural, and occasionall y granulomatous inflammation that can affect an y segment of the gastrointestinal tract.1 The disease can affect persons of an y age, and its onset is most common in the second and third decades. Females are affecte d slightly more than males, and the risk for disease is higher in some ethnic groups.2,3 In North America, the incidence of CD is estimated to be 3.1 to 14.6 cases per 100,000 persons. Prevalence rates range from 26 to 99 cases per 100,000 persons. In Europe, CD has an incidence of 0.7 to 9.8 cases per 100,000 persons and a prevalence rate of 8.3 to 214 cases per 100,000 persons.2 CD has been characterized by significant morbidity includi ng abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss/malnutrition, a progressive nature that leads to complications such as fistulas, strictures and abscesses. Given that no known medical or surgical cure currently exists for CD, the therapeutic strategy is to reduc e symptoms, improve quality of life (QoL), reduce endoscopic evidence of inflammation, and minimize short- and long -term toxicity and complications.3 Currently , patients with moderate to severe disease who have failed aminosalicy lates or topical treatments are usually treated with conventional pharmacologic interventions, which include corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine (AZA), 6-mercaptopurine (6 -MP), or methotrexate (MTX).1,4 Local or s ystemic corticosteroids may be used for induction of remission, but are not recommended as maintenance therap y, due to their side effect profile.5,6 Immunosuppressants are recommended for use as maintenance therap y; however, not all patients have a clinicall y meaningful response or a susta ined response to these therapies. Patients who do not respond to conventional therapies may be treated with biologics, such as anti -tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α therapies.1,4 However, approximately 40% of patients do not respond to their first biologic therap y (primary non -responders).7-11 Among patients who initially respond and continue to receive maintenance treatment for longer durations, approximately 38%"
25,page_25,"Upadacitinib (ABT -494) M14 -431 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2017 -001226 -18 26 become non- responders after 6 months and approximately 50% become non -responders at 1 year (secondary non-responders).8,10 Patients who initially respond to a first anti -TNF agent but then lose response tend to have lower response and remission rates to the second anti-TNF agent or other biologic therapies.10,12 Vedolizumab, an anti -integrin biologic, is associated with a relatively slower onset of action and the majority of subjects in the Phase 3 clinical induction (85%) and maintenance (68.6%) trials did not achieve remission. Furthermore, vedolizumab treatment has not been associated with reduction of systemic signs of inflammation (such as C -reactive protein [CRP]).13 More recentl y, ustekinumab, which targets the p40 subunit shared by interleukin (IL) -23 and IL -12, demonstrated efficacy in three Phase 3 studies (UNITI -1, UNITI -2,14and IM -UNITI15) in subjects with CD. I n UNITI -1 and UNITI -2, clinical remission rates at Week 8 were 20.9% and 40.2%, respectively , compared with placebo (7.3% and 19.6%, respectivel y). After maintenance treatment, 53.1% of patients receivin g ustekinumab achieved clinical remission, versus 35.9% of patients receiving placebo at Week 44. The available treatment options may also be associated with some adverse events (AEs) that may limit the use or require close monitoring. Therefore, there r emains a medical need for additional therapeutic options in CD for patients with inadequate response to or intolerance to conventional therapies and anti- TNF α agents. Rationale for Development of a JAK Inhibitor in CD Inhibition of Janus kinase (JAK) -medi ated pathway s is a promising approach for the treatment of patients with CD.16 The JAK family is com posed of 4 famil y members: JAK1, 2, 3, and Ty rosine kinase 2. These cy toplasmic kinases are associated with membrane cy tokine receptors such as common gamma -chain (CGC) receptors and the glycoprotein 130 (gp130) transmembrane proteins.17 Activation of JAK pathway s initiates expression of survival factors, cy tokines, chemokines, and other molecules that facilitate leukocy te cellular trafficking and cell proliferation which contribute to inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.18 In CD, the imbalance between anti -inflammatory and pro -inflammatory cytokines in the mucosal immune sy stem is thought to play an important role. Cells from the innate"
26,page_26,"Upadacitinib (ABT -494) M14 -431 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2017 -001226 -18 27 mucosal immune sy stem, i.e., TH1 or TH17, are over -activated and secrete various pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon gamma (INF -g), TNFα, IL-6, IL -1b, IL -12, IL-23. These cy tokines signal via JAK pathway s.19 JAK3 and JAK1 are components of the CGC cy tokine receptor complexes and blockade of either inhibits signaling b y the inflammatory cytokines IL -2, -4, -7, -9, -15 and - 21.20 Cytokines such as IL -6 bind to gp130 and transduce its signal predominantly via JAK1.21 Targeting the IL -6 receptor (IL -6R) is a promising approach given the fact that expression of IL -6 and soluble IL -6 receptors is elevated in patients with active CD.22 Thus, inhibition of JAK1 is expected to attenuate the signaling of IL -6 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IFN -g), that are involved in development of CD. Tofacitinib, a pan- JAK inhibitor approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), failed to demonstrate the efficacy in two Phase 2 studies in CD.23 Filgotinib, a second generation JAK inhibitor, selective for JAK1, induced clinical remission in significantly more patients with active CD compared with placebo, however, did not demonstrate endoscopic improvement after a 10 -week induction period.24 JAK inhibitors have been associated with infections, including herpes zoster reactivation, malignancies, and as ymptomatic, mild and reversible changes in levels of hemoglobin, lymphocy te counts, white blood cell (WBC) counts, serum creatinine, total cholesterol, high densit y lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C) and liver transaminases (alanine transaminase [AL T], aspartate transaminase [AST]) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK).24,25 Upadacitinib is a novel selective JAK1 inhibitor being developed for the treatment of adult patients with CD. In an in vitro setting, upadacitinib potently inhibits JAK1 activity , but to a lesser degree, inhib its the other isoforms, JAK2 and JAK3. The enhanced selectivity of upadacitinib against JAK1 may offer an improved benefit -risk profile in patients with CD. The clinical hypothesis is that upadacitinib should be effective in decreasing inflammation and damage associated with CD by interfering with JAK1 - mediated signaling pathway s (i.e., IL -6) without causing excessive anemia due to its"
27,page_27,"Upadacitinib (ABT -494) M14 -431 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2017 -001226 -18 28 reduced activity against JAK2 (half maximal inhibitory concentration [I C50] 120 nM), which is essential for erythropoieti n signaling. Upadacitinib is also less potent against JAK3 (I C502.3 µM), an important component of lymphocyte activation and function. As such, treatment with upadacitinib, a selective JAK1 inhibitor with reduced JAK3 inhibition, could result in a decre ased risk for infection (including viral reactivation) and/or malignancy compared to less selective JAK inhibitors. Additional information regarding the preclinical toxicology, metabolism, pharmacology, safet y experience and indications under study with up adacitinib can be found in the current edition of the Investigator's Brochure.26 Upadacitinib has been evaluated in Phase 2 dose ranging placebo- controlled studies in subjects with moderatel y to severel y active CD (Study M13 -740; NCT02365649) and moderatel y to severel y active RA (Study M13 -537; NCT02066389 and Study M13 -550; NCT01960855). The 52 -week data in subjects with CD from Study M13 -740 suggest that upadacitinib may alleviate signs and s ymptoms of active CD and reduce mucosal inflammation. In Stud y M13 -740, 220 subjects were randomized to 4 twice daily (BID), 1 once dail y (QD) dose regimens of u padacitinib immediate release capsules (3 mg BID, 6 mg BID, 12mg BID, 24 mg BID, and 24 mg QD), or to placebo. As induction treatment, a statistically significant dose -response relationship was observed with upadacitinib for the co-primary endpoint of en doscopic remission. A dose -response was not observed for the clinical remission co- primary endpoint; however, a new endpoint for potential use as primary in Phase 3 demonstrated a statistically significant dose -response relationship for clinical remission in the 6 mg BID and 24 mg BID dose groups compared to placebo. Endoscopic response was statistically significantly better in all upadacitinib dose groups except for 3 mg BID compared to placebo. In the Extension Phase, subjects who achieved response and were re -randomized to the 12 mg BID group achieved statistically significant clinical remission and endoscopic outcomes compared to subjects in the 3 mg BID group at Week 52."
28,page_28,"Upadacitinib (ABT -494) M14 -431 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2017 -001226 -18 29 Safety data from the induction portion of Study M13 -740 were consistent with the profile observed in the Phase 3 RA studies. The incidences of AEs in Study M13 -740 were numericall y higher in the upadacitinib dose groups, with no dose relationship. I nfections occurred with higher incidences in the upadacitinib groups than the placebo group, but also did not show dose -related increases. The most frequentl y reported AEs ( ≥ 5%) in the upadacitinib treated subjects were headache, Crohn's disease, abdominal pain, fatigue, nasopharyngitis, urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract i nfection, vomiting and pyrexia. Upadacitinib continued to be generally well tolerated following re - randomization of subjects at Week 16 to upadacitinib 3 mg BID, 6 mg BID, 12 mg BID, or 24 mg QD through Week 52 of the Extension Phase. There were 5 subjec ts with non- serious events of herpes zoster reactivation. Two events of gastrointestinal perforation were reported in 2 subjects; 1 subject had worsening of CD and associated fistulization and abscess, and the other subject had a perforation in an area of fissuring ulcer. Similar to the RA Phase 3 studies, increase in LDL -C and HDL -C, reductions in natural killer (NK) cells, slight decreases in red blood cell (RBC) counts, and as ymptomatic and transient CPK elevations were observed. No deaths were report ed during the study . All subjects who complete Study M13 -740 are eligible to enroll in Study M14 -327, a Phase 2, open -label extension study to evaluate the long -term safet y and efficacy of upadacitinib. Study M14 -431 will evaluate one induction dose of upa dacitinib (45 mg QD) of the once - daily modified -release tablet formulation. The selection of this dose was informed b y the analysis of the 16 -week safet y, efficacy, and exposure -response Phase 2 data from Study M13 -740. In addition, all the currentl y ava ilable pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacod ynamic, safety, and efficacy data from upadacitinib studies were used to support the selection of this dose. Upadacitinib 45 mg QD, dosed for up to 12 weeks, is expected to be efficacious with an acceptable safety pro file, and upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD, dosed for up to 240 weeks as maintenance treatment, are expected to be efficacious with acceptable safet y profiles."

This is supported by post -hoc anal yses of the adalimumab studies, the Phase 2 risankizumab Study 1311.6 and upadacitinib Study M13-740, where the proposed inclusion criterion of very soft/liquid stool frequency and abdominal pain score was met b y 85% to 92% of subjects with baseline CDAI 220 to 450, respectivel y. 3.1 Differences Statement This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of upadacitinib 45 mg QD versus placebo in subjects with moderatel y to severely active CD. The primary difference between Stud y M14 -431 and the prior Phase 2 study of upadacitinib in CD is that this study will test a QD oral formulation of upad acitinib and confirm the efficacy of upadacitinib in a larger CD population with inadequate response or intolerance to biologic therapies. Additionall y, some efficacy endpoint definitions in this study are different from Phase 2 to reflect the changing re gulatory requirements for pivotal registrational studies for new agents for the treatment of CD. 3.2 Benefits and Risks Although conventional and newer treatments such as biologic therapies have improved the standard of care for patients with CD, there remains a significant unmet medical need for patients with inadequate or loss of response to these agents, and efforts are ongoing to develop novel therapies.

Adverse events (AEs) such as infections, herpes zoster reactivation, malignancies, and hematologic AEs have been observed with JAK inhibition. By its selectivity for JAK1, upadacitinib may be able to decrease inflammation mediated b y JAK1 signaling while having less inhibitory effect on JAK2 and JAK3. This could potentially minimize some of the reported safety concerns with less selective JAK inhibition which are thought to be mediated b y inhibition of JAK2 and JAK3 signaling pathways. The available long -term safety data from the Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis (RA ) studies with upadacitinib did not show an y new significant safet y concerns compared to the marketed JAK inhibitors. The findings of an increased risk of infections, herpes zoster, and abnormal laboratory changes have been observed (e.g., elevations of s erum transaminases, lipids, creatine phosphokinase, and reductions in hemoglobin and white blood cells) with upadacitinib therapy. The incidence rates of other clinically important adverse events such as cardiovascular events, malignancies and mortality r eported during the RA studies were within the expected range for the general population or for a population of patients with moderatel y to severel y active RA. Events of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors including upadacitinib. In addition, no new safety signals have been identified in the Phase 2 (Study M13 -740; NCT02365649) study of moderately to severel y active CD with upadacitinib during 52 weeks of treatment. The results of g enetic toxicology testing indicate that upadacitinib is not genotoxic; however, upadacitinib is teratogenic based on animal studies, which necessitates avoidance of pregnancy in females of childbearing potential. Based on the calculated safet y margins for human fetal exposure with seminal fluid transfer, there is judged to be no risk to the pregnancy of female partners of male subjects who are treated with upadacitinib."

Taken together, the safety and efficacy data from upadacitinib studies to date show a favorable benefit:risk profile for upadacitinib and support the conti nued investigation of upadacitinib in patients with various autoimmune/inflammatory conditions. AbbVie is conducting a Phase 3 study in subjects with CD based on the following supportive findings: 1) demonstrated clinical and endoscopic improvements in th e induction treatment in a Phase 2 dose -ranging study ; and 2) safety results were consistent with those known to be associated with JAK inhibition. The current Phase 3 Study M14 -431 will further evaluate the benefit to risk profile of upadacitinib in CD subjects who have inadequately responded to, or are intolerant to, biologic therapies. In view of the coronavirus (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit:risk profile of various immunomodulatory therapies on COVID -19 is being evaluated. At this time, the effects of upadacitinib on the course of COVID -19 are not well defined. 4.0 Study Objective The objective of Stud y M14 -431 is to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of upadacitinib compared to placebo as induction therap y in subjects with moderatel y and severel y active CD. 5.0 Investigational Plan 5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description Study M14 -431 is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled induction study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of upadacitinib, an orally administered JAK1 inhibitor in adult subjects with moderatel y to severely active CD who have inadequatel y responded to or are intolerant to biologic therap y.

At screening, all subjects will be assessed for evidence of increased risk for TB b y a risk factor assessment form ( Appendix D) and tested for TB infection b y QuantiFERON -TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent such as T -SPOT TB test). The PPD Skin Test (also known as a TB Skin Test or Mantoux Test) should be utilized only when a QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test is not possible for an y reason (unless both tes ts are required per local guidelines). The site staff will complete the TB risk assessment form and enter the data into an appropriate eCRF. If a subject had a negative QuantiFERON -TB Gold (and/or PPD) test within 90 day s prior to Screening and source documentation is available, the test does not need to be repeated, provided nothing has changed in the subject's medical history to warrant a repeat test. These cases may be discussed with the AbbVie TA MD. The results of the TB test(s) will be retained at the site as the original source documentation. Subjects with documentation of a prior positive result of QuantiFERON- TB Gold Test (or equivalent) or PPD may not repeat either test at Screening or during the study and should be considered positive. TB Test For regions that require both PPD and QuantiFERON -TB Gold testing, both will be performed. A positive TB test is defined b y local guidelines (for example, in some countries, both PPD and QuantiFERON -TB Gold are performed, and if either one is positive, t he TB test is considered positive)."
61,page_61,"Upadacitinib (ABT -494) M14 -431 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2017 -001226 -18 62 In the absence of local guidelines defining a positive result when both PPD and QuantiFERON- TB Gold tests are performed, the TB test is considered positive if either one is positive. If a site has the capacit y to perform both PPD and QuantiFERON- TB Gold tests, and local guidelines require onl y one test to be performed, then the QuantiFERON -TB Gold is the preferred test. If onl y a PPD is placed at screening, then the PPD will be the reference TB test to be used for the re mainder of the program for that subject. Similarly, if a subject enters the stud y with a QuantiFERON -TB Gold test alone or other IGRA (negative result), then an y future TB test performed should be a QuantiFERON -TB Gold test. If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test is NOT possible (or if both the QuantiFERON -TB Gold Test and the PPD are required per local guidelines): the PPD will be performed according to standard clinical practice. The TB Skin Test should be read by a licensed healthcare professional between 48 and 72 hours after administration. A subject who does not return within 72 hours will need to be rescheduled for another skin test. The reaction will be measured in millimeters (mm) of induration and induration ≥ 5 mm is considered a positive reaction. The absence of induration will be recorded as ""0 mm"" not ""negative."" Subjects who have had a prior positive PPD test or an ulcerating reaction to the TB Skin Test in the past should not be re -exposed and the TB Skin Test should be considered positive. Subjects with a negative TB test and chest x -ray not suggestive of active TB or prior TB exposure may be enrolled. If the QuantiFERON -TB Gold test is indeterminate, the site should repeat the test with another blood sample and/or perform a PPD test. If the second QuantiFERON TB Gold test is also indeterminate or positive, the subject is considered to be positive for the purpose of the stud y. If the second QuantiFERON- TB Gold test is negative, the subject is considered to be negative."

If the repeat testing result is negative, the investigator may consider the subject to be negative based on his/her clinical judgment. If the repeat testing result is positive or indeterminate, the subject is considered to be positive. Subjects with a positive TB test must be assessed for evidence of active TB versus lat ent TB, including signs and sy mptoms and chest x -ray. Subjects with no signs or symptoms and a chest x -ray not suggestive of active TB may be enrolled after initiation of TB prophy laxis (see below). Subjects with evidence of active TB must not be enrolle d. Subjects with history of active TB may be enrolled if it has been adequatel y treated with no evidence of current active TB; subjects with inadequate documentation of treatment should be cleared b y a TB specialist prior to enrollment. TB Prophylaxis At screening, if the subject has evidence of latent TB infection (no symptoms, positive TB test and the subject has a chest x -ray not suggestive of active TB), proph ylactic treatment must be initiated at least 2 weeks prior to administration of study drug (or per local guidelines, whichever is longer). At least 6 months of proph ylaxis needs to be completed; however, the full course of proph ylaxis does not need to be completed prior to the firstdose of study drug.

The information will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. However, these procedures should not interfere with the initiation of an y new treatments or therapeutic modalities that the investigator feels are necessary to treat the subject's condition. Following discontinuation ofstudy drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the investigator's best clinical judgment irrespective of whether the subject decides to continue participation in the study.

The objectives of Part 3 are to offer blinded upadacitinib induction treatment to placebo non -responders from Part 1 and to evaluate a delay edclinical response to upadacitinib in subjects who did not initially respond to upadacitinib during Part1 or Part 2. Part 3 consists of 3 cohorts, and the treatment assignment will depend on the treatment received in Part 1 or Part 2, as follows: ●Cohort 1: Subjects who received placebo in Part 1 and did not achieve clinical response at Week 12 are eligible to receive double -blind induction treatment with upadacitinib 45 mg QD. ●Cohort 2: Subjects who received double -blind upadacitinib in Part 1 and did not achieve clinical response at Week 12 are eligible to receive double -blind upadacitinib 30 mg QD. ●Cohort 3: Subjects who received open- label upadacitinib during Part 2 and did not achieve clinical response at Week 12 are eligible to receive open -label upadacitinib 30 mg QD. Subjects in Cohort 1 and 2 will remain blinded to treatment to avoid unmasking the treatment received during Part 1. Subjects are not eligible to enter in Part 3 until the Week 12 endoscop y has been completed. If the COVID -19 pan demic precludes a subject from undergoing an endoscopy, the subject can continue in Part 3. At Week 24, subjects who achieve clinical response may be eligible to enter Study M14 -430. Subjects are not eligible to enter Study M14 -430 until the ileocolonoscopy procedure at Week 24 for evaluation of mucosal inflammation has been completed. If the COVID -19 pandemic precludes a subject from undergoing an endoscop y, the subject can enroll in Study M14 -430 if clinical response was achieved at Week 24."

Subjects who do not achieve clinical response at Week 24 and all subjects who prematurel y discontinue the study will have a follow -up visit 30 day s from the last dose of study drug to collect information on new or ongoing AEs and laboratory assessments. 5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject Subjects should take study drug as outlined in Section 5.5.1. On dosing day s that occur on study visit day s, subjects should follow the regular dosing schedule (refer to Section 5.3.2.1 regarding Week 4 visit). Each subject's dosing schedule should be closel y monitored by the site at each study visit. This will ensure that all subjects enrolled into the study maintain their original dosing schedule beginning with the first dose of stud y drug (Baseline/Day 1). If a subject should forget to take their upadacitinib (or matching placebo) dose at their regularl y scheduled dosing time, they should take the forgotten dose as soon a s they remember the dose was missed as long as it is at least 10 hours before their next scheduled dose. If a subject only remembers the missed dose within 10 hours before next scheduled dose, the subject should skip the missed dose and take the next dose at the scheduled time. For elective and emergency surgeries, the following rules appl y: ●If the subject must undergo emergency surgery , the study drug should be interrupted at the time of the surgery. After emergency surgery, allow reintroduction of stu dy drug once the ph ysician has examined the surgical site and determined that it has healed and there is no sign of infection. ●Elective surgery will not be allowed during the study until the primary endpoint has been assessed. If the subject undergoes ele ctive surgery , the study drug should be interrupted 1 week prior to the planned surgery . Reintroduction of study drug is allowed once the phys ician has examined the surgical site and determined that it has healed and there is no sign of infection."

The proposed stud y is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled induction study to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of upadacitinib in adult subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of CD for at least 3 months and moderatel y to severel y active CD who have inadequatel y responded to or are intolerant to biologic therap y. This study will evaluate one induction dose of upadacitinib 45 mg QD. In Part 1, subjects (n = 495) will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to 45 mg upadacitinib QD or matching placebo for 12 weeks. The randomization will be stratified by baseline corticosteroid use (y es or no), endoscopic disease severit y (SES -CD < 15 and ≥ 15), and number of prior biologic treatments (> 1 and ≤ 1). At this time, a 12 -week placebo- controlled study is neces sary for registrational purposes. A comparative study utilizing placebo provides an unbiased assessment of the efficacy and safety profile of upadacitinib. Part 2 is an open -label portion (open- label cohort) of this study . Once enrollment in Part1 is complete, approximately 130subjects will be enrolled to receive upadacitinib 45mg QD for 12 weeks. The objective of Part 2 is to have a sufficient number of subjects with clinical response to be re -randomized in the double -blind maintenance portion of Study M14 -430, while minimizing unnecessary exposure to placebo. To ensure all subjects are given the opportunity to receive potentially efficacious therap y, all subjects in Part 1 or Part 2 who do not achieve clinical response after 12 weeks will be able to enroll in Part 3, an Extended Treatment Period for 12 weeks. Part 3 consists of 3cohorts. The first objective of Part 3 is to offer blinded upadacitinib induction treatment"
107,page_107,"Upadacitinib (ABT -494) M14 -431 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2017 -001226 -18 108 to placebo non -responders from Part 1. In the upadacitinib Phase 2 Study M13- 740, some subjects achieved clinical remission between Week 12 a nd Week 16 with upadacitinib 6mg BID, 24 mg BID and 24 mg QD. This study will also evaluate delay ed clinical response to upadacitinib in subjects who did not initially respond to upadacitinib 45 mg QD during Part 1 or Part 2. In Part 3, these subjects w ill receive upadacitinib 30 mg QD for an additional 12 weeks. The study was designed to enroll 625subjects to meet scientific and regulatory objectives, without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations. 5.6.2 Appropriaten ess of Measurements Standard statistical, clinical, and laboratory procedures will be utilized in this study . All efficacy measurements in this study are standard for assessing disease activity in subjects with CD. All clinical and laboratory procedures in this study are standard and generally accepted. Central reading of endoscop y will increase study rigor and ensure enrollment of patients with moderatel y to severel y active CD. 5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population Adult male and female subjects between 18 to 75 y ears of age (or minimum age of adult consent according to local regulations) with moderately to severely active CD, who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, are eligible for enrollment in this study . The specific p opulation chosen was based on the unmet medical need of subjects with a history of inadequate response or intolerance to biologic therap y. 5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study This study will evaluate one induction dose of upadacitinib (45 mg QD) ( Figure 1). The selection of this dose was informed b y the analysis of the 16- week safet y, efficacy and exposure -response data of Phase 2 CD Study M13 -740, which ev aluated 5 induction doses of upadacitinib using the immediate -release formulation (3, 6, 12 or 24 mg BID or 24mg QD) versus placebo. I n addition, all of the currentl y available PK, pharmacod ynamic, safety, and efficacy data from upadacitinib studies were used to"
108,page_108,"Upadacitinib (ABT -494) M14 -431 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2017 -001226 -18 109 support the selection of this dose. The induction phase results from Stud yM13- 740 demonstrated the clinical and endoscopic efficacy of upadacitinib compared to placebo with doses of 6 mg BID and higher. Upadacitinib dose of 45 mg QD using the once -daily formulation provides equivalent daily area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) and comparable maximum plasma concentration (C max) and minimum plasma concentration (C min) to 18 mg BID dose using the immediate -release formulation. I n the CD Phase 2 study , the dose of 12 mg BID and higher were shown to approach the plateau of efficacy for clinical endpoints while increasing the dose to 24 mg BID provided additional efficacy benefit particularl y for the endoscopic endpoints. Therefore, 45 mg Q D regimen using the once -daily formulation (equivalent to 18 mg BID immediate -release) is predicted to provide the optimal balance between maximizing efficacy while limiting the effects on laboratory parameters (e.g., decreases in hemoglobin and NK cells). Upadacitinib 45 mg QD, dosed for up to 12weeks is expected to be efficacious with an acceptable safet y profile and upadacitinib 15 mg QD and 30 mg QD, dosed for up to 240 weeks as maintenance treatment, are expected to be efficacious with acceptable saf ety profiles. 6.0 Complaints A Complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the ph ysical characteristics, identity , quality , purit y, potency, durability , reliability , safet y, effectiveness, or performance o f a product/device after it is released for distribution.

An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product. Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal. An y worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an AE. Worsening in severit y of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE. Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation from the study , necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them to be AEs. An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during the study will not be considered an AE if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition or the surgery /procedure has been pre -planned prior to study entry . However, if the pre -existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than"

Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject. Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken. This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form. Hospitalization or Prolongation of HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for an y length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay. This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility . Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or an y anomaly that results in fetal loss. Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living (ADL) of a study subject. Disability is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., spra ined ankle)."

These variables can take values of 'Achieved' or 'Not Achieved' or may be missing for an y reason including discontinuation from study . According to the NRI approach, all missing values will be considered as 'Not Achieved.' Observed Cases (OC): The OC anal ysis will not impute values for missing evaluations, and thus a subject who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will be excluded from the OC anal ysis for that visit . 8.1.3 Subject Disposition The number and percentage of subjects who are enrolled, randomized, and received at least one dose of stud y drug, the number of subjects who completed the study and the number of subjects who prematurel y discontinued and the reason fo r premature discontinuation will be summarized by treatment group. Premature discontinuation of study drug will be summarized for each treatment group, as well as for all subjects combined, with frequencies and percentages overall and by reason for discon tinuation for all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study drug. Subjects may have multiple reasons for prematurely discontinuing study drug, but will be counted no more than once for the total (""Any Reason""). 8.1.4 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Demographics and baseline characteristics of the study subjects will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Summary statistics for continuous variables will include the number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, and ran ge for each treatment group. For other categorical or discrete variables, frequencies and percentages will be computed"

The comparison between treatment groups on the co -primary efficacy endpoints will be performed using the Cochran -Mantel- Haenszel (CMH) test and will be stratified by Baseline corticosteroid use (y es or no), endoscopic disease severit y (SES -CD < 15 and ≥15), and number of prior biologics used (> 1 and ≤ 1). Both of the co- primary efficacy endpoints will be tested at two -sided significance level of 0.05. A CMH based two -sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between treatment groups will be calcu lated. If the average dail y ver y soft or liquid SF or average daily AP score (EU/EMA) or CDAI (US/FDA) data at Week 12 are missing, the NRI approach will be applied for the clinical remission per PROs and clinical remission per CDAI endpoints, respectivel y.

Specificall y, testing will utilize a sequence of h ypothesis testing for the co -primary endpoints followed by the ranked secondary endpoints, and will begin with testing co -primary endpoints using α of 0.05 (2-sided). If both co- primary endpoints achi eve statistical significance, continued testing will follow a pre specified weight of α allocation between individual h ypotheses as well as between families of h ypotheses. The details of the testing procedure will be specified and documented in the SAP. In general, continuous secondary efficacy variables with repeated measurements will be analyzed using a Mixed Effect Repeated Measure (MMRM) model. Continuous secondary efficacy variables which are collected at only one post -baseline visit (such as SES-CD) will be analyzed using an Anal ysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model. Categorical secondary efficacy variables will be analy zed using the CMH test controlling for stratification variables. NRI for missing data will be used for categorical secondary endpoints. 8.1.7 Safety Analyses Safety anal yses will be performed on safety analysis sets (Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3), as defined in Section 8.1.1.2 . Incidence o f AEs, changes in vital signs, ph ysical examination results, and clinical laboratory data will be assessed throughout the stud y.

Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as events that begin or worsen either on or after the first dos e of the stud y drug and within 30 days after the last dose of the study drug for subjects who do not participate in Study M14 -430, or within 30 day s after the last dose of the study drug in Study M14 -431 or first dose of study drug in Study M14 -430 if the subject enrolls in Study M14 -430, whichever comes first. An overview of treatment -emergent AEs, including AEs leading to death, AEs leading to premature discontinuation, AEs by MedDRA preferred term and s ystem organ class, AEs by maximum relationship to st udy drug, AEs b y maximum severity and AEs of special interest will be summarized by number and percentage. Changes from Baseline in continuous laboratory and vital sign parameters will be summarized by treatment group. Treatment group differences between upadacitinib and placebo groups for changes from Baseline may be anal yzed using a one -way ANOVA.

Data from this study may be combined with data from other studies for the population PK and exposure -response analy ses. Population PK and exposure -response analy ses of onl y data from this study may not be conducted. The following general methodology will be used for the population PK and exposure -response anal yses. Population PK analy ses will be performed using the actual sampling time relative to dosing. PK models will be buil t using a non- linear mixed -effects modeling approach with NONMEM software (Version 7, or a higher version). The structure of the starting PK"
129,page_129,"Upadacitinib (ABT -494) M14 -431 Protocol Amendment 7 EudraCT 2017 -001226 -18 130 model will be based on the PK anal ysis of data from previous studies. The CL /F and V/F of upadacitinib will be th e PK parameters of major interest in the anal yses. If necessary, other parameters, including the parameters describing absorption characteristics, may be fixed if useful in the analysis. The evaluation criteria described below will be used to examine the performance of different models. 1. The objective function of the best model is significantly smaller than the alternative model(s). 2. The observed and predicted concentrations from the preferred model are more randomly distributed across the line of unity (a s traight line with zero intercept and a slope of one) than the alternative model(s). 3. Visual inspection of model fits, standard errors of model parameters and change in inter-subject and intra -subject error. Once an appropriate base PK model (including inte r-and intra -subject error structure) is developed, empirical Bayesian estimates of individual model parameters will be calculated b y the posterior conditional estimation technique using non -linear mixed - effects modeling. The relationship between these co nditional estimate CL /F and V/F values with only potentially physiologically relevant or clinically meaningful covariates (such as subject age, sex, body weight, concomitant medications, laboratory markers of hepatic of renal function, etc.) will be explored using stepwise forward selection method, or another suitable regression/smoothing method at a significance level of 0.05. After identification of all relevant covariates, a stepwise backward elimination of covariates from the full model will be employ ed to evaluate the significance (at P < 0.005, corresponding to a decrease in objective function > 7.88 for one degree of freedom) of each covariate in the full model. Linear or non -linear relationships of primary PK parameters with various covariates will be explored."

Exposure -response relationships for efficacy variables and/or some safet y measures of interest may also be explored. The rela tionship between exposure (e.g., population PK model predicted average concentrations, area under the curve, trough concentrations, the individual model -predicted PK profiles, or some other appropriate measure of exposure) and drug effect will be explored. Several classes of models (e.g., linear, log -linear, exponential, maximum effect [E max], sigmoid E max, etc.) will be evaluated to characterize the exposure -response relationship based on observed data. Results of the PK and exposure -response analy ses ma y be summarized in a separate report prior to regulatory filing of upadacitinib for the treatment of CD, rather than in the CSR. Additional analy ses will be performed if useful and appropriate. 8.2 Determination of Sample Size The co -primary endpoints are the proportion of subjects with clinical remission per PROs (EU/EMA) and per CDAI (US/FDA) at Week 12 and the proportion of subjects who achieve endoscopic response at Week 12. Sample size calculation is based on the maximum sample size needed to detect treat ment difference for each of the co- primary endpoints. The assumptions used were based on the 16-week clinical and endoscopic data from the upadacitinib Phase 2 CD Study M13 -740. For EU/EMA regulatory purposes: Assuming a rate of 12% for clinical remiss ion per PROs in the placebo group and 29% in the upadacitinib group at Week 12, a total sample size of 495 subjects randomized in a 2:1 ratio (330 subjects in the upadacitinib group and 165 subjects in the placebo group) will be adequate to detect at least a 17% treatment difference in clinical remission rates at Week 12 between the treatment groups using Fisher's exact test with at least 95% power at a 0.05 two -sided significant level. For US/FDA regulatory purposes: Assuming a rate of 20% for clinical remission per CDAI in the placebo group and 40% in the upadacitinib group at Week 12, the same"

Assuming an endoscopic response rate of 10% in the placebo group and 25% in the upadacitinib group at Week 12, this sample size will be adequate to detect at least a 15% treatment difference in endoscopic response rates at Week 12 between the treatment groups using Fisher's exact test with at least 95% power at a 0.05 two -sided significant level. The objective of Part 2 is to have a sufficient number of subjects with clinical response to be re -randomized in the double -blind maintenance portion of Study M14 -430. A total of 130subjects enrolled in Part 2 would provide adequate number of subjects achie ving clinical response to be re -randomized to the maintenance portion of Study M14 -430. 8.3 Randomization Methods A total of 495 subjects will be randomized in Part 1 of the study in a 2:1 ratio to upadacitinib 45 mg QD or matching placebo (330 subjects for upadacitinib 45 mg dose group and 165 for placebo group). Randomization will be stratified by baseline corticosteroid use (y es or no), endoscopic disease severit y (SES -CD < 15 and ≥ 15), and number of prior biologic treatments (> 1 and ≤ 1).

Update inclusion/exclusion, prior and concomitant therapy, and medical/surgical history information to assure subject eligibility. All subjects need to have their average daily very soft or liquid SF and average daily AP score calculated and meeting eligibility criteria before randomization at Baselin e. d. Physical examinations are f ull physical examinations performed at Screening, Baseline, and Week 12; and Week 24/PD if the subject undergoes Part 3. Phy sical examinations at all other visits are symptom -based but should include an assessment of EIMs and presence or absence of cutane ous fistulas, as part of calculating the CDAI. During the full physical examination, all subjects will be assessed for presence and number of draining and non -draining enterocutaneous (perianal and abdominal) and rectovaginal fistulas at Baseline, Week 12 , and Week 24/PD. If the assessment of presence and number of draining and non -draining fistulas were performed during Screening or the visit for endoscopy, this may be used for the respective Baseline, Week 12 or Week 24/PD visits. e. Blood pressure, pulse rate, temperature, respiratory rate and weight should be performed before blood draws are performed. Height will be measu red at Screening only (with shoes off). f. Ileocolonoscopies will be used to calculate the SES -CD. The Screening ileocolonoscopy s hould be done during the Screening Period or within 45 days of the Baseline Visit, if video recorded. Endoscopic evaluations using SES -CD confirmed by central reader will be done at Screening. Patients who complete at least 8 weeks in Part 1 and Part 2 or at least 20 weeks in Part 3 will be required to have an endoscopy. Where COVID -19 or any pandemic affects Week 12 or Week 24 endoscopy, a ± 7-day window is permitted. g. Biopsy may be done when performing the endoscopy. At Screening, biopsy to confirm CD diagnosis must be done when performing the endoscopy if appropriate documentation for confirmation of the diagnosis does not exist. Biopsies to rule out dysplasia and colon cancer may be taken at the investigator's discretion. Optional intestinal biop sy samples for histopathology and biological investigations, including but not limited to, transcriptomic analyses and immuno histochemistry may be evaluated in approximately 200 subjects (intestinal biopsy substudy). h. Subjects with normal ECG within 90 d ays of Screening would not require a repeat ECG, if documentation is available. Subjects can have a repeat ECG at any time d uring the study as warranted based on the opinion of the investigator. i. PPD skin test is to be read 48 to 72 hours after placement. Subjects with negative QuantiFERON TB Gold test and/or PPD test within 90 days of Screening will not require a repeat test (documentation must be available). In case of positive PPD/positive or repeat indeterminate IGRA testing, in the absence of active TB, the subject may participate in the study after initiation of latent TB treatment (regimen according to local practice/guidelines). j. Chest x -ray includes posterior-anterior view and lateral view. Subjects can have a chest x -ray anytime during the study as warranted based on the opinion of the investigator. In Japan and China, a CT scan of the chest may be performed in lieu of a chest x -ray, at the investigator's discretion. k. FSH should be tested at Screening if the female subject is ≤ 55 years of age AND has had no menses ≥ 12 months AND has no history of perman ent surgical sterilization (Refer to Section 5.2.4 ). l. Subjects will be tested for the presence of HBV and HCV at Screening. A positive result for HBs Ag or hepatitis C (HCV RNA d etectable in any subject with anti -HCV Ab) will be exclusionary. For subjects who are negative for both HBs Ag and HBs Ab but are positive for HBc Ab, HBV DNA PCR will be performed and any result that meets or exceeds detection sensitivity will be exclusionary. HIV testing will be performed at the central laboratory, unless prohi bited by local regulations. The central lab will report the HIV test results directly to the sites. AbbVie will not receive results from the HIV testing and not be made aware of any positive result."

For Japan or countries who mandate periodic screening for HBV: subjects with positive HBs Ab and/or posi tive HBc Ab and a negative HBV DNA PCR test result at Screening should have HBV DNA PCR test performed at 12 and 24 weeks; in cases where recurrence of HBV DNA is observed, the su bject should be discontinued from the study. This measure is not necessary i n patients with history of HBV vaccination and positive HBs Ab result. n. Laboratory tests performed during the Screening Period can be repeated in case the abnormalities are considered to be transie nt by the investigator. o. Minimum 8 -hour fast for chemis try. If a subject is not able to fast, the non -fasting status will be recorded in study source documentation. Urinalysis, chemistry and hematology may be collected at other scheduled and unscheduled visits than indicated in the table in case of repeat te st for toxicity management criteria or if they are warranted by the investigator. p. Urinalysis will be completed by the central lab at the required visits. A microscopic analysis will be performed in the even t the dipstick results show leukocytes, nitrite, protein, ketones, or blood greater than negative or glucose greater than normal. q. Serum pregnancy test will be performed on all women of childbearing potential at Screening. Urine pregnancy test will be per formed locally at the Baseline Visit prior to the first dose of study drug and at all subsequent visits, including the 30-day follow -up visit for all women of childbearing potential (refer to Section 5.2.4 ). If any urine pregnancy test is positive, a serum pregnancy test will be performed by the central laboratory. If serum pregnancy test come s back borderline, a repeat test is necessary (pregnancy is an exclusion criterion). If still borde rline ≥ 3 days later, this will be considered documentation of continued lack of a positive result and the subject can be enrolled into the study in absence of clinical suspicion of pregnancy or other pathological cause of borderline result. If a pregnanc y is identified, the pregnancy must be reported to AbbVie. r. At the Week 4 visit, PK samples should be collected prior to dosing if possible and the subjects should take the study drug d ose at the clinic after collecting the PK blood sample. However, if the subject normally takes the study drug dose at a time that is after the time of the scheduled study visit, the subject sho uld follow the regular dosing schedule and the PK sample should be collected at any time during the visit. At Week 16 and Week 20 visits, PK samples will not be collected from subjects in Part 3 Cohort 3, who received open -label upadacitinib in Part 2. For all other visits, PK samples should be collected at any time during the visit and the subj ect should follow the regular dosing s chedule. s. A stool sample will be collected at each time point indicated for FCP. For the visit that endoscopy will be conducted, stool sample should be collected prior to bowel prep. Subjects will be asked to provide a stool sample at the visit, if pos sible, or the site will give instructions and a stool sample supply kit. t.

Patient Reported Outcomes Descriptions IBDQ –Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire The IBDQ is a disease -specific instrument composed of 32 Likert -scaled items. The total score ranges from 32 to 224 using the 7 -point response options, with higher scores indicating better health -related quality of life. The IBDQ scale cont ains 4 component subscales: bowel s ymptoms, sy stemic s ymptoms, emotional function, and social function. Each subscale can be computed with total scores ranging from 10 –70, 5 to 35, 12 to 84, and 5 to 35, respectively .27,28 WPAI -CD –Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire -Crohn's Disease The Work Productivity and Activity Index assesses the impact of the condition on work productivity losses and impairment in daily activity . WPAI has six items covering four domains: Absenteeism (work time missed), measured as the number of hours missed from work in the past 7 day s due to a condition related problems. Scores are expressed as impairment percentages, adjusting for hours actually worked according to the WPAI scoring algorithm; Presenteeism (impairment at work/reduced on -the-job effectiveness), measured as the impact of the condition on productivity while at work (i.e., reduced amount or kind of work, or not as focused as usual). Response s are recorded on a 0 – 10Likert scale (where, 0 = no effect of CD on work and 10 = severe impact of CD while at work); productivity loss (overall work impairment), measured as the sum of hours missed due to condition i.e., absenteeism and number of hours worked with impairment i.e.,product of number of hours worked and presenteeism; and activity impairment (i.e., activities other than paid work like work around house, cleaning, shopping, traveling, study ing), recorded and scored in same way as presenteei sm. Higher numbers indicate greater impairment and less productivity .29"

The VAS records the subject's assessment of his/her own health along a vertical 20 cm line, which has health state scores between 0 and 100.32 FACIT- F –Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -Fatigue The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therap y system is a collection of quality of life (QoL) questionnaires targeted to the management of cancer and other chronic illnesses. The FACIT -F questionnaire was developed to assess fatigue associated with anemia. It consists of 13 fatigue -related questions. The responses to the 13 items on the FACIT -F questionnaire are each measured on a 4 -point L ikert scale. The responses to the answers are the following: (i) not at all: 0 points; (ii) a little bit: 1 point; (iii) somewhat: 2points; (iv) qui te a bit: 3 points; (v) very much: 4 points. Thus, the total score ranges from 0 to 52. High scores represent less fatigue.33 PGIC –Patient Global Impression of Change The PGI C is a self -administered instrument that assesses change in the overall sy mptoms due to Crohn's disease. The PGI C is one item in which subjects are asked to rate overall improve ment since start of the treatment.
