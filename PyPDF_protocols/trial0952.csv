This amendment will be submitted to the Regulatory Authorities prior to the start of dosing in part B . Change s to protocol and affected sections are summarized below. Change Sections Changed Based on data from part A and PK simulations , as well as data from study R668 -AD-1652, dose regimens were added to the protocol for part B of study. In part B, patients (≥6 mos-<6 yrs) will be randomized to receive either placebo or dupilumab (200 mg for patients ≥5-<15 kg or 3 00 mg for patients ≥15-<30 kg) every 4 weeks ( Q4W). Randomization stratification in part B was changed from by age group and region to by body weight , baseline disease severity, and region /country . PK data from part A and from other completed dupilumab studies ha ve shown that weight rather than age is the most important covariate that determines exposure. Accordingly, a weight -tiered fixed-dose regimen was chosen for part B. Randomization stratified by weight will enable patients to receive correct dose for weight category and normalize exposure across weight ranges. Study drug treatment will be administered by study site personne l during part B. Added description of how blinding will be maintained during part B.

Section 9.1 Statistical Hypothesis Section 9.2 Justification of Sample Size Section 9.5.2.1 Primary Efficacy Analysi s The target population with respect to disease severity was changed from severe AD to moderate - to-severe AD for part B. In initial interactions with a Competent Author ity which were held at a time when there was no data on the use of dupilumab in the pediatric population, the sponsor was advised to limit the patient population to severe patients. Since then, dupilumab has been tested in multiple clinical studies in pediat ric patients and shown to provide considerable clinical benefit to pediatric patients with an acceptable safety profile. Accordingly, the sponsor was recently advised to broaden the patient population to moderate -to- severe disease by a Competent Authority . This will maximize the number of patients that will benefit from this drug and facilitate enrollment in study.

TCS standardization ensures only patients with inadequate response to TCS are enrolled as patients who respond will be considered screen failures at the baseline visit. This will enable a more accurate estimate of the true treatment effect of dupilumab. Use of medium potency steroids was changed to low potency steroids as required during the study. This age group is particularly vulnerable to the systemic side effects of TCS such as hypothalamic pituitary axis suppression due to increased systemic absorption resulting from a higher surface area to body weight ratio as compared to older children and adu lts. Use of low potency TCS is expected to mitigate this risk and maximize patient safety. Clarified use of background and rescue treatments during the study, including treatments permitted and prohibited. Specified rescue treatment only allowed after day 14 in part B. This ensures investigators give study drug adequate time for onset of effect before resorting to other available medications of rescue. As patients who are rescued are considered non-responders, this will enable an accurate assessment of tr eatment effect of the study drug. Medium potency TCS has been added as rescue treatment. In previous versions of this protocol, patients were required to have moisturizers applied at least twice daily during the 7 consecutive days prior to randomization (14/14 total applications) and during study. This criterion was relaxed to require at least 11/14 total applications prior to randomization for patient to be eligible. This change was based on feedback from investigators that the previous criterion was fel t to be overly stringent in a pediatric population. Corrected post -randomization duration of application of moisturizers for part B to 28 weeks. A pre-specified algorithm will be used to classify rescue treatment for responder analysis . A blinded review o f post -baseline medications will be done to adjudicate rescue treatment.

Specifically, given the age group being studied, it is expected that a substantial proportion of patients would need a course of treatment with medium potency TCS for 4 weeks during screening period to demonstrate inadequate response, and hence meet inclusion criterion 3 (Patients with documented recent history of inadequate response to topical AD medication(s)) Section 4.2.1 Inclusion Criteri a #3 and #10 Figure 3 Study Flow Diagram (Part B) Section 5.7.1 Prohibited Medications and Procedures Table 2 Schedule of Events for the Screening, Treatment, and Follow -Up Period (Part B) Added other (exploratory) objectives to assess effects of dupilumab on blood and skin biomarkers and to study its mechanism of action (related to efficacy and/or safety), why some patients respond better (safety an d/or efficacy), and interleukin (IL) -4 receptor pathway, and AD and related diseases.

Page 17 CONFIDENTIAL Study Design This study is a 2 -part (parts A and B) phase 2/3 study to evaluate the safety, PK, and efficacy of dupilumab in patients 6 months to less than 6 years of age with severe AD (part A) , or moderate to severe AD (part B) . Part A Part A of the study will be an open -label, single -ascending dose, sequential cohort study investigating the PK, safety and efficacy of a single dose of SC dupilumab in pediatric patients with severe AD (children aged ≥6 months to <6 years of age). Two sequential age cohorts are planned in part A: age cohort 1 (≥2 to <6 yrs old) and age cohort 2 (≥6 months to <2 yrs old). Within each age cohort, approximately 10 patients will be enrolled in each of the 2 dose sub -cohorts: sub-cohort A (3 mg/kg) and sub -cohort B (6 mg/kg). Enrollment and study dosing will start with cohort 1A (≥2 to <6 yrs old, 3 mg/kg dose, n=10). Following safety review of data from cohort 1A, enrollment will start in both cohort 1B (≥2 to <6 yrs. old, 6 mg/kg dose, n=10) and cohort 2A (≥6 months to <2 yrs old, 3 mg/kg dose, n=10). Following safety review of data from cohort 2A, enrollment will start in cohort 2B (≥6 months to <2 yrs old, 6 mg/kg dose, n=10). Part A of the study will consist of a screening period (day -35 to day -1), a baseline visit (day 1), a single -dose treatment followed by a 4 -week PK sampling period, and an additional 4 -week follow -up period (only for patients who decline to p articipate in a subsequent open -label extension [OLE] study). After informed consent is provided by patients’ parents or legal guardians, patients will be assessed for study eligibility at the screening visit. Patients who meet eligibility criteria will undergo baseline assessments and then proceed to p art A to receive their single dose of study treatment on day 1 and undergo functional dupilumab PK sample collection during the following 4 weeks for characterizing the single -dose PK profile. All patients will be offered an opportunity to participate in the OLE study at week 4. Patients who decline will be followed up for an additional 4 weeks (total of 8 weeks). This will ensure a sufficient follow -up period for these patients and will maximize patient safety. Concomitant use of TCS with or without to pical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) will be permitted during part A of the study. Part B Part B of the study is a randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled study in which dupilumab will be administered concomitantly with TCS to patients ≥6 months to <6 years of age with moderate -to-severe AD . Part B will consist of a screening period of up to 56 days (including 2 weeks of TCS standardization ), a treatment period of 16 weeks, and a follow -up period of up to 12 weeks. Patient s who enrolled in part A of the study are not eligible to participate in part B. After informed VV-RIM-00131070-1.0 Approved - 28 Oct 2020 GMT-5:00"

Assent will be collected from patient, if applicable, as per local regulatory (competent authority/ethics) guidelines, based upon the age and level of maturity of the patient. During the screening period, systemic treatments for AD will be washed out, as applicable, according to the eligibility requirements. The use of TCS will be permitted during the screening period. Starting on day -14, all patients will be required to initiate treatment with a low potency TCS using a standardized regimen . Based on investigator discretion, l ow potency TCS may also be used on areas of thin skin. The use of TCIs will be permitted during the screening period except for the 2 -week period leading up to the baseline visit. During part B, patients will be required to apply moisturizers twice dail y for at least 7 days before randomization (not including the day of randomization) and continue throughout the study. Patients who continue to meet eligibility criteria at baseline will undergo day 1/baseline assessments and will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio stratified by baseline body weight ( ≥5-<15 kg and ≥ 15-<30 kg), baseline disease severity (IGA=3, 4), and region /country (North America, Europe, Japan, and China ) as follows : • dupilumab (fixed dosing tiered by body weight every 4 weeks (Q4W): 200 mg Q4W for patients ≥5 to <15 kg or 300 mg for patients ≥15 to < 30 kg Q4W . • placebo Q4W. The number of patients with moderate AD (IGA=3) will be capped at approximately 40. During the treatment period, patients will have in -clinic visits at week 1, week 2, and week 4, then monthly in -clinic visits through week 16 with weekly telephone visits in between the in -clinic visits. After completion of the treatment period, patients will enter a follow -up period of 12 weeks (only for patients who do not participate in a subsequent OLE study) . Follow -up visits for these patients will occur every 4 weeks from week 20 through week 28. During the follow -up period, patients will be monitored for safety and tolerability and have laboratory and clinical assessments. Parts A and B Safety and laboratory assessments, samples for dupilumab concentration and anti -drug antibody (ADA) response to dupilumab, neutralizing antibod y (NAbs), and efficacy assessments will be performed or collected at specified time points throughout parts A and B of the study.

For part B, patients are required to have moisturizers (emollients) applied at least twice daily for at least the 7 consecutive days immediately before randomization (not including the day of randomization) . At least 11 of the 14 total applications must be applied for the subject to remain eligible for the st udy. Patients are to continue to have moisturizers applied throughout the remainder of the study (all 28 weeks where applicable). However, to allow adequate assessment of skin dryness, moisturizers should not be applied for at least 8 hours before each c linic visit. All types of moisturizers are permitted, but patients may not initiate treatment with prescription moisturizers or moisturizers containing additives during the screening period or during the study. Patients may continue using stable doses of such moisturizers if initiated before the screening visit. For part B, starting on day -14, all patients are required to initiate treatment with low potency TCS using a standardized regimen according to protocol -specified guidelines. A list of steroids that can be used during the study will be provided to the investigators as part of the investigator site binder. Based on investigator discretion, low/mild potency TCS may also be used on areas of thin skin (face, neck, intertriginous, and genital areas, areas of skin atrophy, etc). Rescue Treatment Dose/Route/Schedule: For parts A and B, medium or high potency TCS, systemic corticosteroids or non steroidal immunosuppressants, or TCI may be provided as rescue treatment to study patien ts at the discretion of the investigator. The use of rescue treatment is only allowed after day 14 of the study in part B.

Introduction Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a pruritic skin condition characterized by a chronic, relapsing form of skin inflammation, a disturban ce of the epidermal -barrier function associated with immune changes in the skin, and a high prevalence of immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated sensitization to food and environmental allergens ( Bieber 2008 ). Atopic dermatitis is one of t he most common skin disorders in infants and children ( Mortz 2015 ). The prevalence of AD in the first 2 years of life has been reported to be 21.5% ( Ileli 2004 ). Phase 3 of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood showed a 1 -year period prevalence rate higher than 15% in the 6 to 7 -year-old age group in Australia, England, and Scandinavia ( Asher 2006 ). The clinical pattern of AD varies with age. Infants typically present with erythematous papules and vesicles on the cheeks, forehead, or scalp, which are exudative and intensely pruritic. The childhood phase typically occurs from 2 years of age to puberty. Children present with lichenified papules and plaques repre senting the more chronic disease involving the hands, feet, wrists, ankles, and antecubital and popliteal regions. In adults, predominant areas of involvement include the flexural folds, the face and neck, the upper arms and back, and the dorsa of the han ds, feet, fingers, and toes. The eruption is characterized by dry, scaling erythematous papules and plaques, and the formation of large lichenified plaques from lesional chronicity. The disease has been shown to have a marked impact on the quality of life (QOL) of pediatric patients, greater than that seen in other common skin disorders like psoriasis and urticaria (Beattie 2006 ). A study comparing the impact on the QOL of family members of children suffering from eczema and type 1 diabetes found that all families of children with moderate -to-severe eczema had significantly higher impact scores than those of diabetic children (Su 1997 ). Often, severe pruritus is a universal finding in AD and often results in sleep disruption, irritability, and generalized stress for both the affected patients as well as family members (Kim 2012 ). Of particular interest in younger children is the phenomenon of “Atopic March” which is characterized by a t ypical sequence of progression of clinical signs of atopic disease. In general, the clinical signs of AD and of food allergies predate the development of asthma and allergic rhinitis, suggesting that AD is an “entry point” for subsequent allergic disease (Spergel 2003 ). Severity of AD is correlated with development of asthma and allergic rhinitis ( Zheng 2011 ). Infants and young children with severe AD have a reported risk rate of around 60% for developing asthma later on in life compared to a risk of around 30% in patients with mild AD ( Ricci 2006 ).

35,page_35,"Clinical Study Protocol R668 -AD-1539 Amendment 4 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc . Page 36 CONFIDENTIAL Atopic dermatitis is caused by a complex interaction of genetics, defects in skin barrier function, environmental exposure, and immunologic r esponses. Type 2 helper T cell (Th2) mediated immune response is believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of AD. The skin lesions of AD are characterized by increased expression of proinflammatory Th2 cytokines, such as interleukin (IL) -4 and IL-13, and by skin infiltration of Th2 cells. The elevated IgE responses and eosinophilia observed in the majority of patients with AD reflects an increased expression of the Th2 cytokines IL -4 and IL -13 (Leung 1999 ). Type 2 helper T cell-associated cytokines regulate important barrier related functions, such as epidermal cornification and production of antimicrobial proteins. These cytokines inhibit the production of major terminal differentiation proteins, such as loricrin, filag grin, involucrin, and the antimicrobial proteins human beta defensin 2 and 3, which in turn, is associated with development of AD ( Howell 2007 , Guttman Yassky 2011a , Guttman Yassky 2011b ). The Th2 cytokines also act on keratinocytes and induce production of chemokines, including chemokine (C -C motif) ligand 17 (also known as thymus and activation regulated chemokine [TARC]), and chemokine (C -C motif) ligand 26 (also known as eotaxin -3), wh ich are chemo -attractants for Th2 cells and eosinophils; thus, perpetuating the inflammatory response. Since activation of IL -4 and IL -13 signaling precedes the release of proinflammatory mediators, antagonism of these cytokines has the potential to reduc e the Th2 response and provide therapeutic benefit. A study was recently conducted with the aim of identifying differences and similarities between cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) +ve, polarized T -cell subsets in children versus adults with AD. In this study, peripheral blood from children less than 5 years old was compared with that of adults with well -characterized moderate -to-severe AD, using flow cytometry. The study concluded that Th2 activation within skin -homing T cells might drive AD in childre n. Moreover, the spreading to additional Th subsets, particularly Th22, is seen in adults but not in children (Czarnowicki 2015 ). Based on the results of this study, it is speculated that therapeutics that target Th2 cytokines, su ch as dupilumab, might be particularly valuable in the pediatric population with AD. There is currently a high unmet medical need for a n effective therapy for AD with an acceptable safety profile in infants and young children who suffer with moderate -to-severe AD . Nonpharmacological management of AD, which includes environmental control measures (eg, avoidance of antigen and skin irritan ts) and skin care measures (eg, maintaining the hydration of the skin through the use of emollients) play a supportive role, especially in children with moderate -to-severe disease. Pharmacological management of AD in children is mainly limited to topical therapy with topical corticosteroids (TCS) and topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs). However, long -term use of TCS in children is not recommended because of the risk of irreversible skin atrophy, dyspigmentation, acneiform eruptions, and risks associated with systemic absorption (eg, growth retardation, hypothalamic pituitary axis effects, etc). Topical calcineurin inhi bitors, such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, are also used in AD as an alternative to or in combination with TCS. However, both tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are not indicated for use in children <2 years of age. Moreover, the use of TCI is frequently asso ciated with skin irritation. Furthermore, a possible increased risk of malignancy (lymphoma and skin cancers) has been noted for TCIs . Systemic agents are used off -label in children (cyclosporine, systemic steroids, methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophe nolate mofetil).

36,page_36,"Clinical Study Protocol R668 -AD-1539 Amendment 4 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc . Page 37 CONFIDENTIAL Treatment of Severe Atopic Eczema in Children Taskforce (TREAT)” found that approximately 70% of respondents initiated systemic therapy for children with severe A D (Proudfoot 2013 ). All of these systemic agents have significant side effects in children, including stunted growth, diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis (corticosteroids), myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity (methotrexate), nephrotoxicity and hypertension (cy closporine), and gastrointestinal disturbances and leucopenia (azathioprine). Moreover, a high proportion of patients in which disease is initially controlled by systemic agents suffer from relapse soon after therapy is discontinued (Schmitt 2009 ). Type 2 inflammation (including Th2 responses) and the dysregulated activation of Th2 cells have been recognized as the key underlying disease drivers of AD and other associated atopic/allergic diseases. Targeting the key upstream type 2 c ytokines, IL -4 and IL -13, has the potential for treating the pathology of AD as well as other associated atopic/allergic diseases. Since activation of IL -4 and IL -13 signaling precedes the release of proinflammatory mediators, antagonism of these cytokine s has the potential to reduce the type 2 inflammatory responses seen in AD and other associated atopic/allergic diseases. In addition, type 2/Th2 cytokines are believed to induce altered epidermal responses, inhibit terminal differentiation proteins, and produce and/or amplify the skin barrier defect in AD; therefore, antagonism of IL -4 and IL -13 signaling has the potential to restore barrier function. Dupilumab is a novel targeted immunoregulatory agent that selectively and simultaneously inhibits IL-4 and IL-13 signaling by blocking the obligate shared component of the IL -4/IL-13 receptor complex. It is intended to inhibit key disease drivers to achieve clinical benefit without the side effects commonly observed with existing non -selective systemic immun osuppressants. Dupilumab has been approved for marketing in the US, EU , and Japan for treatment of moderate - to-severe AD in adults and adolescents. Dupilumab, given subcutaneously (SC), is currently in clinical trials for multiple indications, including treatment of moderate -to-severe AD in patients intolerant of, or whose disease is not adequately controlled with, topical treatments. As of 28 March 2019, dupilumab clinical data in AD are available from 22 completed and 6 ongoing (phase 1, 2, and 3) studies in adult healthy subjects and in patients with AD. A total of 202 healthy subjects, and 3931 patients with AD have been exposed to dupilumab in p hase 1, single -dose studies at doses up to 12 mg/kg intravenous (IV) and 600 mg SC, and phase 1 through 3 multiple -dose studies at doses up to 300 mg once a week (QW), preceded by a 600 mg loading dose. Sixteen of the 22 completed studies were conducted i n patients with AD. Data from these studies showed rapid and dose -dependent improvement in pharmacodynamic (PD) and efficacy endpoints in dupilumab -treated patients. Dupilumab has also been consistently well -tolerated across these clinical studies. Dupilumab has been studied in 2 completed studies in pediatric patients with AD. R668 -AD-1412 was a phase 2 study investigating the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and exploratory efficacy of dupilumab in patients aged ≥6 to <1 2 years with severe AD and ≥12 to <18 years with moderate -to-severe AD (77 patients were exposed to dupilumab). R668 -AD-1526 was a phase 3 study investigating the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients ≥12 to <18 years of age with moderate -to-severe AD ( 166 patient s were exposed to dupilumab). Data from these completed studies in pediatric patients with AD showed that dupilumab had an acceptable safety profile and was we ll tolerated in patients aged ≥6 to <18 years of age (see Section 1.2.3.2 ), and provided significant clinical benefit ( Section 1.2.3.1 ).

Page 38 CONFIDENTIAL In addition, dupilumab is currently being studied in 2 other ongoing pediatric studies : a phase 3 study (R668 -AD-1652) investigating the efficacy and safety of dupilumab administered concomitantly with TCS in patients 6 years t o <12 years of age with AD, and an open -label extension (OLE) study (R668 -AD-1434) to assess the long -term safety and efficacy of dupilumab in patients aged ≥6 months to <18 years with AD. Study R668 AD 1652 has completed the primary analysis period and t he OLE study R668 -AD-1434 has completed the secondary analysis period. Dupilumab has also been studied in 2 completed (EFC13579 and EFC13691) and 1 ongoing (EFC14153) phase 3 double -blind, placebo -controlled studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of du pilumab in patients, including pediatric patients, with uncontrolled asthma (see Section 1.2.3.2 ). In addition, pediatric patients aged ≥12 to <18 y ears (n=50) were included in study R668 -AD-1607 (a phase 1b actual use study of dupilumab auto -injector device in patients with AD). Completed and ongoing clinical studies with dupilumab in AD are further described in Section 1.2.3 . Additional background information on the study drug and development program can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 1.2. Rationale 1.2.1. Rationale for Study Design This study is part of the pediatric clinical development plan for dupilumab in AD. The primary purpose of the study is to provide data to support registration and labeling for the use of dupilumab in pediatric patients, 6 months to less than 6 years of ag e, suffering from moderate -to-severe AD, whose disease cannot be adequately controlled with topical medications, or for whom topical treatment is medically inadvisable (eg, intolerance, other important side effects, or safety risks). This study is a 2 -part (parts A and B) phase 2/3 study to evaluate the safety, PK and efficacy of dupilumab in patients 6 months to less than 6 years of age with moderate -to-severe AD. Part A is an open -label, single -ascending -dose, sequential cohort phase 2 study in patients ≥6 months to <6 years of age with severe AD . The primary objective of part A is to obtain safety and PK data in this patient population , to guide dose selection for part B. In part A, all patients will receive treatment with dupilumab. This approach wil l minimize the number of patients required in the study to obtain adequate dupilumab PK and safety data. The ascending dose cohort and descending age subset design in part A was chosen to allow the lower dose and older, less vulnerable age subset to be eva luated first. Review, at internal safety review meetings, of safety data from cohorts who have already been dosed before opening up a new cohort, will further ensure patient safety. Part B is a randomized, double -blind, parallel -group, placebo -controlled study in which study treatments will be administered concomitantly with topical therapy to patients . The primary objective of part B is to demonstrate efficacy of dupilumab in combination with prescription topical t herapy in pediatric patients, 6 months t o less than 6 years of age, suffering from moderate -to-severe AD.

38,page_38,"Clinical Study Protocol R668 -AD-1539 Amendment 4 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc . Page 39 CONFIDENTIAL In initial interactions with a Competent Authorit y which were held at a time when there was no data from clinical studies on the use of dupilumab in the pediatric population, the sponsor w as advised to limit the patient population to severe patients in patients <12 -years -old. Since then, dupilumab has been tested in multiple clinical studies in pediatric patients and shown to provide considerable clinical benefit to pediatric patients with an acceptable safety profile. Subgroup analysis from dupilumab phase 3 studies in both adult and adolescent patients showed comparable efficacy and safety profile patients with moderate and severe disease at baseline. Moreover, an analysis performed on p atients ≥6 to <12 years of age in the open -label extension study with a baseline disease of moderate severity (IGA=3) showed that the drug was well tolerated in this subpopulation with a comparable safety profile to the overall study population. The spons or was recently advised to broaden the patient population to moderate -to-severe disease by the United States Food and Drug Administration . This approach will maximize the number of patients that will benefit from this drug and also facilitate enrollment i n this study. An add -on study design will ensure that patients who are randomized to the placebo group will continue to receive standard treatment for their disease; an important consideration given the target population consists of infants and young child ren with moderate -to-severe disease. Moreover, this approach mirrors the therapeutic paradigm envisaged for dupilumab post approval in this age - group. Clinicians are expected to continue treatment with topical therapies upon initiation of dupilumab, and to taper use of topical treatment following onset of clinical effect of dupilumab. The 16 -week treatment duration is similar to what was used in the adult pivotal trials (R668 -AD-1416 and R668 -AD-1334). Patients were treated with dupilumab every 2 weeks [Q2W ] dose regimen for 52 weeks in another adult phase 3 study (R668 -AD-1224) and no incremental therapeutic benefit was noticed for the overall patient population between week 16 and week 52. Treatment duration of 16 weeks has been chosen because the maximum , or close to maximal, therapeutic effect for dupilumab in this patient population is expected to be achieved by this time based on data from these studies and also from R668 -AD-1526 (phase 3 study of dupilumab in adolescent patients with AD. Data gathered from the dose -range -finding study in adults (R668 -AD-1021) showed that all dosing regimens ( 100 mg every 4 weeks [ Q4W ], 200 mg QW, 200 mg Q2W, 300 mg Q2W, 300 mg Q4W ) achieved steady -state concentration on or before week 16. These findings sugges t that 16 weeks will be sufficient time for the selected doses for part B (fixed dosing tiered by body weight strata : 200 mg Q 4W [≥5-<15 kg] and 300 mg Q 4W [≥15-<30 kg]) to achieve steady -state concentration and saturation of the target -mediated pathway . The 12 -week follow -up period is based on the expected PK of dupilumab after the last dose, ie, the time for systemic concentrations to decline to non -detectable levels (below the lower limit of quantification) in most patients. The co -primary endpoints ( proportion of patients with Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) 0/1 and ≥75% improvement from baseline in Eczema Area and Severity Index [EASI] score [ EASI -75] at week 16) (proportion of patients with EASI -75 is a co -primary endpoint for EU and EU Reference Market Countries only, key secondary endpoint for US) were chosen because they are similar to those used in the adult pivotal studies (SOLO trials), and to address the va rying primary endpoint requests by differing health authorities. Eczema Area and Severity Index has been validated in the pediatric population in a prior study ( Barbier 2004 ). The approach to combine parts A and B into a single stu dy will ensure earlier availability of a potentially effective therapy in a target population with high unmet medical need.

39,page_39,"Clinical Study Protocol R668 -AD-1539 Amendment 4 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc . Page 40 CONFIDENTIAL As the efficacy and safety of dupilumab for the treatment of AD has not yet been established in patients ≥6 months to <6 years, a p lacebo control is a scientifically essential element of the study design to enable adequate assessment and interpretation of the treatment effect and safety profile. It is particularly relevant for pediatric patients, in whom spontaneous remission of AD o ver time has been described. Several features of the protocol are intended to mitigate any potential concerns in patients randomized to the placebo group: • Mandatory requirement for use of concomitant TCS − Starting on day -14 (applicable to part B only) , all patients will initiate a standardized TCS treatment regimen with a low-potency TCS that may be adjusted based on clinical response (see Section 5.2). Topical corticosteroids represent the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment of AD and have been shown to have some benefit even in a patient population selected for their inadequate response to TCS. • Availability of rescue treatment − Patients who experienc e AD exacerbations or intolerable symptoms may receive rescue treatment with a range of treatments available to all patients with AD: medium or high-potency TCS, systemic corticosteroids, nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs , and TCI (see Section 5.3). • Open -Label Extension (OLE) Study − Patients who complete the treatment period of part B (week 16) will be offered an opportunity to screen for t he OLE study at end -of-treatment (EOT) visit. Additional details concerning eligibility for the OLE can be found in Section 5.8. As described in Se ction 3.3.1 , an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), will monitor patient safety by conducting formal reviews of accumulated safety data on a program -wide level. 1.2.2. Rationale for Dose Selection In the adult phase 3 studies (SOLO -1 and SOLO -2, both studies had identical study designs), patients were randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups: dupilumab 300 mg SC QW, dupilumab 300 mg SC Q2W, or place bo for 16 weeks following an initial dupilumab loading dose of 600 mg SC, or placebo. Both dose regimens of 300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W provided significant clinical benefit and had an acceptable safety profile. For the 16 -week treatment period, the overall rate of adverse events ( AEs) (65% to 73% dupilumab and 65% to 72% placebo) was comparable between the dupilumab and the placebo groups. The rate of serious adverse events (SAEs) was 1% to 3% for dupilumab and 5% to 6% for placebo. Serious and severe inf ections were also numerically higher in the placebo groups in both studies (0.5% to 1 % dupilumab and 2% to 3% placebo). Assuming an average adult body weight of 75 kg, a dose of 4 mg/kg would be equivalent to 300 mg and would seem to provide matching dose levels in children. However, PK parameters, like clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (V), do not scale linearly with body weight for younger children ( Zhang 2015 ). Therefore, the reductions of CL and V in children are le ss than weight - proportional.

Page 41 CONFIDENTIAL Given this background, a dose of 6 mg/kg in pediatric patients is expected to provide an exposure similar to a single dose of 300 mg in adult patients. This is supported by PK simulations using a PK model developed with data from adult AD patients and from pediatric AD patients in study R668 -AD-1412 (A phase 2 study investigating the safety, PK, immunogenicity, and exploratory efficacy of dupilumab in patients aged ≥6 to <18 years with AD). As part of the ascending -dose sequential cohort design, the dose regimen of 3 mg/kg was chosen as the initial starting dose to first evaluate the safety of dupilumab at the l ower dose before progressing to the higher, 6 mg/kg, dose cohort. The first study with dupilumab in pediatric patients 6 to 17 years of age (R668 -AD-1412) evaluated doses of 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg. A review of the data from this study showed that these dose s were well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile , in addition to showing some clinical benefit. A dose of 3 mg/kg in patients 6 months to <6 years of age is expected to provide exposure lower than that seen with a dose of 4 mg/kg in patients 12 to 17 years of age in study R668 -AD-1412. In study R668 -AD-1412, a trend for a higher incidence of persistent anti -drug antibodies (ADAs) was seen in the lower dose cohorts (2 mg/kg) compared to the higher dose cohorts (4 mg/kg). A lower dose is typically mo re immunogenic than a larger dose ( European Medicines Agency 2007 , Food and Drug Administration 2014 ) and the use of high -dose monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has been shown to reduce immunogenicity and induce to lerance through exhaustion of the immune response (Maini 1998 ). Given this background, a starting dose of 3 mg/kg is expected to lower the likelihood of an immune response compared to a 2 mg/kg dose. In part A of the current study ( R668 -AD-1539), 20 patients in the age group ≥2 to <6 years and 20 patients in the age group ≥6 months to <2 years were enrolled. S ingle -dose treatm ent with dupilumab 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg led to reduction in both signs (as measured by percent reduction in EASI score from baseline, proportion of patients achieving ≥50% improvement from baseline in EASI score [ EASI -50]) and symptoms (as measured by percent reduction in pruritus numeric rating scale [NRS] from baseline) of AD. Mean body weight was 17.1 kg in the ≥2 to <6 years of age and 9.8 kg in the ≥ 6 months -<2 years age group . • In the ≥2 to <6 years of age group, single doses of 3 mg/kg SC dupilumab provided a mean reduction from base line in EASI score of 44.6% at week 3 and 26.6% at week 4 and single doses of 6 mg/kg SC dupilumab provided a mean reduction of 49.7% at week 3 and 48.7% at week 4. • In the ≥6 months to <2 years of age group, single doses of 3 mg/kg SC dupilumab provided a mean reduction from baseline in EASI score of 42.7% at week 3 and 22.4% at week 4 and single doses of 6 mg/kg SC dupilumab provided a mean reduction of 38.8 % at week 3 and 4 3.2% at week 4. Single -dose treatment with dupilumab 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg had an acceptable safety profile and was well tolerated in both age groups. The dupilumab treatment group in part B of the current study is a weight -tiered fixed -dose regimen of 200 mg Q4W SC for children with a baseline body weight ≥5 to <15 kg and 300 mg Q4W SC for children with a baseline body weight ≥15 to <30 kg.

41,page_41,"Clinical Study Protocol R668 -AD-1539 Amendment 4 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc . Page 42 CONFIDENTIAL The dose regimen of 300 mg Q4W was evaluated in pediatric patients ≥6 to <12 years of age with severe AD in the ongoing phase 3 study, R668 -AD-1652 , which included 61 patients in the ≥15 to <30 kg weight range. In the primary analysis completed at the end of the treatment period, the 300 mg Q4W dose regimen led to clinically relevant and statistically significant reduction in both signs and symptoms of AD. In the ≥15 kg to <30 kg weight ran ge: • Approximately 30% of patients achieved an IGA score of 0/1 ( total n=61) in the 300 mg Q4W treatment group compared to 13% patients for the same weight category in the placebo group ( total n=63). Similarly, 75% of patients achieved an EASI -75 in the 30 0 mg Q4W treatment group compared to 28% patients in the placebo group. • Approximately 55% of patients achieved an NRS reduction ≥4 points in the 300 mg Q4W treatment group compared to 12% of patients in the placebo group. The 300 mg Q4W regimen was shown t o have an acceptable safety profile and was well tolerated in these patients , supporting use of the same doses in younger AD patients with similar body weights . The doses selected for part B of the study were based on PK data gathered from part A (patient s ≥2 years to <6 years of age or ≥6 months to <2 years of age) and integrated in a population PK model for pediatric patients with observations in patients ≥6 to <12 years of age or ≥12 to <18 years of age. Supporting PK simulations using this pediatric population PK model are summarized below. The goal of dose selection for part B was to achieve dupilumab exposure in pediatric patients at steady -state equivalent to exposure in adults where tolerability and efficacy have been demonstrated. In adults, d upilumab regimens of 300 mg Q2W and QW were both shown to be well tolerated and efficacious in Phase 3 studies. Hence , various weight -tiered regimens were simulated using an established population PK model with the aim of selecting pediatric regimens that 1) achieved a distribution (5th, median, and 95th percentile) of C trough ,ss (lowest concentration in a dosing interval at steady -state) that was similar to or greater than that of the standard 300 mg Q2W regimen in adults and 2) for which predicated maxim um concentrations at steady -state (Cmax, ss) did not exceed the Cmax,ss obtained with the 300 mg QW regimens in adults . The predicted 5th percentile of C trough,ss for 200 mg Q4 W SC in children ≥5 to <15 kg and 300 mg Q4W SC in children ≥15 to <30 kg were similar to the 5th percentile of C trough,ss for adult and adolescent Q2W concentrations. The predicted 95th percentile of C max,ss of 200 mg Q4 W SC in children ≥5 to <15 kg and 300 mg Q4W in children ≥15 to <30 kg did not exceed the adult 300 mg QW C max, ss.

Benefits The efficacy of dupilumab was evaluated in multiple randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled studies in adults . In addition, the efficacy of dupilumab was evaluated in separate randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled studies carried out in adolescents and in pediatric patients ≥6 to <12 years old. In each of these studies, dupilumab demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements compared to placebo in disease activity measures assessing objective AD signs (IGA, EASI, SCORing Atopic Dermatitis [ SCORAD ], body surface area [ BSA ] affected by A D), subjective symptoms (eg, Pruritus NRS, Patient Oriented Eczema Measure [ POEM ]), and quality of life ( Dermatology Life Quality Index [ DLQI ] in adults, Childrens’ Dermatology Life Quality Index [ CDLQI ] in adolescents and patients ≥6 to <12 years old ). These results formed the basis for approval of dupiluma b for moderate -to-severe AD in adults worldwide, and in adolescents in US and EU . A first-step analysis was conducted on data (data cutoff of 21 Apr 2018) from adolescent patients (≥12 to <18 years o ld) enrolled in the OLE study, R668 -AD-1434. The results of this first -step analysis support the long -term efficacy of dupilumab in adolescent patients with moderate -to-severe AD. A second -step analysis was conducted on data (data cutoff of 22 Jul 2019) from pediatric patients ≥6 to <12 years of age enrolled in the OLE study, R668 -AD-1434. The results of this second -step analysis support the long -term efficacy of dupilumab in patients ≥6 to <12 years of age with AD. Based on data available to date for part A of the current study, single -dose treatment with dupilumab 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg provide d clinical benefit for both signs and symptoms in patients ≥2 to <6 years , as well as patients ≥6 months to <2 years , of age with severe AD (see Section 1.2.2 ). 1.2.3.2. Risks The most common adverse drug reactions identified in the dupilumab adult AD clinical program were injection site reactions common (≥10%). Other c ommon adverse reactions (≥1% and <10%) included conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, eye pruritus, blepharitis, oral herpes, and eosinophilia. In the completed adolescent AD studies and in the ongoing study in patients ≥6 to <12 years old , the safety profile was consistent with that repor ted in adults and t here were no new safety signals detected with dupilumab in the adolescent population. An acceptable safety profile has also been demonstrated in adolescent patients enrolled in the asthma study EFC13579 (n=107). The results of the first -step analysis of adolescent OLE study R668 -AD-1434 also showed that long-term treatment with dupilumab was well tolerated in adolescent patients, with a long -term safety profile similar to that of adolescent patients treated with dupilumab for shorter dur ations. The results of the second -step analysis of the OLE study R668 -AD-1434 also showed that long-term treatment with dupilumab was well tolerated in pedia tric patients ≥6 to <12 years old, with a long -term safety profile similar to that of adolescent patients treated with dupilumab for a similar duration.

Page 44 CONFIDENTIAL In part A of the current study, single -dose treatment with dupilumab 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg appear ed to be well tolerated in patients aged ≥2 to <6 years. The incidence of TEAEs was comparable in patients in the 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg dose groups (3/10 [30%] and 2/10 [20%] , respectively ). None of these events w as severe . One patient had a serious TEAE of anaphylactic reaction. This event was assessed as no t related to dupilumab , as an alternate cause for the event was present (history of allergy to nuts and patient had consumed nuts just prior to onset of event). Moreover, in part A of the current study, single -dose treatment with dupilumab 3 mg/kg or 6 mg/kg also appeared to be well tolerated in patients aged ≥6 months to <2 years. The incidence of TEAEs was comparable in patients in the 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg dose arms (7/10 [70%] for each treatment regimen). The only TEAE that was reported in >2 patients w as nasopharyngitis. One patient had a serious TEAE of anaphylactic reaction, which was assessed as not related to dupilumab as an alternate cause for the event was present (had consumed shell fish [crab] just prior to onset of event). Overall, systemic hy persensitivity has been established as an important identified risk with dupilumab. As protein therapeutics, all monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are potentially immunogenic. Rare serious and systemic hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in the dupilumab program including s erum sickness /serum sickness -like reaction in the adult AD and anaphylaxis related to dupilumab in the adult asthma clinical studies . No event of serum sickness/serum sickness -like reaction or anaphylaxis related to dupilumab has been reported in the adolescent AD program. In study R668 -AD-1539, patients will be monitored at the study center for 2 hours post -dose for the first 3 visits at which study drug is administered to facilitate detection and treatment of any immediate hypersensitivity reactions to the study drug. An important potential risk “Eosinophilia associated with clinical sympto ms” has been observed in the asthma clinical trials (few cases of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and eosinophilic pneumonia) but not in AD clinical studies. Nonclinical repeat -dose toxicity studies and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not identified any general or reproductive toxicology or postnatal effects of anti -IL-4 receptor subunit alpha (anti -IL-4Rα) surrogate antibodies in cynomolgus monkeys and mice. These nonclinical data, together with the clinical safety profi le of dupilumab to date, support the evaluation of dupilumab in pediatric patients. 1.2.3.3. Risk/Benefit Conclusion The safety data and the clinical benefit of dupilumab demonstrated in part A of this study as well as in multiple AD studies in adult , adolescent , and pediatric (≥6 to <12 years of age) patients , support a favorable benefit -risk profile for dupilumab.

Study cohorts will only be used in part A of the study. Two sequential age cohorts are planned in part A: age cohort 1 (≥2 to <6 yrs. old) and age cohort 2 (≥6 months to <2 yrs. old). Within each age cohort, approximately 10 patients will be enrolled in each of the 2 dose sub -cohorts: sub -cohort A (3 mg/kg) and sub -cohort B (6 mg/kg). Enrollment and stud y dosing will start with cohort 1A (≥2 to <6 yrs. old, 3 mg/kg dose, n=10). Following sa fety review of data from cohort 1A, enrollment will start in both cohort 1B (≥2 to <6 yrs. old, 6 mg/kg dose, n=10) and cohort 2A (≥6 months to <2 yrs. old, 3 mg/kg dose, n=10) (see details in Section 3.1.2 and Figure 4). Following safety review of data from cohort 2A, enrollment will start in cohort 2B (≥6 months to <2 yrs. old, 6 mg/kg dose, n=10). To ensure adequate representation of patients from all ag e-groups, a cap will be placed on the number of patients that will be enrolled in each of the dose sub -cohorts (3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg) as follows: Cohorts 1A and 1B: • 2 years to <4 years of age: 7 patients • 4 years to <6 years of age: 7 patients Cohorts 2A and 2B: • 6 months to <1 year of age: 7 patients • 1 year to <2 years of age: 7 patients Part A of the study will consist of a screening period (day -35 to day -1), a baseline visit (day 1), a single -dose treatment followed by a 4 -week PK sampling period ( Figure 2), and an additional 4-week follow -up period (only for patients who decline to participate a subsequent OLE study). After informed consent is provide d by patients’ parents or legal guardians, patients will be assessed for study eligibility at the screening visit. Patients may be rescreened if they fail the screening evaluation for reasons related to incidental transitory conditions, unless the reason for the screen failure is related to failing the inclusion criteria for disease severity. Patients who meet eligibility criteria will undergo baseline assessments and then proceed to part A to receive their single dose of study treatment on day 1 and unde rgo functional dupilumab PK sample collection during the following 4 weeks for characterizing the single -dose PK profile. All patients will be offered an opportunity to participate in an OLE study at week 4. Patients who decline will be followed up for a n additional 4 weeks (total of 8 weeks). This will ensure a sufficient follow -up period for these patients and will maximize patient safety. Concomitant use of TCS with or without TCIs will be permitted during part A of the study, including the screening period (Section 5.2). Investigators will be instructed to standardize the use of topical steroids to medium, and/or low potency, and ensure that the use of TCS is consistent with product labels.

The DERC will meet at the following pre -defined time points: 1. When all of the patients enrolled in cohort 1A have completed the week 4 (day 29) safety assessments 2. When all of the patients enrolled in cohort 2A have completed the week 4 (day 29) safety assessments During these meetings, the DERC will review all available safety data from completed cohorts. This will include data on AEs (including SAEs and adverse events of special interest [AESIs]), vital signs, and laboratory values. The DERC will monitor AEs including, but not limited to, serious infections, severe injection site reactions, systemic immune reactions like hypersensitivity and severe conju nctivitis. Dose escalation to the next cohort will not immediately proceed if the following occurs: • If 2 or more patients in a cohort experience a severe AE that is deemed related to study drug by the investigator If this occurs, the DERC will evaluate all of the available safety information and inform senior scientific leadership at Regeneron who will make the final recommendation on dose escalation to the next cohort. For other unanticipated safety findings, the DERC, at their discretion, may defer to the senior scientific leadership at Regeneron for the decision on dose -escalation to the next cohort. In addition to the pre -defined time points mentioned above, DERC will also meet on an ad -hoc basis if the following occurs: • A treatment -emergent SAE occurs t hat is assessed by the investigator or the sponsor to be related to dupilumab treatment In this instance, a comprehensive review of the data gathered from the patient(s) in whom the SAE(s) occurred will be performed. In addition, review of all safety data gathered from the study available at the time of the meeting will be performed. Based on this review, DERC will inform senior scientific leadership at Regeneron who will make the final recommendation on whether to continue the study as planned, or to ter minate the study.

Instru ctions on dose preparation are provided in the pharmacy manual. 5.2. Background Treatments Background treatment will only be required to be used by patients in part B of the study. In part B of the study, all patients are required to have moisturizers (emollients) applied at least twice daily for at least the 7 consecutive days immediately before randomization (does not include day of randomization ). At least 11 of the 14 total applications must be applied for the patient to remain eligibl e for the study. Patients are to continue to have moisturizers applied throughout the remainder of the study (all 28 weeks where applicable). However, to allow adequate assessment of skin dryness, moisturizers should not be applied for at least 8 hours b efore each clinic visit. All types of moisturizers are permitted, but patients may not initiate treatment with prescription moisturizers or moisturizers containing additives during the screening period or during the study. Patients may continue using sta ble doses of such moisturizers if initiated before the screening visit. Starting on day -14, all patients in part B are required to initiate treatment with TCS using a standardized regimen according to the following guidelines: • Apply low potency TCS once daily to areas with active lesions. Based on investigator discretion, low/mild potency TCS may also be used on areas of thin skin (face, neck, intertriginous, and genital areas, areas of skin atrophy, etc.). • Once the patient achieves an IGA score of 2 o r less, lower frequency of use of low potency TCS to 3 times per week, and then stop once lesions are clear (IGA=0) . Patients should be instructed to only use TCS on active lesions, and to stop use of TCS if lesions clear completely in between clinic visi ts. • If lesions return, reinstitute treatment with low potency TCS, with the same step -down approach described above upon lesion resolution. • For lesions persisting or worsening under daily treatment with low potency TCS, patients may be treated (rescued) wi th medium or high potency TCS (super potent TCS are not allowed to be used, even as rescue, see Section 5.3). The use of medium or high potency TCS as rescue is only allowed after day 14. A medium or high potency TCS should normally be restricted to use on non -delicate skin sites (excluding face, flexures, groin), and should not be used for a prolonged period in order to prevent the development of cutaneous atrophy and adrenal axis suppression. Low potency steroids should normally be used for delicate skin sites (face, flexures, groin) during the se flares. Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be used for rescue, alone or in combination with TCS, but the use of TCIs should be reserved for problem areas only (eg, face, neck, intertriginous, and genital areas, etc).

The use of TCS should be consistent with the product label. The use of very high potency or super potent TCS is prohibited during the study, as their use is not recommended in patients under 12 years of age. If patients have tolerance issues with any of these steroids, and/or to the excipients in a particular formulation (eg, hypersensitivity), or if the y are not commercially available in some countries, they may substitute with products of the same potency from the list provided in the investigator site binder . It is required that patients use hydrocortisone acetate 1% cream for low potency (hydrocortisone 1% cream can be used in case the acetate salt is not available) . Only in case of known side effects to hydrocortisone 1%/ hydrocortisone acetate 1% cream ( eg, for hypersensitivity) or in case of non -availability due to any reason, other l ow potency TCS such as alclometasone dipropionate 0.05% cream or desonide 0.05% cream can be used . If rescue with TCS is needed, it is recommended that patients use triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% ointment for medium potency . Other medium to high potency TCS can be used as per investigator discretion . (Please refer to Appendix 2 for a list of such agents) . • It is required that moisturizers be applied twice daily during the 7 consecutive days immediately before randomization (does not include day of randomization ) and patients are to continue to apply moisturizers throughout the study (once in the morning and once in the evening). A 60 -minute interval betwee n the application of emollients and TCS is recommended wherever applicable. • Patients will return TCS tubes at each clinic visit through week 16, and these tubes will be weighed by the site staff to determine the actual amount of TCS used. 5.3. Rescue Treatments Rescue treatment for worsening of AD may be provided to study patients at the discretion of the investigator in parts A and B of the study. The use of rescue treatment is only allowed after day 14 of the study in part B . Investigators will be required to perform an IGA assessment prior to starting rescue treatment and initiate rescue treatment only in patients who either have an IGA score ≥3 or have intolerable symptoms. If possible, investigators are encouraged to consid er rescue initially with topical treatment (eg, medium or high potency TCS) and to escalate to systemic medications only for patients who do not respond adequately after at least 7 days of topical treatment. Topical calcineurin inhibitors may be used for rescue, alone or in combination with TCS, but the use of TCIs should be reserved for problem areas only (eg, face, neck, intertriginous, and genital areas, etc). Investigators may also consider rescue with crisaborole. Rescue treatment for these topical therapies should be used as per prescribing information and local guidelines. Patients may continue study treatment if rescue consists of topical medications. Patients who receive systemic corticosteroids or systemic non -steroid immunosuppressive drugs (eg, cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate -mofetil, azathioprine, etc) as rescue medication during part B of the study, will be discontinued permanently from the study drug. All patients will be asked to complete the scheduled study visits and assessmen ts whether or not they complete study treatment and whether or not they receive rescue treatment for AD. Investigators should make every attempt to conduct efficacy and safety assessments (eg, disease severity scores, safety laboratory tests) immediately before administering any rescue treatment. An unscheduled visit may be used for this purpose, if necessary. For the purpose of the efficacy responder analysis, a VV-RIM-00131070-1.0 Approved - 28 Oct 2020 GMT-5:00"

Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug Study drug dosing will be permanently discontinued in the event of: • Anaphylactic reaction or other severe systemic reaction to the study drug • Diagnosis of a malignancy during study • Any infection that is opportunistic, such as active tuberculosis and other infections whose nature or course may suggest an immuno -compromised status • Severe laboratory abnormalities: − Neutrophil count ≤0.5×103 µL − Platelet count ≤50×103 µL − ALT and/or AST values greater than 3×ULN with total bilirubin >2×ULN (unless elevated bilirubin is related to confirmed Gilbert's Syndrome) − Confirmed AST and/or ALT >5×ULN (fo r more than 2 weeks) NOTE: If the laboratory abnormality is considered causally related to study drug, study treatment will be permanently discontinued. In cases in which a causal relationship to study drug can be reasonably excluded, (ie, an alternative cause is evident), study treatment will be discontinued but it may be resumed when the laboratory abnormality is sufficiently normalized. A decision to resume study treatment will be made jointly by the investigator and medical monitor (medical monitor's written approval is required).

The use of very high potency or super potent TCS is not allowed throughout the study (as their use is not recommended in patients under 12 years of age). However, medium or high-potency TCS, TCIs, and crisaborole can be used as rescue treatment (see Section 5.3). In this situation, the study drug may be continued. Patients who receive systemic corticosteroids or systemic non -steroid immunosuppressive drugs (eg, cyclosporine, methotrexa te, mycophenolate -mofetil, azathioprine, etc) as rescue medication during part B of the study, will be discontinued permanently from the study drug. 5.4.2.2. Reasons for Temporary Discontinuation of Study Drug Study drug dosing will be temporarily discontinued in the event of: • Clinically important laboratory abnormalities, such as: − ALT or AST >3×ULN and ≤5xULN − Neutrophils ≤1.0×103/µL, but >0.5×103/µL for patients <1 year of age; Neutrophils ≤1.5×103/µL, but >0.5×103/µL for patients 1 year to <6 years of age − Platel et count ≤100× 103/µL but >50×103/µL − Eosinophils >5000/µL − CPK > 2.5×ULN − Serum creatinine >1.5× ULN • Other intercurrent illnesses or major surgery • An infection that requires parenteral treatment or oral treatment for longer than 2 weeks with antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, or antiprotozoal agents After the condition leading to suspension of dosing normalizes sufficiently, study treatment may resume at the discretion of the principal investigator in consultation with the medical monitor. A decision to discontinue study drug and/or to reinstitute study treatment should be discussed with the medical monitor. The investigator may suspend study treatment at any time, even without consultation with the medical monitor, if the urgency of the s ituation requires immediate action and if this is determined to be in the patient's best interest. However, the medical monitor should be contacted as soon as possible in any case of study drug discontinuation. Resumption of study treatment after tempora ry discontinuation should always be discussed with the medical monitor. VV-RIM-00131070-1.0 Approved - 28 Oct 2020 GMT-5:00"

Method of Treatment Assignment Part A of the study is open -label; all patients will receive dupilumab. To ensure adequate representation of patients from all age -groups, a cap will be placed on the number of patients that will be enrolled in each of the dose sub -cohorts (3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg) as follows: cohorts 1A and 1B : 2 years to <4 years of age: 7 patie nts; 4 years to <6 years of age: 7 patients; cohorts 2A and 2B : 6 months to <1 year of age: 7 patients; 1 year to <2 years of age: 7 patients. Part B of the study is a randomized, double -blind, parallel group, placebo -controlled study in which approximatel y 160 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio stratified by baseline weight (≥5-<15 kg and ≥15 -<30 kg), baseline disease severity (IGA=3, 4), and region /country (North America, Europe, Japan, and China ) to receive 1 of the following 2 treatment regimens . • dupilumab Q4W tiered fixed -dose (200 mg for patients ≥5 -<15 kg or 300 mg for patients ≥ 15-<30 kg) regimen • placebo Q4W regimen Randomization will be performed according to a central randomization scheme provided by an IWRS to the designated study pharmacist (or qualified designee). Randomization slots will be reserved for patients from Japan and China in the I WRS. The number of patients with moderate AD (IGA=3) will be capped at approximately 40. 5.5.1. Blinding Part A of the study is open -label, therefore blinding procedures will not be implemented. Part B of the study, except for IDMC members and the provisions specified in Section 5.5.2 , will remain blinded to all individuals until the prespecified unmasking to conduct the primary analyses. Blinded study drug kits coded with a medication numbering system will be used in part B. In order to maintain the blind, lists linking these codes with product lot numbers will not be accessible to individuals involved in study conduct. Anti-drug antibody and drug concentration results will not be communicated to the sites, and the sponso r’s operational team will not have access to results associated with patient identification until after the final database lock. 5.5.2. Emergency Unblinding In part B of the study, unblinding of treatment assignment for a patient may be necessary due to a medical emergency, an SAE that is unexpected and for which a causal relationship to the study drug cannot be ruled out, or for any other significant medical event. • If unblinding is required in part B: − Only the investigator will make the decision to unmask the tre atment assignment. − Only the affected patient will be unmasked. − The IWRS will provide the treatment assignment to the investigator. − The investigator will notify Regeneron and/or designee immediately that the patient has been unmasked .

Childrens’ Dermatology Life Quality Index The CDLQI is a validated questionnaire designed to measure the impact of skin disease on the QOL in children ≥4 years of age ( Lewis -Jones 1995 ). The aim of the questionnaire is to measure how much a patient’s skin problem has affected the patient over a recall period of the past week. A cartoon version of the CDLQI will be administered to patients 4 to 5 years of age, with the assistance of a parent or adult “as necessary”. If assistance of parent or adult caregiver is required, it is recommended that the same person assist the patient throughout the study. The cartoon version of the CDLQI uses th e same text and scoring system as the original CDLQI but includes 10 color drawings of a dog illustrating the theme of each question. To complete the questionnaire, patients need to provide responses to 10 questions (the questions focus on domains such as symptoms feelings associated with disease, the impact of the disease on leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep, and side effects of treatment for the skin disease. The instrument has a recall period of 7 days. Nine of the 10 questions are scored as follows: • Very much = 3 • Quite a lot = 2 • Only a little = 1 • Not at all = 0 • Question unanswered = 0 Question 7 has an additional possible response (prevented school), which is assigned a score of 3. The CDLQI for a patient is the sum of the score of each question with a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the greater the impact is on the QOL. The CDLQI can also be expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score of 30. This assessment will only be performed in part B at time points according to Section 6.1, Table 2 (Part B). The CDLQI is provided in the investigator site binder . 6.2.2.8. Infants’ Dermatology Quality of Life Index The IDQOL is a validated questionnaire developed to measure the impact of skin disease on the QOL of infants and preschool children <4 ye ars of age ( Lewis -Jones 2001 ). The IDQOL is to be completed by the child’s parent or caregiver. It is recommended that the same person complete the questionnaire on behalf of the patient throughout the study. The questionnaire consists of 10 questions related to itching and scratching; mood of the child; how long it takes for the child to get to sleep; whether the eczema has interfered with the child’s playing, swimming or participation in other family activities; problems durin g mealtimes; problems caused by treatment; level of comfort while dressing or undressing the child; and problems during bathing. Each question asks about the impact over the previous week and is scored on a scale of 0 (minimum impact) to 3 (maximum impact ). The IDQOL for a patient is the sum of the score of each question with a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the greater the impact is on the QOL. The IDQOL can also be expressed as a percentage of the maximum possible score of 30. VV-RIM-00131070-1.0 Approved - 28 Oct 2020 GMT-5:00"

The DFI was the first instrument assessing the impact of having a child with AD on family QOL (Lawson 1998 ). The 10 -item disease specific questionnaire was formed after ethnographical interviews and focus groups revealed the areas of fami ly QOL affected by AD. The self - administered instrument is completed by an adult family member of a child affected by dermatitis. It is recommended that the same person complete the questionnaire on behalf of the patient throughout the study. The items inquire about housework, food preparation, sleep, family leisure activity, shopping, expenditure, tiredness, emotional distress, relationships and the impact of helping with treatment on the primary caregiver’s life. The DFI questions are scored on a four - point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3, so that the total DFI score ranges from 0 to 30. The time frame of reference is the past week. A higher DFI score indicates greater impairment in family QOL as affected by AD. This assessment will only be performed in part B at time points according to Section 6.1, Table 2 (Part B). The DFI questionnaire is provided in the investigator site binder . 6.2.2.10. Patient -Oriented Eczema Measure An observation reported outcome (ObsRO) version of the POEM was developed simultaneously with the patient reported ou tcome (PRO) version and will be used here. The ObsRO version is identical to the PRO version except that it asks about “your child’s skin” rather than “your skin”. The POEM is a 7 -item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess disease symptoms in children and adults ( Charman 2004 ). The format is a response to 7 items (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping) based on frequency of these disease symptoms during the past week (ie, 0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = all days) with a scoring system of 0 to 28; the total score reflects disease -related morbidity. The questionnaire will only be administered in part B to parents/caregi vers at time points according to Section 6.1, Table 2 (Part B). It is recommended that the same person complete the questionnaire on behalf of the patient throughout the study. The POEM is provided in the investigator site binder. 6.2.2.11.

Eczema Area and Severity Index The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD ( Hanifin 2001 ). The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72. Four AD disease characteristics (erythema, thickness [induration, papulation, edema], scratching [excoriation], and lichenification) will each be assessed for severity by the investigator o r designee on a scale of “0” (absent) through “3” (severe). In young children, the head and neck (H), upper extremities (U), trunk (T), and lower extremities (L) are assigned proportionate body surface areas of 20% (H), 20% (U), 30% (T), and 30% (L), roug hly consistent with the ‘rule of nines”. In addition, the area of AD involvement will be assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs, and converted to a score of 0 to 6. In each body region, the area is expressed as 0, 1 (1% to 9%), 2 (10% to 29%), 3 (30% to 49%), 4 (50% to 69%), 5 (70% to 89%), or 6 (90% to 100%).

SCORing Atopic Dermatitis The SCORAD is a validated tool used in clinical research and clinical practice that was developed to standardize the evaluation of the extent and s everity of AD ( European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis 1993 ). There are 3 components to the assessment: A = extent or affected BSA, B = severity, and C = subjective symptoms. The extent of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area (see Section 6.2.2.13 ) and reported as the sum of all areas, with a maximum score of 100% (assigned as “A” in the overall SCORAD calc ulation). The severity of 6 specific symptoms of AD (redness, swelling, oozing/crusting, excoriation, skin thickening/lichenification, and dryness) is assessed using the following scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of 18 total points, assigned as “B” in the overall SCORAD calculation). Subjective assessment of itch and sleeplessness is recorded for each symptom by the parent/caregiver or relative on a Visual Analogue Scale, where 0 is no itch (or sleeplessness) and VV-RIM-00131070-1.0 Approved - 28 Oct 2020 GMT-5:00"

The SCORAD is calculated as: A/5 + 7B/2 + C where the maximum is 103. Patients will undergo this ass essment at time points according to Section 6.1, Table 1 (Part A), and Table 2 (Part B). The SCORAD assessment tool is provided in the investiga tor site binder. NOTE: For the purpose of assessing the extent of disease (A), the proportion assigned to different body regions is different in children <2 years of age, as compared to older children. Refer to the SCORAD assessment tool in the investigat or site binder for details. 6.2.2.16. Atopic Dermatitis Area Photographs At select study sites in part B, photographs will be taken of a representative area (s) of AD involvement (eg, the lesional area (s) used for SCORAD assessments on day 1/baseline [predose]). Subsequent photographs of the same area (s) will be taken at time points according to Section 6.1, Table 2 (Part B). Instructions for taking the photographs are provided in the photography reference manual. 6.2.2.17. Topical Corticosteroids Accountability In part B, at every in -clinic visit following the ba seline visit, the type, amount, and potency of TCS used will be recorded by site personnel. The amount of TCS used will be determined by weighing the tube at each visit through the end of the study. In addition, caregivers will be asked to record TCS use daily, from start of 2-week TCS standardization period on day -14 through the end of the study, on a n e-diary: • Use of TCS (yes/no) • Why did you not apply the topical corticosteroid to your child today? 6.2.2.18. Pediatric Asthma Symptom Questionnaire The PAS Q is a qu estionnaire developed by the sponsor to monitor asthma control in preschool children in clinical trial settings . The advantage of the PA SQ is the much shorter recall period for various items to fit the schedule of clinical trials and improvement in ability to recall as compared to existing instruments . The questionnaire consists of 6 questions related to asthma control , The questionnaire will be completed only for the subset of patients with ongoing asthma. It is to be completed by the child’s parent or caregiver who fluently speak a language in which the questionnaire is presented, at time points according to Section 6.1, Table 2 (Part B).

Ophthalmological Examinations ( Part B only) Patients who have history of certain eye disorders (conjunctivitis, blepharitis or keratitis) within 12 months prior to the screening vi sit will be referred to an ophthalmologist (preferably with expertise in treating pediatric patients or Cornea and External Eye Disease [‘front -of-the-eye’] subspecialty expert). Any baseline findings will be documented as part of the patient’s medical history and/or physical exam, as appropriate. Patients who experience AESIs related to eye disorders (refer to Section 7.2.3 ) will also be referred to an ophthalmologist (preferably with expertise in treating pediatric patients or Cornea and External Eye Disease [‘front -of-the-eye’] subspecialty expert). Further e valuation of these AESIs will be performed including any additional tests, if applicable, as per the discretion of the ophthalmologist. An ophthalmology examination form will be provided to patients by the site, which they will carry to the ophthalmologis t on the day of examination. This form will be completed by the ophthalmologist and this information will be transcribed into the study CRFs. Appropriate treatment for these AEs will be prescribed by the ophthalmologist. The investigator may also have a conversation with the ophthalmologist to discuss the further course of action for these patients . 6.2.4. Pharmacokinetic and Antibody Procedures 6.2.4.1. Drug Concentration Measurements and Samples Serum samples for measuring functional dupilumab concentrations will be c ollected at time points listed in Section 6.1, Table 1 (Part A), and Table 2 (Part B). 6.2.4.2. Immunogenicity Measurements and Samples Serum samples for ADA assessment will be collected at time points listed in Section 6.1, Table 1 (Part A) and Table 2 (Part B). Samples positive in the ADA assay will be analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibody in the NAb assay. Long term follow -up of patients who are ADA positive at their last study visit (early termination or end of study) and who do not participate in the OLE study may be considered based on the overall clinical presentat ion at that time. Patients who are considered for follow -up may be asked to return to the clinic to have additional samples collected for analysis. 6.2.5. Biomarker Procedures Thymus and activation -regulated chemokine and total serum IgE are markers of Th2 activ ity as downstream mediators in the IL -4/IL-13 signaling pathway ( Wirnsberger 2006 , Takeda 1997 ). These analytes will be assessed as measures of Th2 activity and PD effect of dupilumab. The results may be used for modeling dupilumab activity with drug levels in the comparison of dosing regimens. Thymus and activation -regulated chemokine levels have also been closely associated with AD disease activity and severity ( Beck 2014 ) and will b e evaluated as an exploratory marker of efficacy. These markers may also be assessed for their potential value in predicting treatment response. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels have also been shown to correlate with disease severity and activity in pat ients with AD ( Mukai 1990 ). VV-RIM-00131070-1.0 Approved - 28 Oct 2020 GMT-5:00"

Vaccine Response - Optional Humoral immune responses to standard vaccines administered as part of the routine immunization schedule occurring during treatment with dupilumab, will be evaluated fo r those patients eligible for these vaccinations in part B of the study. Parents/caregivers will be encouraged to provide vaccination plans at screening for any vaccines that are planned to be administered to the patient, in accordance with the patient’s a ge, local medical practice and immunization schedule, during the study. Inactivated vaccines are permitted during the study. Live attenuated vaccines are excluded during the study. Parents or legal guardians who agree for their child to participate in t he optional vaccine response sub -study will be required to sign a separate vaccine -response sub -study ICF for the collection of 2 blood samples for assay of vaccine IgG in serum for each vaccine administered; one sample will be drawn before administration of the vaccine and the second sample after administration of the vaccine. The first sample (pre -vaccination) may be drawn at any time up to 6 weeks prior to the scheduled vaccination . The second sample should preferably be draw n 3 to 4 weeks (maximum up to 6 weeks) after vaccination. Blood collections should be conducted at regularly scheduled study visits but if this is not feasible, the samples may also be collected at unscheduled visits. Details on the date(s) of vaccination and the specific vaccines administered (ie, brand and antigenic strains) should be collected on the Vaccination Record Form . The humoral response endpoints will be described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). Patients who do not get an adequate response to vaccine administration during part B of the study may be offered re -vaccination during the OLE . The clinical study s ites will be provided with post-vaccination titers only at the completion of the study due to risk of un blinding of this study. The determination of whether re -vaccination is needed will be made on a case -by case basis based on the titer results and the clinical relevance of these results.

Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study drug which may or may not have a causal relationship with the study drug. Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease which is temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. An AE also includes any worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or intensity) of a pre -existing condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug. 7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: • Results in death – includes all deaths, even those that appear to be completely unrelated to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger). • Is life-threateni ng – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of death at the time of the event. This does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. • Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . In-patient hospitalization is defined as a hospital admission (any duration) or an emergency room visit for longer than 24 hours. Prolongation of existing hospitalization is defined as a hospital stay that is longer than was originally anticipated for the event or is prolonged due to the development of a new AE as determined by the investigator or treating physician. • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions). • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect • Is an important medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent 1 of the other serious outcomes listed above (eg, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abu se). Criteria for reporting SAEs must be followed for these events. See Section 7.2 for more information on recording and reporting SAEs. VV-RIM-00131070-1.0 Approved - 28 Oct 2020 GMT-5:00"

Evaluation of Severity The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale: • Mild: Causes no or minimal interference with age appropriate daily activities. No intervention needed. • Moderate: Causes more than minimal interference with age appropriate daily activities. Local or non -invasive intervention indicated. • Severe: Causes inability to perform age appropriate daily activities. Hospitalization or invasive intervention indicated. If a laboratory value is considered an AE, its severity should be based on the degree of physiological impairment the value indicates. 7.3.2. Evaluation of Causality The relationship of AEs to study drug will be assessed by the investigator and will be a clinical decision based on all available information. The following question will be address ed: Is there a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been caused by the study drug? The possible answers are: Not Related: There is no reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drug Related: There is a reasona ble possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drug For a list of factors to consider in assessing the relationship of AEs to study drug, see Appendix 1.

STATISTICAL PLAN This section provides the basis for the SAP for the study. The SAP may be revised during the study to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make changes to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the planned analyses. The final SAP will be issued before the database is locked. Analysis variables are listed in Section 8. 9.1. Statistical Hypothesis Part A of the study is open -label ; therefore , no statistical hypotheses will be tested in this portion of the study. For part B of the study, the following null hypothesis and alternative will be tested for the dupilumab treatment group: H0: There is no treatment difference between dupilumab and placebo H1: There is a treatment difference between dupilumab and placebo Baseline weight group , baseline disease severity (IGA=3, 4), and region /country will be the 3 stratification factors for patient randomization that will be accounted for in the statistical modeling for efficacy.

Justification of Sample Size In part A of the study, the sample size of 40 patients was empirically based on the number of patients requir ed to adequately characterize the safety/PK profile in this population. For part B of the study, it is estimated that a sample size of 160 patients ( 80 patients per treatment group), at the 2 -sided 5% significance level, will provide the following: • 88% pow er to detect a difference of 21.4% between the dupilumab and placebo groups in the percentage of patients who achieve an IGA score of 0 to 1 at week 16, assuming that the percentages are 32.8% and 11.4% for the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively. • 99% power to detect a difference of 42.9% in the percentage of patients who achieve an EASI -75 response at week 16, assuming the percentages are 69.7% and 26.8% for the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively. The assumptions used for the above power cal culations were based on results from patients in the R668 -AD-1652 study (phase 3 combination study for patients ≥6 to <12 years of age with severe AD). As outline in Section 1.2.2 , the tiered fixed -dose regimen (200 mg Q4 W in patients ≥ 5- <15 kg, 300 mg Q 4W in patients ≥ 15-<30 kg) is expected to provided exposure comparable to that seen with 300 mg Q 4W in patients ≥6 to <12 years of age or 300 mg Q2W in adult patients. Further justification for the sample size comes from the results from the R668 -AD-1224 study (a phase 3 combi nation study for adult patients with moderate -to-severe AD ). In this study, the proportions of patients who achieved an IGA score of 0 to 1 at week 16 were 38.7% and 12.4% for dupilumab and placebo, respectively. The proportion s of patients who achieved an EASI -75 respon se at week 16 w ere 23.3% and 68.9% for dupilumab and placebo , respectively. The study will have a p ower of 96% on both the co -primary endpoints based on the results from the R668 -AD-1224 study. Additional support for the sample size comes from the R668 -AD-1526 study (a phase 3 study for adolescent patients with moderate -to-severe AD). The sample size calculations were done using nQuery (7.0). 9.3. Analysis Sets 9.3.1. Efficacy Analysis Sets The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized patients in part B; it is based on the treatment allocated (as randomized). The per protocol set (PPS) includes all patien ts in the FAS, except for those who are excluded because of major protocol violations. A major protocol violation is one that may affect the interpretation of study results and will be reviewed and adjudicated by study team. A final list of major protoco l violations will be generated prior to the primary database lock . All efficacy variables for part B will be evaluated using the FAS. The primary efficacy endpoint will also be evaluated using the PPS. The analysis using the FAS will be considered primar y. VV-RIM-00131070-1.0 Approved - 28 Oct 2020 GMT-5:00"

Safety Analysis Set For part A, the safety analysis set (SAF) includes all patients who received any study drug in part A; it is based on the treatment received (as treated). Both safety and efficacy variables for part A will be analyzed using the SAF. For part B, the SAF includes all randomized patients who received any study drug in part B. Treatment compliance/administration and all clinical safety variables in parts A and B will be analyzed using the SAF, as treated. 9.3.3. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Sets The PK analysis population includes all patients who receiv ed any study drug and who had at least 1 non -missing result following the first dose of study drug. The PK analysis set will be defined in parts A and B separately. 9.3.4. Immunogenicity Analysis Sets The ADA analysis set includes all patients who received study drug and had at least 1 non-missing ADA result following the first study dose. The neutralizing antibody ( NAb ) analysis set includes all patients who received any study drug and had at least 1 non -missing result in the NAb assay ( patients who are ADA negative will be set to negative in the NAb analysis set ).

Statistical Methods The analyses for parts A and B will be performed separately. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics will include the following: the number of patients reflected in the calculation (n), mean, standard deviation, median, first quartile (Q1), third quartile (Q3), minimum, and maximum. For categorical or ordinal data, frequencies and percentages will be displayed for each category. 9.5.1. Demography and Baseline Characteristics Demographic a nd baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by treatment group for parts A and B, respectively. 9.5.2. Efficacy Analyses For part A, the open -label portion of the study, descriptive statistics of the efficacy endpoints will be summarized. For part B, the efficacy analysis will be performed for the comparisons between the dupilumab treatment group and the placebo group. 9.5.2.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis The Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted by randomization strata (region /country, baseline disea se severity, and baseline weight group) will be used for the percentage of patients with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16, or percentage of patients with EASI -75 at week 16. To account for the impact of rescue treatment on the efficacy effect: For the primary efficac y endpoints (which are binary efficacy endpoints), if rescue treatment is used (see Section 5.3), the patient will be specified as a non -responder fr om the time the rescue is used. If a patient withdraws from study, this patient will be counted as a non -responder for endpoints after withdrawal. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to assess the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis with regards to the handling of missing data , such as using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach or worst observation carried forward (WOCF) approach to determine patient’s status at week 16 . Details will be specified in the SAP. In addition, the Coch ran-Mantel -Haenszel method adjusted by randomization strata will also be performed on all observed data regardless if rescue treatment is used. Patients with missing data will be counted as non -responders. 9.5.2.2. Secondary Efficacy Analysis For binary endpoints, the secondary efficacy analysis will use the same approach as that used for the primary efficacy analysis. For continuous endpoints, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used for the FAS with treatment group, randomization stratification facto rs (region/country, baseline disease severity, and baseline weight group) and relevant baseline measurement included in the model.

102,page_102,"Clinical Study Protocol R668 -AD-1539 Amendment 4 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Page 103 CONFIDENTIAL Similarly, to account for the impact of rescue treatment on the efficacy effect, patients' efficacy data through week 16 aft er the rescue treatment use will be set to missing. The missing data for continuous endpoints will be imputed by the pattern -mixture approach where the WOCF approach will be used for the missing due to rescue treatment, AE, and lack of efficacy and the mu ltiple imputation (MI) approach will be used for the missing due to other reasons. The MI Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) procedure with Markov Monte Carlo algorithm will be applied for multiple times. The complete datasets created based on the patte rn-mixture approach will be analyzed using the ANCOVA model defined previously, and the SAS MIANALYZE procedure will be used to generate valid statistical inferences by combining results from these multiple analyses using Rubin’s formula ( Rubin, 1987 ). All efficacy data will be used for analysis regardless of whether the patient is on study treatment or discontinues the study treatment but remains in the study. In addition, the MI with the ANCOVA model and the ANCOVA m odel based on LOCF or WOCF imputation method will be performed as the sensitivity analyses. Additional details on sensitivity analyses will be provided in the SAP. 9.5.2.3. Multiplicity Considerations No multiplicity adjustments will be made for part A. For part B , a hierarchical procedure will be used to control the overall Type -1 error rate at 0.05 for the primary endpoint (s) and the secondary endpoints for the dupilumab dose regimen v ersus placebo. The abbreviated, preliminary plan for hierarchical testing orde r for the primary endpoint and key secondary endpoints is shown in Table 3 .

Primary Analysis of the Study In order to expedite the submission to regulatory agencies, a primary analysis may be performed when the last patient completes 16 weeks of treatment in part B. No changes in the conduct of the study will be made based on this primary analysis. The assessment of primary and secondary endpoints specified in Section 8.2.1 and Section 8.2.2 performed during the an alysis will be the final analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints. Hence, there will be no need for alpha adjustment due to the primary analysis. If a decision is made to perform the primary analysis, in order to maintain study integrity with respect to the post -treatment follow -up visits, safety visits and analyses, a dissemination plan will be written. This plan will clearly identify the unblinded team (including the statistician) that will perform the primary analysis and all related activitie s, restrict other clinical team members and other sponsor personnel from access to individual patient treatment allocation and site level analysis results (ie, remain blinded) , and ensure that the dedicated unblinded team will not participate in the data r eview or data decisions for the subsequent post-treatment analyses. However, the dedicated unblinded team can participate in the analysis following the final database lock. 9.5.3. Safety Analysis The safety analysis will be based on the SAF. This includes reported TEAEs , AESIs, and other safety information (eg, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and 12 -lead ECG results). A summary of safety results for each treatment group will be presented. 9.5.3.1. Adverse Events Definitions For safety variables, 2 obs ervation periods are defined separately for parts A and B: • The pre -treatment period is defined as the time from signing the ICF to before the first dose of study drug. • The treatment -emergent period is defined as the day from the first dose of study drug to the end of the study. In Part B, the treatment -emergent period includes the 16-week treatment period and follow -up period. − Treatment period: date of the first dose of study drug to week 1 6 visit date (study day 113 starting from the first dose of study drug if week 16 visit date is unavailable) or early termination date, whichever comes first. − Follow -up period: date after week 16 visit date (study day 113 starting from first dose of study drug if week 16 visit date is unavailable) or early termination date, to end of study. Patients who continue into the OLE after the treatment period will not have a follow -up period. Treatment -emergent AEs are defined as those that are not present at bas eline or represent the exacerbation of a pre -existing condition during the overall study period.

Reasons may include the following, among others: • The investigator has received all items and information necessary to perform the study, but has not enrolled any patient within a reasonable period of time • The investigator has violated any fundamental obligation in the study agreement, including but not limited to, breach of this protocol (and any applicable amendments), breach of the applicable laws and regulations, or breach of any applicable ICH guidelines • The total number of patient s required for the study are enrolled earlier than expected In all cases, the appropriate IRB/EC and Hea lth Authorities must be informed according to applicable regulatory requirements, and adequate consideration must be given to the protection of the patient s’ interests. 16. STUDY DOCUMENTATION 16.1. Certification of Accuracy of Data A declaration assuring the accura cy and content of the data recorded on the CRFs must be signed by the investigator. This certification form accompanies each set of CRFs. The signed form will be provided to the sponsor with the final set of CRFs for each patient . 16.2. Retention of Records The investigator must retain all essential study documents, including ICFs, source documents, investigator copies of CRFs, and drug accountability records for at least 15 years following the completion or discontinuation of the study, or longer if a longer p eriod is required by relevant regulatory authorities. The investigator must consult with the sponsor before discarding or destroying any essential study documents following study completion or discontinuation. Records must be destroyed in a manner that e nsures confidentiality. If the investigator's personal situation is such that archiving can no longer be ensured, the investigator must inform the sponsor and the relevant records will be transferred to a mutually agreed -upon destination.

Sta rting on day -14, all patients will be required to initiate treatment with a low potency TCS using a standardized regimen. Based on investigator discretion, low/mild potency TCS may also be used on areas of thin skin (face, neck, intertriginous, and genit al areas, areas of skin atrophy, etc.). Hydrocortisone acetate 1% cream / hydrocortisone 1% cream should be used unless there are known side effects to these agents or due to non -availability due to any reason. In those cases, other low potency TCS such as desonide 0.05% cream or alclometasone dipropionate 0.05% cream can be used. The use of medium/high potency steroids should be reserved for rescue. It is recommended that triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% ointment be used for rescue. However, other medium or high potency TCS may be used as per investigator discretion. The use of very high potency steroids is not allowed during the study. VV-RIM-00131070-1.0 Approved - 28 Oct 2020 GMT-5:00"
