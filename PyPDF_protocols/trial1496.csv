The protocol history is provided below. Protocol History Version and Date of Protocol Comments Version 2.0, 13 April 2018 Version 3.0, 19 July 2018 Current version Key changes in the current version of the protocol are summarized below. Change and Rationale Affected Sections Removed G6PD deficiency and history of hemolysis as exclusion criteria. Table 3-1, Sections 8.2, 9.1.1.2, Updated language to reflect the current regulatory status of Symdeko. Sections 5.1 and 9.3.2 Updated study drug interruption and stopping rules; removal of exclusion due to G6PD deficiency makes separate interruption criterion based solely on serum bilirubin levels unnecessary. Section 9.8.1 Typographical and administrative changes were also made to improve the clarity of the document."

3,page_3,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 4 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Number of Subjects Approximately 360 subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the TC VX -445/TEZ/IVA arm or the triple placebo arm. Study Population Male and female subjects with CF who are 12 years of age or older and heterozygous for the F508del mutation and an MF mutation (F/MF subjects) Investigational Drug Study drug refers to VX -445/TEZ/ IVA, IVA, and their matching placebos. Active study drugs will be orally administered as 2 fixed -dose combination (FDC) film -coated tablets (VX -445/TEZ/ IVA) in the morning and as 1 film -coated IVA tablet in the evening. Active substance: VX-445, TEZ (tezacaftor; VX -661), and IVA (ivacaftor; VX-770) Activity: CFTR corrector, CFTR corrector, and CFTR potentiator (increased Cl− secretion) Strength: 100-mg VX-445/50-mg TEZ/75 -mg IVA FDC tablet Active substance: IVA (ivacaftor; VX -770) Activity: CFTR potentiator (increased Cl− secretion) Strength: 150-mg tablet Study Duration The total study duration is approximately 32 weeks (4 weeks for the Screening Period, 24 weeks for the Treatment Period, and 4 weeks for the Safety Follow -up Period). Study Design This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter study. Approximately 360 subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the TC arm or triple placebo arm. The dosages to be evaluated are shown in the table below. Randomization wil l be stratified by ppFEV1 determined during the Screening Period (<70 versus ≥70), age at the Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years of age), and sex (male versus female)."

The primary null hypothesis to be tested is that the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline is the same for the 2 treatment groups, VX -445/TEZ/IVA and placebo. The null hypothesis will be tested at an overall 2 -sided significance level of 0.05. An interim analysis (IA) is planned when at least 140 subjects complete the Week 4 Visit and at least 100 subjects complete the Week 12 Visit. The IA will be performed by an external independent biostatistician who is not involved in and will not influence the conduct of the study, and the results will be reviewed by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC). A Lan and DeMets alpha spending fu nction will be applied to control the overall type I error rate of 0.05 for the primary endpoints during the IA and the final analysis such that an alpha of 0.01 will be preserved for the final analysis. If the number of subjects included in the IA is 140, then the primary endpoint of the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Week 4 will be tested at a significance level of 0.044 during the IA. The actual alpha at the IA ( α0) will be determined based on the actual number of subjects included in the IA. Assuming a within- group SD of 7 percentage points and a 5% dropout rate at Week 4, an IA sample size of 70 subjects in each treatment group will have approximately 98% power to detect a difference between the treatment groups of 5.0 percentage points for the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4, based on a 2- sided, 2-sample t-test at a significance level of 0.044. If the P value for the primary endpoint at the IA is less than α0, then the efficacy boundary has been crossed. If the IDMC declares that the study has crossed the efficacy boundary, then the study may be unblinded to a limited Vertex team to prepare regulatory submission(s). Members of the limited Vertex unblinded team will not be involved in or influence the conduct of the remaining part of the study to protect the integrity of the study. If the P value fails to cross the efficacy boundary during the IA, then the primary endpoint of absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4 will be tested after all subjects complete study participation at an alpha of 0.01. Assuming a within -group SD of 7 percentage points and a 5% dropout rate at Week 4 and 10% dropout rate at Week 24, a final analysis sample size of 180 subjects in each treatment group will have approximately 99% power to detect a difference between the treatment groups of 5.0 percentage points for the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4, based on a 2- sided, 2-sample t-test at a significance level of 0.01. The analysis of the primary endpoint during the IA will be based on a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Day 15 and Week 4 as the dependent variable. During the final analysis, the same model will be implemented, including all availab le data. The model will include treatment group, visit, and"
5,page_5,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 6 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects; with sex (male versus female), continuous baseline ppFEV 1, and age at screening (<18 versus ≥18 years of age) as covariates; and with an unstructured covariance structure for the within -subject errors. The primary result obtained from the model will be the estimated treatment difference at Week 4. The adjusted mean difference at Week 4 with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals and 2-sided P values will be provided. Furthermore, the adjusted mean and treatment difference at each post -baseline visit, obtained from the model at the final analysis, will also be provided. The key secondary endpoints will be formally tested only during the final analysis when all subjects complete study participation, at the significance level of 0.05, if the primary endpoint is statistically significant at either the IA or at the final analysis. The safety endpoints include AEs, clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry through the Safety Follow -up Visit. The safety analysis will be descriptive only. IDMC Reviews An IDMC will conduct periodic planned safety review(s) of study data and the planned efficacy IA, as outlined in the IDMC charter."

At present, there is no cure. CF affects approximately 70,000 individuals worldwide1 (approximately 30,000 in the US1,2 and 39,000 in the EU3). Based on its prevalence, CF qualifies as an orphan disease .4, 5 CF is caused by decreased quantity and/or function of the CFTR protein due to mutations in the CFTR gene. The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel that aids in regulating salt and water absorption and secretion and pH balance in sweat glands and multiple organs, including the lungs, pancreas, and other gastrointestinal organs. Despite progress in the treatment of CF with antibiotics and mucolytics, the predicted median age of survival for a person with CF is approximately 40 years. 2,6 Progressive loss of lung function is the leading cause of mortality .7 More effective treatments are needed for CF. The most common disease- causing CFTR mutation, F508del , accounts for 70% of the identified alleles in people with CF8, and approximately 40% of people with CF are homozygous for F508del (F/F) .2, 3, 8 Based on the understanding of the molecular defects caused by CFTR mutations, 2 complementary approaches have been developed to address the decreased quantity and/or function of CFTR in order to enhance chloride transport in patients with CF. Correctors facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking to increase the q uantity of functional CFTR at the cell surface. Potentiators increase the channel open probability of the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface to enhance ion transport. Depending on the amount of residual CFTR channel activity in the membrane, and the pathophysiology of that activity (reflecting the CFTR genotype of the patient and possibly other factors), both approaches may be required. The therapeutic activity of CFTR correctors and potentiators has been established with products that were developed by Vertex and approved for the treatment of CF: ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy (Kalydeco ®), and lumacaftor (LUM) in combination with IVA (Orkambi®). Kalydeco and Orkambi are approved to treat CF in patients with specific CFTR genotypes. A second corrector/p otentiator combination, tezacaftor (TEZ)/IVA (Symdeko®) is approved in certain countries. VX-445 is a next-generation CFTR corrector being developed for administration in triple combination (TC) with TEZ/IVA for the treatment of CF. 5.2 Rationale for the Pre sent Study This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of VX -445 in TC with TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF who are heterozygous for F508del (F) and a second CFTR allele carrying a minimal function (MF) mutation that is non -responsive to TEZ, IVA, or TEZ/ IVA (refer to Appendix A for MF mutations). Patients with this genotype (F/MF) usually have severe disease and lack approved CFTR modulator therapy; previous studies with TEZ /IVA (Study VX14-661-107) and LUM/IVA (Study VX09-809-102) failed to demonstrate efficacy in this patient population. Due to this high unmet need, VX-445 is being developed in TC with TEZ/IVA for F/MF subjects. The potential for benefit in these patients is supported by in vitro data and clinical data in F/MF"

24,page_24,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 25 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 9.1.1 Screening The Screening Period (Day -28 through Day -1) will occur within 28 days before the first dose of study drug. Screening assessments will be used to confirm that subjects meet the eligibility criteria. The investigator (or an appropriate authorized designee) will obtain informed consent and assent, if applicable, from each subject before any study procedure takes place. 9.1.1.1 Repetition of Screening Assessment(s) Screening assessments may be repeated once to establish study eligibility. If repeat values of the individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and completed within the screening window, then the subject is eligible for the study. 9.1.1.2 Rescreening Subjects may be rescreened once. If a subject is rescreened, all screening assessments will be repeated, except for: • CFTR genotyping • Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level (if serum FSH level was in the postmenopausal range as determined by the laboratory performing the test during prior screening) • G6PD activity test • Ophthalmologic examination (if performed within 3 months of the date of informed consent, for subjects <18 years of age ) If a subject is rescreened, a new screening window will begin when the first rescreening assessment has been initiated. 9.1.1.3 Extension of Screening Period Window A subject may have the Screening Period window extended by 2 weeks for the following reasons: • Repetition of the Screening Period assessments (Section 9.1.1.1) • Unexpected operational or logistic delays, or to meet the eligibility criteria • Scheduling of ophthalmologic examination (for subjects <18 years of age on the date of informed consent, Section 11.7.6) • 28-day washout period for subjects who have been on an investigational or commercially available CFTR modulator (e.g., TEZ/IVA, IVA [Kalydeco], LUM/IVA [Orkambi]; see Table 9-2). 9.1.2 Treatment Period The Treatment Period will be randomized, double-blind, and placebo- controlled. It will last approximately 24 weeks (Day 1 through Week 24). Study drug administration details are provided in Section 9.6."
25,page_25,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 26 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Randomization will occur before the first dose of study drug during the Treatment Period and may occur on either Day 1 or Day -1. Randomization and stratification details are provided in Section 9.2. Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment will remain in the study from the time of discontinuation of study drug treatment through the last scheduled study visit and complete the assessments for all study visits, as described in Section 9.1.3. 9.1.3 Follow-up The Safety Follow-up Visit will occur approximately 28 days after the last dose of study drug for subjects who complete study drug dosing and for subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing, as described in Section 9.1.4. An open-label study will be available for subjects who complete the Week 24 Visit and are eligible. The Safety Follow -up Visit is not required for subjects who complete the Week 24 Visit and enroll in an open- label study within 28 days after the last dose of study drug. 9.1.4 Early Termination of Treatment If a subject prematurely discontinues study drug treatment, an Early Termination of Treatment (ETT) Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible aft er the decision to discontinue treatment. Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment will also be required to complete the Safety Follow-up Visit, approximately 28 days after their last dose of study drug. The assessments performed at the Safety Follow -up Visit are listed in Table 3-2. If the ETT Visit occurs 3 weeks or later following the last dose of study drug, then the ETT Visit will replace the Safety Follow -up Visit, and a separate Safety Follow -up Visit will not be required. Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment will continue to complete all scheduled study visits for assessments following completion of the ETT Visit, as detailed in Table 3-2. Data regarding concomitant antibiotic therapy for sinopulmonary signs/symptoms will also continue to be collected for these subjects. If a subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent or assent, no further assessments will be performed. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data and samples collected before such withdrawal of consent or ass ent. 9.1.5 Lost to Follow -up A subject will be considered lost to follow-up if both of the following occur: • The subject misses 2 consecutive study visits (telephone contact and/or clinic visit) and is subsequently unable to be contacted by telephone (3 documente d attempts by telephone within 2 weeks following the second missed visit) • The subject does not respond within 2 weeks to a registered letter sent after the 3 attempted telephone contacts. 9.1.6 Completion of Study Participation Completion of study participation for each individual subject is defined as one of the following:"
26,page_26,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 27 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated • For subjects who complete the Treatment Period and enter an open- label study within 28 days of the Week 24 Visit: the Week 24 Visit • For subjects who complete the Treatment Period and do not enter an open- label study within 28 days of the Week 24 Visit: the Safety Follow -up Visit • For subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment but do not withdraw consent (and assent, as applicable): the latest of the Week 24 Visit, ETT Visit, or S afety Follow -up Visit (if required) • For subjects who withdraw consent or assent: date of withdrawal of consent or assent, whichever is earlier ( Section 9.9) If subjects are lost to follow -up (Section 9.1.5) , the date of completion of study participation will be defined as the date of the last contact. The end of study is defined in Section 13.2.8. 9.1.7 Independent Data Monitoring Committee This study will be monitored by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), which will conduct periodic planned safety review(s) of study data and the planned efficacy interim analysis (IA) (Section 12.3.6.2) . Procedural details of the IDMC structure and function, frequency of meetings, and data planned for review will be included in the IDMC charter. The IDMC charter will be finalized before the first subject is screened. 9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the TC VX-445/TEZ/IVA arm or to the triple placebo arm. Randomization will be stratified by ppFEV 1 determined during the Screening Period (<70 versus ≥70), age at the Screening Visit (<18 versus ≥18 years of age), and sex (male versus female). An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment. The randomization code list will be produced by Vertex Biometrics or a qualified randomization vendor. 9.3 Rationale for Study Design and Study Drug Regimens 9.3.1 Study Design This Phase 3 study will assess the efficacy, safety, PD, and PK of VX-445/TEZ/IVA TC therapy in subjects with CF who have F/MF genotypes. A randomized, double-blind, controlled study design was selected to ascertain the effects of VX-445/TEZ/IVA while avoiding observer bias. Placebo is considered the appropriate comparator because efficacy has not been established for a corrector, potentiator, or any corrector/potentiator combination in subjects with F/MF genotypes . This study will have a 24-week treatment duration to allow for the collection of placebo-controlled safety data for this duration and the collection of data for outcomes that require longer tre atment durations to demonstrate an effect (e.g., PEx and changes in nutritional status). The primary endpoint is the absolute change in ppFEV 1 at Week 4. Previous studies of CFTR modulators (IVA, LUM/IVA, and TEZ/IVA) have demonstrated that efficacy related to lung"
27,page_27,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 28 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated function (ppFEV 1) can be reliably established using an endpoint at Week 4. In these studies, rapid improvements in ppFEV 1 are observed by Day 15, with a separation between the active treatment and placebo groups that is sustained through 24 weeks of treatment. These studies were conducted in patients with different genotypes, baseline ppFEV 1, and age groups, using CFTR modulators that had different magnitudes of response. 9.3.2 Study Drug Dose VX-445 Dosage A VX-445 dose of 200 mg qd was selected for the current study based on an assessment of the benefit-risk profile from the Phase 2 Study VX16-445-001 (Study 445-001) Part D, which evaluated a range of VX -445 doses (50 mg qd, 100 mg qd, and 200 mg qd) in TC with TEZ/IVA for 4 weeks in subjects with F/ MF genotypes. The TC was generally safe and well tolerated in all VX-445 dose groups, and F/MF subjects who received the VX-445 200 mg qd TC demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in ppFEV 1 (within-group mean [SE] absolute change of 13.8 [1.4] percentage points from baseline [ P<0.0001], compared with a mean absolute change of 0.0 [2.0] percentage points in subjects who received placebo [ P = 0.9943]). The dose-response relationship of VX-445 in TC was assessed for ppFEV 1 and SwCl for F/MF patients using population-PK/PD modeling. Results indicate that a dose of 200 mg qd provides meaningful improvement for ppFEV 1 and SwCl, while a dose less than 200 mg qd may result in some subjects having suboptimal improvement in CFTR function. No differences in the safety profile of VX -445/TEZ/IVA were observed across the doses. TEZ and IVA Dosages TEZ will be administered as 100 mg qd and IVA will be administered as 150 mg q12h. This is the approved dosing regimen for Symdeko, which is approved in certain countries . Dosage for Subjects Aged 12 to 17 Years Phase 3 studies with IVA and TEZ/IVA have demonstrated similar exposures between adults (≥18 years old) and adolescent subjects ≥12 to <18 years of age. Significant differences in VX-445, TEZ, and IVA exposures are not expected between adolescent subjects and adults in the present study; therefore, all subjects will receive the same dose of VX -445/TEZ/IVA. 9.3.3 Rationale for Study Population This study will enroll subjects with CF with F/MF genotypes. As described in Section 5.2, patients with F/MF genotypes have unmet need and are expected to respond to a TC regimen of VX-445/TEZ/IVA based on results from a Phase 2 study conducted in F/MF subjects, in vitro experiments in relevant human F/MF cell -based model systems, and results from ongoing Phase 2 studies with VX -445/TEZ/IVA. Given the progressive nature of CF, there is a strong rati onale for treating patients earlier in life. Experience with CFTR modulators in adolescent subjects ≥12 to <18 years of age, including with TEZ/IVA, suggests that the exposures and safety profile of VX-445/TEZ/IVA will be similar in adolescents and adults, which supports evaluation of VX-445/TEZ/IVA in adolescents in the present study."

For subjects who are screened but are not subsequently randomized, details of prior medication will be documented only in the subjects’ source documents. • Subjects should remain on a stable treatment regimen for their CF from 28 days before the Day 1 Visit through completion of study participation . Stable treatment regimen is defined as the current treatment regimen for CF that subjects have been following for at least 28 days before the Day 1 Visit. Subjects should not initiate long- term treatment with new medication from 28 days before the Day 1 Visit through completion of study participation . Guidelines for stable treatment regimens for CF are as follows: o Subjects who are taking inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics should remain on that regimen throughout the study. o Subjects who cycle onto and off of an inhaled antibiotic should continue on their prior schedule. The timing of the first dose of study drug on the Day 1 Visit should be synchronized as closely as possible (e.g., not more than ± 3 days) to the first day in the cycle onto the inhaled antibiotic."
30,page_30,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 31 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated o Subjects who alternate between 2 different inhaled antibiotics should remain on the same cycling schedule during the study. The timing of the first dose of study drug on the Day 1 Visit should be synchronized as closely as possible (e.g., not more than ± 3 days) to the first day in the cycle onto 1 of the inhaled antibiotics. • Subjects may receive doses of prednisone or prednisolone of up to 10 mg/day chronically, or up to 60 mg daily for up to 5 days. • Information about bronchodilator use during the study will be collected and documented.

All subjects will receive the same number of tablets each day to maintain the blind. Additional information is provided in the Pharm acy Manual. Study drug will be administered with a fat -containing meal or snack, such as a standard “ CF” meal or snack or a standard meal. 1. It is recommended that the dose be taken within 30 minutes of the start of the meal or snack. 2. Study drug will be administered as 2 fixed -dose combination (FDC) TC or placebo tablets in the morning and as 1 IVA or placebo tablet in the evening. For each subject, doses of study drugs will be taken at approximately the same time (± 2 hours) each day. 3. The date, amount taken, and time of study drug administration, including whether food was taken with each dose, will be recorded for the 2 doses before PK sample collection and the dose received on the morning of PK sample collection. 4. On days of scheduled visits, the morning dose of study drug (TC or placebo) will be administered at the site after predose assessments have been completed. A meal or snack will be provided by the site for the morning dose of TC or placebo. 5. If a subject ’s scheduled visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines must be used: • If the dose in the clinic will be within 6 hours of the subject’s scheduled morning dose, the subject should withhold their morning dose of TC or placebo and the morning dose will be administered in the clinic. • If the dose in the clinic will be more than 6 hours after the subject’s scheduled morning dose, the subject should take the morning dose of TC or placebo at home. • At the Day 1, Day 15, and Week 4 Visits, the morning dose of TC or placebo must be administered in the clinic to enable post- dose ECG assessments or PK sampling (as applicable) relative to the morning dose. 6. Subjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused materials associated with the study drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at e ach visit, as appropriate."

If more than 6 hours but fewer than 12 hours have elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the subject should take the morning dose of TC or placebo but skip the evening dose of study drug (IVA or placebo). If more than 12 hours have elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the subject should skip the morning dose of TC or placebo and take the evening dose of IVA or placebo. 9.6.2.2 Evening Dose of Study Drug If a subject misses the evening dose of IVA or placebo and recalls within 6 hours, the subject should take his/her dose with food. If more than 6 hours have elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the subject should skip that dose and resume his/her normal schedule for the following dose. 9.7 Dose Modification for Toxicity No dose modifications for toxicity are allowed. Treatment may be interrupted as outlin ed in Section 9.8. If any unacceptable toxicity arises, individual subjects will discontinue dosing (Section 9.1.4). 9.8 Study Drug Interruption and Stopping Rules The medical monitor should be notified of an interruption of study drug that lasts >72 hours for any reason and of the resumption of study drug after such interruption. 9.8.1 Liver Function Tests The central laboratory will notify the medical monitor of ALT or AST >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN that are derived from centrally submitted samples. Subjects with new treatment -emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3 × ULN, with or without total bilirubin >2 × ULN, must be followed closely, including confirmatory testing performed by the central laboratory within 48 to 72 hours of the initial finding and subsequent close monitoring of ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels, as clinically indicated. If a subject cannot return to the site for confirmatory testing, a local laboratory may be used. Local laboratory results must be reported immediately to the medical monitor , and the subject must have the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 72 hours). Study drug administration must be interrupted immediately (prior to confirmatory testing) if any of the following criteria are met: • ALT or AST >8 × ULN • ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks • ALT or AST >3 × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be followed closely for clinical progression."
32,page_32,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 33 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Study drug administration must be discontinued if the following criterion is met: • Subsequent ALT or AST values confirm the initial elevation that satisfied the interruption rule (above), and no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, alcohol ingestion) is identified, regardless of whether transaminase levels have improved All subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases (and bilirubin, as applicable) should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline. If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation with or without increased bilirubin or clinical jaundice has been identified, study drug administration may be resumed once transaminases return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, whichever is higher. Regardless of the duration of interruption, the medical monitor should be notified prior to resumption of study drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases and bilirubin should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a pr otocol-defined transaminase elevation interruption threshold recurs within 4 weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by repeat testing within 48 to 72 hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless of the presumed etiology. 9.8.2 Rash Individuals who develop a generalized rash will be monitored closely. Study drug dosing should be interrupted if a subject develops a generalized rash of Grade 3 or higher, or a rash that is considered a serious adverse event. The investigator will notify the medical monitor of any rash that results in interruption of study drug, is Grade 3 or higher ( Section 13.1.1.4) , or is a serious adverse event ( SAE). Investigators should consider additional evaluation including laboratory testing (e.g., complete blood count [CBC] with differential, LFTs), photographs of the rash, and dermatology consultation. The investigator may consider resumption of study drug if considered clinically appropriate. 9.9 Removal of Subjects Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request. Subjects may be withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Vertex for safety, behavior, noncompliance with study procedures, or administrative reasons. If a subject has been withdrawn from study drug treatment, the subject will continue to be followed, provided that the subject has not withdrawn consent (and assent, as applicable). In addition, a subject must be discontinued from study drug treatment if the subject meets any of the following criteria: • Has a screening CFTR genotype that does not confirm study eligibility if a previous CFTR genotype laboratory report was used to establ ish eligibility. These subjects must be discontinued from the study ( Section 8.1) • Meets any of the stopping (discontinuation) criteria ( Section 9.8) • Becomes pregnant ( Section 11.7.7.2) Subjects who discontinue study drug treatment should return for study assessments, as noted in Section 9.1.3."

Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused materials associated with the study drug to the site. These materials will be retained at the site according to instructions provided by Vertex or its de signee. The study monitor will review study drug records and inventory throughout the study. If a site uses a site -specific drug accountability system and/or process, including processes associated with the destruction of returned materials, the process must be documented and approved by Vertex. The study monitor must review the drug accountability documentation on a regular basis. The study monitor will promptly communicate to Vertex any discrepancies he/she is unable to resolve with the site. 10.5 Disposal, R eturn, or Retention of Unused Drug The study site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials returned by the subjects until the study monitor has performed drug accountability. The investigator will ensure that the materials are destroyed in com pliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Vertex. Destruction will be adequately documented. 10.6 Compliance To ensure treatment compliance, the investigator or designee will supervise all study drug dosing that occurs at the site. At each visit, site personnel will review that the subject is compliant with study drug dosing and remind the subject of study drug dosing requirements. Compliance will also be assessed by ongoing study drug count. If a subject demonstrates continued noncompliance of study drug dosing despite educational efforts, the investigator should consider discontinuing the subject from the study. 10.7 Blinding and Unblinding This will be a double-blind study."
35,page_35,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 36 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 10.7.1 Blinding All subjects (and their parents/caregivers/companions), site personnel (including the investigator, the site monitor, and the study team), and members of the Vertex study team will be blinded to the treatment codes. Individuals who may be unblinded include only the following: • Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject in the event of a life- threatening medical emergency • Any site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject and her fetus in the event of a pregnancy • Vertex Global Patient Safety (GPS) and Regulatory Affairs personnel to satisfy serious adverse event (SAE) processing and reporting regulations • Vendor preparing the final (production) randomization list • Vertex IWRS Manager • Vertex Clinical Supply Chain • IDMC • External independent biostatistician preparing the unblinded analysis for review by the IDMC • Bioanalytical contract research organization (CRO) analyzing PK samples and the Vertex Bioanalytical personnel who is not a member of the study team but reviews raw data from the Bioanalytical CRO. The Vertex Bioanalytical study team member will continue to be blinded. • Vendor for modeling and simulations performing population PK modeling in preparation for regulatory submission(s) For the purpose of regulatory submissions, a limited Vertex team may be unblinded to the IA if the IDMC declares that the study has crossed the efficacy boundary ( Section 12.3.6.1) . Members of the limited Vertex unblinded team will not be involved in or influence the conduct of the remaining part of the study to protect the integrity of the study. Access to Spirometry and SwCl Results : During the conduct of the study, the Vertex study team will not have access to the spirometry or SwCl results after the morning dose on Day 1. Shortly before any planned efficacy analysis is conducted, the spirometry and SwCl data will be reviewed for dat a cleaning purposes by a biostatistician who does not have access to the treatment codes. Individual SwCl test results will not be disclosed to the study sites with the exception of the screening values. Subjects and their parents/caregivers/companions should not be informed of study-related spirometry results until Vertex has determined that the study has completed (i.e., clinical study report [CSR] finalization), regardless of whether the subject has prematurely discontinued treatment."
36,page_36,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 37 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 10.7.2 Unblinding At the initiation of the study, the study site will be instructed on the method for breaking the blind. The unblinding method will be either a manual or electronic process. Unblinding of Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Investigator for Medical Emergencies or Urgent Clinical Situations Unblinding of the individual subject’ s treatment by the investigator will be limited to medical emergencies or urgent clinical situations in which knowledge of the subject’ s study treatment is necessary for clinical management. In such cases, investigators will use their best judgment as to whether to unblind without first attempting to contact the medical monitor to discuss and agree to the need for unblinding. If investigators deem it not necessary to unblind immediately, they will first attempt to contact the medical monitor to discuss and agree to the need for unblinding. If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the medical monitor, they will use their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding without having successfully reached and discussed the situation with the medical monitor. In case of emergency, the investigator will have the final decision and unilateral right for unblinding. Contact information for the medical monitor (or appropriate backup) will be provided in a separate document. In addition, the Vertex Medical Information Call Center ( ) will answer calls 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days of the year, and will triage these calls to the study medical monitor or appropriate backup. If a subject ’s treatment assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent clinical situation, the medical monitor will be notified within 24 hours of the unblinding event. The reason and the date of the unblinding will be documented clearly in the subject’ s study file. Information about the treatment assignment obtained from the unblinding will be maintained in a secure location with controlled access and will not be shared with the sponsor (Vertex), CRO, or any site personnel (other than the physician treating the subject). In addition, the investigator will consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding will be considered an SAE, according to the regulatory defini tions or criteria for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report to Vertex GPS or designee, per Section 13.1.2. Unblinding of Individual Subject Treatme nt Assignments by Vertex GPS or Designee for SAEs or Safety Concerns Vertex GPS or designee will also unblind any SAE reports in compliance with regulatory reporting requirements. In addition, Vertex may, for matters relating to safety concerns, unblind individual subjects at any time. Unblinding: Interim Analysis The IA will be performed by an external independent biostatistician who is not involved in and will not influence study conduct. The analyses generated by the external independent biostatistician will then be reviewed by the IDMC. If the IDMC declares that the study has crossed the prespecified efficacy boundary ( Section 12.3.6.1) , then the study may be unblinded by a limited Vertex team to prepare a regulatory submission(s).

During the Screening Period, spirometry assessments may be performed pre- or post-bronchodilator. At all other visits, all spirometry assessments should be performed pre-bronchodilator. During the Treatment Period, spirometry assessments must be performed before study drug dosing ( Section 9.6.1) at approximately the same time at each visit. In the event that a subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator(s), spirometry should be performed according to the following: • If a subject ’s Day 1 spirometry assessment is pre -bronchodilator, but, on a subsequent visit, the subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator use, a post-bronchodilator spirometry assessment will be obtained for that visit only, and the visit will not be rescheduled. • If, on Day 1, the subject forgets to withhold his/her dose of bronchodilator, spirometry should be performed post-bronchodilator, and all subsequent spirometric measurements (according to the schedule of assessments in Table 3-2) should be performed post-bronchodilator. • Each spirometry assessment will be recorded in the source documents as pre- or post-bronchodilator. All sites will be provided with spirometers to be used for all study assessments. Spirometry data will be transmitted to a centralized spirometry service for quality review. The investigator ’s assessment of the spirometry results will be used for the screening assessment and determination of eligibility.

The use of a local laboratory that routinely runs the assay is permissible following approval by the medical monitor. Additional Evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be perf ormed at other times if judged to be clinically appropriate. For the purposes of study conduct and unless noted otherwise (e.g., G6PD activity test), only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator becom es aware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the investigator may base the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value. 11.7.3 Physical Examination s and Vital Signs A PE of all body systems and vital signs assessment will be performed at screening and select study visits (see Table 3-1 and Table 3-2 ). At other visits, symptom-directed PEs and symptom- directed vital sign assessments will occur at any time if deemed necessary by the investigator or healthcare provider. A complete PE includes a review of the following systems: head, neck, and thyroid; eyes, ears, nose, and throat (EENT); respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorec tal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indicated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in PEs will be reported as AEs. Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature (oral), pulse r ate, and respiration rate. These will be assessed before dosing and following at least a 5- minute rest. 11.7.4 Pulse Oximetry Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive measure of oxygen delivery to the tissues and has been correlated with clinical status and lung function. Arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry will be assessed following at least a 5 -minute rest and before study drug dosing.

If the QTcF is increased by >60 msec from the baseline or an absolute QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs will be performed approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the QTcF values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>60 msec from baseline or ≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2 successive ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement. Further details pertaining to ECGs will be provided to sites in the ECG Manual. 11.7.6 Ophthalmologic Examination Ophthalmologic examinations will be conducted only for subjects who are <18 years of age on the date of informed consent. The examination does not need to be completed if there is documentation of bilateral lens removal for the subject. All examinations will be conducted by a licensed ophthalmologist or optometrist and will include: • measurement of the best -corrected distance visual acuity of each eye; and • pharmacologically dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp The screening examination does not need to be conducted if there is documentation of an examination meeting the protocol requirements that was conducted within 3 months before the date of informed consent. In addition to the screening ophthalmologic examination, subjects who are <18 years of age on the date of informed consent and who have completed at least 12 week s of study drug treatment will have a single ophthalmologic examination at completion of study participation (defined in Section 9.1.6), except for those subjects who have withdrawn consent or assent. This examination should be completed within 4 weeks before the Week 24 Visit, unless the subject prematurely discontinues study drug, in which case this examination should occur by the Safety Follow-up V isit (or ETT Visit for subjects who do not complete a Safety Follow-up Visit), as described in Table 3-2.

If a female subject becomes pregnant during study participation, study drug will be permanently discontinued immediately. The investigator will notify the medical monitor and Vertex GPS within 24 hours of the site’ s knowledge of the subject ’s (or partner ’s) pregnancy using the Pregnancy Information Collection Form. Male subjects with female partners who become pregnant during the study must use a male condom to avoid exposure of a potential embryo or fetus to study drug via the seminal fluid. If confirmed to be on active drug, the subject or partner will be followed until the end of the pregnancy and the infant will be followed for 1 year after the b irth, provided informed consent is obtained. A separate ICF will be provided to explain these follow- up activities. Pregnancy itself does not constitute an AE. 12 STATISTICAL AND ANAL YTICAL PLANS This section presents a summary of the planned analyses for thi s protocol. Statistical analysis details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), and clinical pharmacologic analysis details will be provided in the clinical pharmacology analysis plan (CPAP), both of which will be finalized before the cli nical data lock for the study and treatment unblinding. 12.1 Sample Size and Power Approximately 360 subjects will be enrolled and randomized (1:1) to the TC VX-445/TEZ/IVA arm or the triple placebo arm. This sample size was determined to provide adequate power for the key secondary endpoint of number of PEx through Week 24. Information regarding the powering of primary and key secondary endpoints is provided below. Power for Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4. The primary null hypothesis to be tested is that the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline is the same for the 2 treatment groups, VX-445/TEZ/IVA and placebo. If the number of subjects included in the IA is 140, the null hypothesis will be tested at a 2 -sided significance level of 0.044 during the IA and at an overall 2-sided significance level of 0.05. Assuming a within -group SD of 7 percentage points and a 5% dropout rate at Week 4, an IA sample size of 70 subjects in each treatment group will have approximately 98% power to detect a difference between the treatment groups of 5.0 percentage points for the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4, based on a 2-sided, 2- sample t-test at a significance level of"
48,page_48,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 49 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 0.044. If the P value fails to cross the efficacy boundary during the IA ( P value ≥0.044; assuming 140 subjects included in the IA), the primary endpoint of absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4 will be tested after all subjects complete study participation at an alpha of 0.01. A final analysis sample size of 180 subjects in each treatment group will have approximately 99% power to detect a difference between the treatment groups of 5.0 percentage points for the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4, based on a 2-sided, 2-sample t-test at a significance level of 0.01. All power calculations were based on EAST software Version 6.4. Power for Selected Key Secondary Endpoints A key secondary endpoint is the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through Week 24. Assuming a within -group SD of 7 percentage points and a 10% dropout rate at Week 24, a sample size of 180 subjects in each treatment group will have approximately 99% power to detect a difference between the treatment groups of 5.0 percentage points for the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through Week 24, based on a 2-sided, 2- sample t-test at a significance level of 0.05. Another key secondary endpoint is the number of PEx through Week 24. Assuming a rate of PEx for the placebo group of 0.6 over 24 weeks and a 10% dropout rate, with 180 subjects and the overdispersion parameter of 0.5 in each treatment group, the power to detect a 40% reduction in the PEx rate for TC group compared to placebo group is approximately 80%, based on a 2-sided, 2-sample negative binomial regression model test for the ratio of rates, at a significance level of 0.05. 12.2 Analysis Sets The following analysis sets are defined: All Subjects Set, Full Analysis Set (FAS), and Safety Set. The All Subjects Set will include all subjects who were randomized or received at least 1 dose of study drug. This analysis set will be used for all individual subject data listings and disposition summary tables, unless otherwise specified. The FAS will include all randomized subjects who carry the intended CFTR allele mutation and receive at least 1 dose of study drug. The FAS will be used to summarize subject demographics and baseline characteristics, and for all efficacy analyses in which subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment group, unless otherwise specified. The Safety Set will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The Safety Set will be used for all safety analyses in which subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they received, unless otherwise specified . Additional analysis sets related to the interim analysis will be described in the SAP. 12.3 Statistical Analysis 12.3.1 General Considerations Continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max). The precision of the measurement for each continuous variable will be specified in the SAP. Unless otherwise specified, min and max values will be reported with the same precision as"
49,page_49,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 50 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated the units of the raw data. The mean, median, and SD will be reported to 1 additional decimal place. Any values that require a transformation to standard units (metric or SI) will be converted with the appropriate precision. Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. Percentages will be presented to 1 decimal place. The baseline value , unless otherwise specified, will be defined as the most recent non -missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug. For ECG, baseline will be defined as the most recent pretreatment measurement (or the average of triplicate measurements, if the most recent pretreatment measurement is obtained in triplicate) before the first dose of study drug. Absolute change from baseline will be calculated as post -baseline value – baseline value. The Treatment -emergent (TE) Period will include the time from the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period (TC or Placebo) to 28 days after the last dose of the study drug or to the completion of study participation date (as defined in Section 9.1.6) , whichever occurs first. 12.3.2 Background Characteristics 12.3.2.1 Subject Disposition The number and percentage of subjects in each disposition category (e.g., randomized, included in the FAS, included in the Safety Set, completed Treatment Period, completed study, prematurely discontinued treatment or study with a breakdown of the reasons for discontinuation, and entered an open- label study) will be summarized overall and by treatment group. 12.3.2.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Demographic, medical history, and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive summary statistics. The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized overall and by treatment group for the FAS and will include (but are not limited to): sex, race, baseline age, baseline weight, baseline height, baseline BMI, baseline ppFEV 1, and baseline SwCl. Medical history will be summarized by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) for the FAS. No statistical tests will be performed to evaluate baseline imbalance between treatment groups. 12.3.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Medications Medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug-Dictionary and categorized as follo ws: • Prior medication: any medication that was administered during the 56 days before initial dosing of study drug • Concomitant medication: medication continued or newly received during the TE Period • Post-treatment medication: medication continued or newly r eceived after the TE Period"
50,page_50,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 51 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated A given medication may be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or a post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post- treatment; or prior, concomitant, and post- treatment. If a medication has a missing or partially missing start/end date or time and if it cannot be determined whether it was taken before the first dose of study drug, concomitantly during the TE Period, or after the TE Period, it will be considered in all 3 categories of prior, concomitant, and post- treatment medication. Prior medications and concomitant medications will be summarized descriptively by Preferred Name based on the FAS. Post- treatment medications will be provided separately in an individual subject data listing. 12.3.2.4 Study Drug Exposure and Compliance Study drug exposure will be summarized overall and by treatment group, based on the Safety Set in terms of the duration of treatment a subject received (in days), defined as the last day – the first day of study drug plus 1, regardless of study drug interruption. Study drug compliance will be summarized overall and by treatment group based on the FAS, and will be calculated as: 100 × [1 - (total number of days of study drug interruption) / (duration of study drug exposure in days)]. A study drug interruption on a given day is defined as an interruption of any study drug on that day. In addition, percentage of tablets taken will also be summarized overall and by treatment group based on the FAS, and will be calculated as 100 × [(total number of tablets dispensed) – (total number of tablets returned) ] / (total number of tablets planned to be taken per day × duration of study drug exposure in days). 12.3.2.5 Important Protocol Deviations An important protocol deviation (IPD) is a deviation that may significantly affect the completeness, accuracy, or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a subject ’s rights, safety, or well-being. The rules for identifying an IPD will be described in the SAP. All IPDs will be provided in an individual subject data listing, and summarized, as appropriate. 12.3.3 Efficacy and Pharmacodynamic Analysis The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of the efficacy of VX-445 in TC with TEZ and IVA. The analyses described in this section will be based on the FAS, unless otherwise specified. 12.3.3.1 Final Analysis 12.3.3.1.1 Analysis of Primary Variables The primary efficacy variable is the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4. The analysis of this variable will be performed using a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) with change from baseline at Day 15, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and Week 24 as the dependent variable. The model will include treatment group, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed effects, with continuous baseline ppFEV 1, age at screening (<18 versus ≥18 years of age) and sex (male versus female) as covariates. The model will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. Denominator degrees of freedom for the F test for fixed effects will be estimated using the Kenward -Roger approximation. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -subject errors. If the model estimation does"
51,page_51,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 52 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated not converge, a compound symmetry covariance structure will be used instead. Conditional on the observed data and covariates, missing data will be assumed to be missing at random; consequently, no imputation of missing data will be performed. The primary result obtained from the model will be the estimated treatment difference at Week 4. The adjusted mean difference at Week 4 with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals and 2-sided P values will be provided. Furthermore, the adjusted mean and treatment difference at each post-baseline visit will also be provided, obtained from the model. Sensitivity analyses for handling missing data will be described in the SAP. Supportive analyses and subgroup analyses of the primary efficacy variable will also be described in the SAP. 12.3.3.1.2 Analysis of Secondary Variables Analysis of Key Secondary Variables The key secondary efficacy variables include: • Absolute change in ppFEV 1 through Week 24: Analysis of this variable will be based on an MMRM model that is exactly the same as the primary efficacy variable. Data obtained from the Day 15, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and Week 24 Visits will be included in the model, however, the Day 15 Visit will not be included in the estimation of the average treatment effect through Week 24. • Number of PE x through Week 24: Analysis of this variable will be performed using a negative binomial regression model with a fixed effect for treatment, as well as continuous baseline ppFEV 1, age at screening (<18 versus ≥18 years of age), and sex (male versus female) as covariates . The logarithm of the subject-specific PEx analysis period duration (defined in the SAP) will be treated as the offset in the model. • Absolute change in SwCl from baseline through Week 24: Analysis of this PD variable will be based on an MMRM model similar to the analysis of the primary efficacy variable. Data obtained from Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 24 Visits will be included in the model and all of these visits will be included in the estimation of the average treatment effect through Week 24. • Absolute change in the CFQ -R respiratory domain score from baseline through Week 24: Analysis of this domain will be based on an MMRM model similar to the analysis of the primary efficacy variable. Data obtained from Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and Week 24 Visits will be included in the model and all of these visits will be included in the estimation of the average treatment effect through Week 24. • Absolute change in BMI from baseline at Week 24: Analysis of this variable will be based on an MMRM model similar to the analysis of the primary efficacy variables.

52,page_52,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 53 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated • Absolute change in CFQ -R respiratory domain score from baseline at Week 4: Analysis of this variable will be based on an MMRM model similar to the analysis of the primary efficacy variable. Data obtained from the Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 24 Visits will be included in the model to e stimate the treatment effect at Week 4. The key secondary endpoints will be formally tested only during the final analysis when all subjects have completed study participation and the primary endpoint is statistically significant either at the IA or at the final analysis. Additional details will be provided in the SAP. Analysis of Other Secondary Variables Other secondary efficacy variables include: • Time-to-first PEx through Week 24: Time-to-first PEx will be analyzed using the Cox regression model. The model will include a fixed effect for treatment, as well as continuous baseline ppFEV 1, age at screening (<18 versus ≥18 years of age), and sex (male versus female) as covariates. A subject who does not experience a PEx during the PEx analysis period will be censored at the PEx analysis period end date. If the proportional hazards assumption is violated for any of the categorical covariates, a stratified Cox regression will be conducted. Additionally, the Kaplan-Meier method will be used to produce a graphical presentation of the cumulative exacerbation -free survival rate for each treatment group and to estimate the cumulative exacerbation -free survival rate by treatment group. Note: If the number of events is <5 in either treatment group, Cox regression will not be performed and the analysis of the time -to-first event will be restricted to the Kaplan -Meier method. • Absolute change in BMI z -score from baseline at Week 24 (for subjects ≤20 years of age at Baseline): Analysis of this variable will be based on an MM RM model similar to the analysis of the primary efficacy variable, for subjects ≤20 years of age at Baseline. Data obtained from Day 15, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and Week 24 Visits will be included in the model. • Absolute change in body weight from baseline at Week 24: Analysis of this variable will be based on an MMRM model similar to the analysis of the primary efficacy variable. Data obtained from Day 15, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and Week 24 Visits will be included in the model. Additional details will be provided in the SAP."

Other details of the model are same as that described for the final analysis ( Section 12.3.3.1). Sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis for the IA will be described in the SAP. 12.3.3.2.2 Analysis of Key Secondary Variables The following key secondary efficacy and pharmacodynamic variables will be analyzed during the IA using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model, and nominal P values will be provided for descriptive purpose: 1. Absolute change in SwCl from baseline at Week 4 2. Absolute change in CFQ- R respiratory domain score from baseline at Week 4 The model will use the change from baseline value at Week 4 as the dependent variable and include treatment group as fixed effects with continuous baseline ppFEV 1, age at screening ( <18 versus ≥18 years of age ), and sex (male versus female) as covariates. Additional details will be provided in the SAP. 12.3.3.3 Multiplicity Adjustment The Lan and DeMets alpha spending function will be applied to the primary endpoint of the absolute change in ppFEV 1 at Week 4 to control the overall type I error rate of 0.05 such that an alpha of 0.01 will be preserved for the fina l analysis .22 If the number of subjects included in the IA is 140, the primary endpoint of the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Week 4 will be tested at an alpha of 0.044 during the IA. The actual alpha at the IA ( α0) will be determined based on the actual number of subjects included in the IA. If the study does not cross the efficacy boundary during the IA ( P value ≥ α0), then the primary endpoint will be tested at an alpha of 0.01 at the final analysis when all subjects complete study participation. The key secondary endpoints will be formally tested at an alpha of 0.05 at the final analysis when all subjects complete study participation only if the primary endpoint is statistically significant at the IA or at the final analysis. A hierarchical testing procedure will be used to control the type I error rate for the multiple key secondary endpoints tested at an alpha of 0.05. For a test at any step to be considered statistically significant within the testing hierarchy, it must be statistically significant, and all previous tests (if any) within the hierarchy must be statistically significant at the 0.05 level. The testing order of the key secondary endpoints is as follows: 1. First key secondary endpoint: Absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through Week 24 2. Second key secondary endpoint: Number of PEx through Week 24 3. Third key secondary endpoint: Absolute change in SwCl from baseline through Week 24 4.

55,page_55,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 56 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated • Grade 3 and Grade 4 TEAEs • Frequently reported TEAEs Summaries will be presented by MedDRA SOC and PT using frequency counts and percenta ges (i.e., number and percentage of subjects with an event). When summarizing the number and percentage of subjects with an event, subjects with multiple occurrences of the same AE or a continuing AE will be counted once, only the maximum severity level will be presented in the severity summaries, and the strongest relationship level in the relationship summaries. In addition, a listing containing individual subject level AE data for all deaths and other serious and significant AEs will be provided separately. All AEs, including pre- and post- treatment AEs, will be presented in individual subject data listings. 12.3.4.2 Clinical Laboratory Assessments For the treatment -emergent laboratory measurements, the observed values and change from baseline values of the continuous hematology, serum chemistry, and coagulation results will be summarized in SI units by treatment group at each visit. The number and percentage of subjects with at least 1 threshold analysis event during the TE Period will be summarized overall and by treatment group. The threshold analysis criterion shift from baseline will also be summarized for select laboratory parameters. The threshold analysis criteria and the parameter selection criteria will be provided in the SAP. Results of urinalysis and pregnancy tests will be listed in individual subject data listings only. In addition, a listing containing individual subject hematology, chemistry, and coagulation val ues will be provided. This listing will include data from scheduled and unscheduled visits. 12.3.4.3 Electrocardiogram For the treatment -emergent ECG measurements, a summary of observed values and change from baseline values will be provided by treatment group, at each visit and time point, as applicable, for the following ECG interval measurements (in msec): RR, PR, QT, and QT corrected for HR (QTcF), QRS duration, and HR (beats per minute).

The number and percentage of subjects with shift changes from baseline (normal/missing and low according to the reference range) to the lowest percent of oxygen saturation during the TE Period will be summarized overall and by treatment group. 12.3.4.6 Physical Examination PE findings will be presented in an individual subject data listing only. 12.3.4.7 Other Safety Analyses Details of other safety analyses will be included in the SAP. 12.3.6 Interim and IDMC Analyses 12.3.6.1 Interim Analyses An IA is planned when at least 140 subjects complete the Week 4 Visit and at least 100 subjects complete the Week 12 Visit. The IA will be performed by an external independent biostatistician who is not involved in and will not influence the conduct of the study, and the results will be reviewed by the IDMC. If the P value for the primary endpoint at the IA is less than α 0, then the efficacy boundary has been crossed. Refer to Section 12.3.3.3 for how α0 is determined. If the IDMC declares that the study has crossed the efficacy boundary, then the study may be unblinded by a limited Vertex team to prepare a regulatory submission(s). Members of the limited Vertex unblinded team will not be involved in or influence the conduct of the remaining part of the study to protect the integrity of the study. The study will continue to completion and remain double-blinded through Week 24. If the study does not cross the efficacy boundary (i.e., the P value for the primary endpoint at the IA is ≥ α 0), the primary endpoint of the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline at Week 4 will be tested after all subjects complete study participation at an alpha of 0.01. The key secondary endpoints will be formally tested only during the final analysis when all subjects have completed study participation and the primary endpoint is statistically significant either at the IA or at the final analysis.

Details of the safety and efficacy review(s) will be described in the IDMC charter. 12.4 Clinical Pharmacology Analysis 12.4.1 Pharmacokinetic Analysis The PK analysis of VX -445, TEZ, and IVA may be performed using nonlinear mixed- effects modeling and/or standard noncompartmental analysis, as data allow. Me tabolites, including M1-TEZ, may be included in the analyses as supported by data. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize PK parameter values for all analytes. A detailed description of the planned PK analysis will be presented in the CPAP. 12.4.2 Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses PD assessments to be included in PK/PD analyses may include SwCl, ppFEV 1, as well as other endpoints such as BMI, BMI z-score, or CFQ-R respiratory domain score. A sequential approach will be used to perform the population PK/PD analysis. The Bayesian estimates of individual PK parameters from the final population PK model will be used to simulate PK profiles for each subject. The simulated VX -445, TEZ, IVA, or metabolite plasma concentrations will be used in the potentia l pharmacological response models to describe changes in each endpoint from baseline. Fixed- and random- effect parameter estimates and the associated asymptotic SEs will be estimated. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize Bayesian estimates of i ndividual PK/PD parameters obtained from the population PK/PD model. 13 PROCEDURAL, ETHICAL, REGULATORY, AND ADMI NISTRATIVE CONSIDERATIONS 13.1 Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Documentation, Severity Grading, and Reporting 13.1.1 Adverse Events 13.1.1.1 Definition of an A dverse Event An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject during the study; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. This includes any newly occurring event or worsening of a pre- existing condition ( e.g., increase in its severity or frequency) after the ICF is signed. An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section 13.1.2.1. 13.1.1.2 Clinically Significant Assessments Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and those deemed to have clinically -significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an AE.

58,page_58,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 59 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased hemoglobin). An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1 or more of the following: • Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment • Further diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention • A change in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by the investigator. A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4 laboratory value will be an SAE if the subject’ s clinical status indicates a life -threatening AE. 13.1.1.3 Documentation of Adverse Events All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the subject completes study participation, as defined in Section 9.1.6. All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 1 overall event o r diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the CRF and source document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled in the study will be recorded only in the subject’s source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE: • Description of the event • Classification of “serious” or “nonserious” • Date of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable) • Severity • Causal relationship to study drug(s) • Action taken • Outcome • Concomitant medication or other treatment given 13.1.1.4 Adverse Event Severity The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Ver sion 4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm (Accessed 28 September 2017). AEs of CTCAE Gr ades 4 and 5 will be documented as “ life-threatening. ” In considering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in the"
59,page_59,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 60 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated CTCAE. The severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in Table 13-1. Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity Classification Definition Mild (Grade 1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities Moderate (Grade 2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities Severe (Grade 3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities Life-threatening (Grade 4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death 13.1.1.5 Adverse Event Causality Every effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2. Table 13-2 Classifications for AE Causality Classification Definition Related There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, and/or the event reappeared on re- exposure to the investigational stud y drug. Possibly related There is an association between the event and the administration of the investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative eti ology, such as characteristics of the subject ’s clinical status or underlying disease. Unlikely related The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be related to factors other than investigational study drug. Not related The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject’ s medical record). 13.1.1.6 Study Drug Action Taken The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3. Table 13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE Classification Definition Dose not changed Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE Dose reduced Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE Drug interrupted Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE Drug withdrawn Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE Not applicable Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply. “Not applicable ” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible."

The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-4. Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE Classification Definition Recovered/resolved Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms Recovered/resolved with sequelae Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms Not recovered/not resolved (continuing) Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains ongoing Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at leas t possibly related to the AE. Unknown Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to follow -up) 13.1.1.8 Treatment Given The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. 13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 13.1.2.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse E vent An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes: • Fatal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study drug) • Life-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred • Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization • Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined a s a substantial disruption of a person’ s ability to conduct normal life functions) • Congenital anomaly or birth defect • Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical inter vention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed"
61,page_61,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 62 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated above (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home) If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that occurred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned before the subject signed the ICF, the hospitalization or procedure will not be considered to indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled sooner or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be considered to indicate an SAE. Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “ severe” because they are not synonymous. The term “ severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject ’s life or functionin g. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations. 13.1.2.2 Documentation of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through completion of study participation, regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to Vertex GPS. In addition, all SAEs that occur after completion of study participation and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours. SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form ”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relationship to the investigational study drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex t he outcome of the event using the SAE Form. 13.1.2.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, regardless of the presumed relationship to the investigational study drug. The SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow -up information on previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow-up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health authoritie s. Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via: Email: (preferred choice) Fax: For questions, contact telephone:"

The method of obtaining and documenting the informed consent and assent (if applicable) and the contents of the consent will comply with ICH GCP and all applicable laws and regulations and will be subject to approval by Vertex or its designee. When determining the age of the subject, other stud y eligibility criteria, and timing of collection applicable assessments, the informed consent will be used as the reference (e.g., age at time of informed consent, date of informed consent, timing of AE collection). 13.2.3 Investigator Compliance No modifications to the protocol will be made without the approval of both the investigator and Vertex. Changes that significantly affect the safety of the subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the study (i.e., efficacy assessments) will r equire IRB/IEC notification before implementation, except where the modification is necessary to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to human subjects. Vertex will submit all protocol modifications to the required regulatory authorities. When circumstan ces require an immediate departure from procedures set forth in the protocol, the investigator will contact Vertex to discuss the planned course of action. If possible, contact will be made before the implementation of any changes. Any departures from the protocol will be fully documented in the source documentation and in a protocol deviation log."

The records will also be available for direct inspection, verification, and copying, as required by applicable laws and regulations, by officials of the regulatory health authorities (FDA and others). The investigator will comply with applicable privacy and security laws for use and disclosure of information related to the research set forth in this protocol. 13.2.5 Subject Privacy To maintain subject confidentiality and to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations, all CRFs, study reports, and communications relating to the study will identify subjects by assigned subject numbers and access to subject names linked to such numbers shall be limited to the site and the stu dy physician and shall not be disclosed to Vertex. As required by applicable laws and regulations in the countries in which the study is being conducted, the investigator will allow Vertex and/or its representatives access to all pertinent medical records to allow for the verification of data gathered in the CRFs/SAE Forms and the review of the data collection process. The FDA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, including the IRB/IEC, may also request access to all study records, including source documentation, for inspection. For sites participating in the study in the US, and in accordance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and associated regulations, an executed HIPAA authorization shall be obtained by the site from each subject (or the legal representative of the subject) before research activities may begin. Each HIPAA authorization shall comply with all HIPAA requirements including authorization allowing the site access to and use of the subject’ s personally identifiable health information, authorization for the site to disclose such information to Vertex, the FDA, and other parties requiring access under the protocol, and statements as to the purpose for which such information may be used and for how long. 13.2.6 Record Retention The investigator will maintain all study records according to ICH GCP guidelines and/or applicable local regulatory requirement(s), whichever is longest, as described in the Clinical Trial Agreement. If the investigator withdraws from th e responsibility of keeping the study records, custody will be transferred to a person willing to accept the responsibility and Vertex will be notified. 13.2.7 Study Termination At any time, Vertex may terminate this study in its entirety or may terminate this study at any particular site. In addition, for reasonable cause, either the investigators or their IRBs/IECs may terminate the study at their center. Conditions that may lead to reasonable cause and warrant termination include, but are not limited to: • Subject or investigator noncompliance • Unsatisfactory subject enrollment • Lack of adherence to protocol procedures"
64,page_64,"Protocol VX17-445-102, Version 3 .0 Page 65 of 73 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated • Lack of evaluable and/or complete data • Potentially unacceptable risk to study subjects • Decision to modify drug development plan • Decision by the FDA or other regulatory authority Written notification that includes the reason for the clinical study termination is required. 13.2.8 End of Study The end of study is defined as the last scheduled visit or, for subjects who have been lost to follow-up, the last cont act, whichever occurs later, for the latest completing subject in the study. 13.3 Data Quality Assurance Vertex or its designated representative will conduct a study site visit to verify the qualifications of each investigator, inspect clinical study site facilities, and inform the investigator of responsibilities and procedures for ensuring adequate and correct study documentation. The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study participant. Study data for each enrolled subject will be entered into a CRF by study site personnel using a secure, validated, web -based electronic data capture (EDC) application. Vertex will have read -only access to site- entered clinical data in the EDC application. Instances of missing, discrepant, or uninterpretable data will be queried with the investigator for resolution. Any changes to study data will be made to the CRF and documented in an audit trail, which will be maintained within the clinical database. 13.4 Monitoring Monitoring and auditing procedures developed or approved by Vertex will be followed to comply with GCP guidelines. On-site checking of the CRFs/SAE Forms for completeness and clarity, cros s-checking with source documents, and clarification of administrative matters will be performed. The study will be monitored by Vertex or its designee. Monitoring will be done by personal visits from a representative of Vertex, or designee (study site monitor), who will review the CRFs/SAE Forms and source documents. The study site monitor will ensure that the investigation is conducted according to the protocol design and regulatory requirements. Protocol deviations will be monitored and identified throughout study conduct as outlined in the Protocol Deviation Plan. 13.5 Electronic Data Capture Vertex will provide the study sites with secure access to and training on the EDC application sufficient to permit study site personnel to enter or correct informa tion in the CRFs on the subjects for which they are responsible. A CRF will be completed for each enrolled study subject. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure the accuracy, completeness, clarity, and timeliness of the data reported in the subject ’s CRF. Source documentation supporting the CRF data will indicate the subject’ s participation in"

A mutation is considered an MF mutation if it meets at least 1 of the following 2 criteria: (1) biological plausibility of no translated protein (genetic sequence predicts the complete absence of CFTR protein), or (2) in vitro testing that supports lack of responsiveness to TEZ, IVA, or TEZ/IVA, and evidence of clinical severity on a population basis (as reported in large patient registries). Inclusion of MF Mutations Based on In Vitro Testing Mutations that were considered to be MF mutations based on in vitro testing met the following criteria in in vitro experiments: • baseline chloride transport that was <10% of wildtype CFTR • an increase in chloride transport of <10% over baseline following the addition of TEZ, IVA, or TEZ/IVA in the assay These mutations also had evidence of clinical severity on a population basis (per CFTR2 patient registry; accessed on 15 February 2016). Patients with these mutations on one alle le and F508del on the other allele exhibited evidence of clinical severity as defined as: • average sweat chloride >86 mmol/L, and • prevalence of pancreatic insufficiency (PI) >50% These clinical severity criteria do not apply to the individual subjects to be enrolled in the study, but were used to categorize each mutation on a population level. Eligible MF Mutations The list below represents acceptable mutations, which are detectable by an FDA -cleared genotyping assay or other method (e.g., sequencing); however, this list may not include every eligible mutation, and investigators should contact the medical monitor regarding other mutations that may also meet study eligibility criteria."
