Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Objectives • To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic effects of 24 weeks of relugolix 40 mg once daily when co-administered with either 12 or 24 weeks of low- dose estr adiol and norethindrone acetate. Exploratory Objectives • To determine the benefit of 24 weeks of relugolix 40 mg once daily co - administered with either 12 or 24 weeks of low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate compared with placebo on patient-reported quality of life outcome measures (EQ-5D-5L). Study Design This study is an international phase 3 , randomized, double- blind, placebo- controlled efficacy and safety study to evaluate 24 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily co -administered with low- dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate and 12 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily followed by 12 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily co -administered with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate compared with 24 weeks of placebo. Approximately 390 women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated w ith uterine fibroids will be enrolled and randomized 1:1:1 to the relugolix plus low-dose hormonal add- back therapy group ( Group A; N ≈ 130) , the relugolix monotherapy followed by co- administration with low-dose hormonal add- back therapy group (Group B; N ≈ 130), or placebo group (Group C ; N ≈ 130). Stratification variables will include : geographic region (North America versus Rest of World) and mean screening menstrual blood loss volume (< 225 mL versus ≥ 225 mL ) by the alkaline hematin method . The study consists of a screening period (up to ~ 13 weeks), a randomized t reatment period (24 weeks), and a follow-up period (~30 days ). Additionally, unscheduled follow-up visit(s) may be arranged for patients with study- related safety concerns and as needed. A diagnosis of uterine fibroids will be confirmed during the s creening period by centrally -reviewed transvaginal ultrasound (with or without a transabdominal ultrasound) . Heavy menstrual bleeding will be defined as menstrual blood loss of ≥ 80 mL per cycle for 2 cycles or ≥ 160 mL during 1 cycle during the screening period . Women with iron- deficient microcytic anemia and hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL and ≤ 10 g/dL during Screening must be treated with oral or parenteral iron replacement therapy .

At the Screening, Week 12, and Week 24 visits , patient s will have an assessment of bone mineral density with dual- energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) . An endometrial biopsy will also be performed at Screening . Another trans vaginal ultrasound (with or without a trans abdominal ultrasound) will be performed at Week 24, followed by a repeat endometrial biopsy . Patients will have paired baseline and end-of- treatment endometrial biopsies , independent of ultrasound results. Feminine products will be standardized and will be collected and assessed for blood loss by the alkaline hematin method. Complete blood counts and chemistries will be collected mon thly and uterine fibroid volumes will be assessed at the Screening and Week 24 visits. Patients will complete daily electronic diaries (eDiary) including compliance with study treatment, menstrual bleeding, use of feminine products for menstrual bleeding, uterine fibroid-associated pain by the Numerical Rating Scale, and use of pain medication to treat pain caused by uterine fibroids. Quality of life questionnaires will be completed according to the Schedule of Activities. Safety will be assessed througho ut the study by monitoring adverse events, vital signs, physical exam inations including visual acuity , clinical laboratory tests, 12- lead electrocardiograms, endometrial biops ies, and assessments of bone mineral density . Height will be measured at the Screening 1 visit and weight will be measured at specified intervals . Samples will be collect ed for PK assessment of relugolix, estradiol, and norethindrone and for the pharmacodynamic assessment of luteinizing hormone (LH) , follicle -stimulating hormone (F SH), estradiol, and progesterone . During the Randomized Treatment Period, study participants will take the blinded study treatment (1 tablet and 1 capsule) orally once daily for 24 weeks. The last dose of study drug for the Randomized Treatment Period will be taken on the day immediately before to the Week 24 visit. Eligible patients, including women randomized to placebo, will be offered the opportunity to enroll in a 28-week open-l abel extension study where patients will receive relugolix co-administered with low- dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate. Patients who do not enroll into the extension study will have a Follow-U p visit approximately 30 days after the patient’s last dose of study drug. Patients who are not proceeding to the extension study and who have endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer on the endometrial biopsy or bone mineral density loss of > 2% at the lumbar spine (L1-L4) or total hip a t their Week 24/Early Termination visit relative to the baseline measurement will undergo further testing and follow-u p to evaluate recovery (see Section 6.6). Patients whose menses has not resumed as of the Follow-Up visit for unexplained reasons (eg, not explained by concomitant medications or medical procedures) will be contacted by telephone to determine if menses has resumed (see Section 6.6). Patients with reductions in visual acuity will be referred for ophthalmology consultation (see Section 6.8.2.8). Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Inclusion Criteria (all inclusion criteria must have been met prior to randomization unless otherwise specified): 1.

Safety Safety assessments will include treatment -emergent adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiograms, endometrial biopsies, and assessments of bone mineral density . Safety analyses will be based on all randomized patients who receive any amount of study drug (s afety population). Drug exposure will be summarized by descriptive statistics. Severity of all treatment -emergent adverse events will be evaluated by the investigator based on the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and will be coded to preferred term, higher level term, and system organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The number and percentage of patients with adverse events will be presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term, relationship to study drug , and severity. Descriptive statistics will be used rather than inferential statistics. Laboratory values also will be classified by toxicity grad e based on the National Cancer Institute’s CTCAE. Laboratory shift tables of the B aseline results to each of the subsequent visits will be produced. Bone mineral density will be evaluated in all patients at the lumbar spine (L1- L4), total hip , and femora l neck at the Baseline, Week 12 , and Week 24 visits and the absolute, percent, and standardized changes from baseline will be summarized. Vasomotor adverse events will be separately summarized. A chartered independent Data and Safet y Monitoring Board will monitor all available safety data, including bone density assessments, on an ongoing basis during this study. Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics The PK concentration data ( relugolix, estradiol, and norethindrone pre-dose ) and pharmacodynamics concentration data ( LH, FSH , estradiol, and progesterone pre -dose) will be listed and summar ized by treatment arm and visit.

Uterine F ibroids with Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Uterine leiomyomas (often referred to as fibroids or myomas) are common benign, estrogen - dependent tumors that grow in the muscular wall of the uterus and occur in approximately 25% of women of reproductive age . While the majority of uterine fibroids are asymptomatic, approximately 25% of women with fibroids develop symptoms requiring treatment. The most problematic symptom for women with uterine fibroids is heavy menstrual bleeding, with menstrual periods of increased duration and volume. In women with uterine fibroids, menstrual periods can last as long as 10 to 14 days rather than the usual 5 to 7 days , and blood loss can be as high as 300 to 500 mL , with anythin g more than 80 mL during a given cycle considered abnormal. The heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids is likely caused by the increase in surface area of the uterine cavity, poor uterine contraction due to the myoma, and increased circulation, congestion, or impaired hemostasis due to hypertrophy of the endometrium near the myoma [Hapangama, 2016]. Persistent heavy m enstrual bleeding can induce iron - deficiency anemia and associated fatigue and loss of energy . Heavy menstrual bleeding is a primary reason for the deteriorat ion in the health -related quality of life assessed in patients with uterine fibroids and is a major cause of elective hysterectomy. Other symptoms include bulk symptoms , such as pain or pressure in the abdomen and pelvis due to large myoma(s), low back pain, urinary frequency or urinary tract obstruction , constipation, and pregnancy loss. The incidence of uterine fibroids increases as women grow older, and risk factors include nullipari ty, obesity, family history, black race, and hypertension. Fibroids typically arise during the reproductive years, tend to enlarge during pregnancy and regress after menopause as these tumors are dependent upon estrogen and progesterone for their growth . Transvaginal ultrasound is used most commonly to diagnose these benign tumors, and magnetic resonance imaging, sonohysterography, and hysteroscopy are used to evaluate their size and position. The type of treatment recommended for uterine fibroids typically depends upon their size, location, the patient’s age, reproductive plans , and obstetrical history. Few medical options are available for women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and approximately 60% of women who received medical therapy in one study underwent a surgical procedure within 2 years [Marjoribanks , 2006], suggesting many women are inadequately treated with the currentl y available medical therapies. Combined hormonal contraceptives and progestational agents are commonly prescribed to regulat e abnormal uterine bleeding, but appear to have limited efficacy in the treatment of uterine fibroids [ Carr, 1993]. Although no randomized studie s evaluating the use of levonorgestrel- releasing intrauterine system devices for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding related to uterine fibroids have been conducted, observational studies have reported a reduction in uterine volume and bleeding and this system is approved for use by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists such as leuprolide acetate (also known as leuprorelin) are effective in lowering estrogen and progesterone levels, decreasing menstrual bleeding, and decreasing fibroid size, however they cannot be used for more than 6 months due to bone mineral density loss from the resulting hypo estrogenic state. The GnRH agonists, which Myovant Sciences GmbH 27 CONFIDENTIAL MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 53"

This initial rise in hormonal levels is followed by a gradual decline in levels over 4 weeks as the pituitary becomes desensitized to the chronic stimulation of the GnRH agonist and LH and FSH level s fall. Other medical treatments are used but have limited clinical effectiveness, including tranexamic acid, aromatase inhibitors, non- steroidal anti- inflammatory medications, and danazol. The current mainstay of treatment for women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine f ibroids is surgery. Several surgical procedures are frequently performed including myomectomy by various techniques, endometrial ablation, endometrial uterine artery embolization, and magnetic resonance- guided focused-ultrasound surgery. Each of these procedures has complications. For example, abdominal myomectomy result s in complications requiring hysterectomy in up to 3 to 4% of cases, along with the frequent development of intraoperative adhesions [Gliklich , 2011 ]. Furthermore, recurrence after myomectomy is common with at least 25% of women requiring additional treatment [Stewart , 2015, Marret , 2012, ACOG Practice Bulleti n No. 96, 2008]. Hysterectomy is the definitive procedure and more tha n 250,000 hysterectomies are performed in the US for uterine fibroids. M ajor complications h ave been reported to occur in up to 25% of women undergoing hysterectomy, including infection, severe bleeding, and injuries to the urethra, bowel or bladder. One study showed that among women with Medicaid insurance who underwent abdominal hysterectomy, there was a 10% risk of transfusion and up to a 28% risk of medical or surgical complications including major blood loss, wound infection and febrile episodes [ Gliklich , 2011]. Approximately 3 million women in the United States suffer from symptomatic uterine fibroids that are inadequately treated with medical therapy , and related US health care costs for uterine fibroids exceeds $34 billion [ Stewart , 2015; Cardozo, 2012, Gliklich , 2011 ]. There is a great need for a medicine that can decrease the symptoms of uterine fibroids and can be safely administered so that women have an option other than surgical procedures such as myomectomy and hysterectom y. 2.2. Relugolix 2.2.1. Indicat ion Relugolix co-admini s tered wi th low-dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate is being developed as a once daily oral medication for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. The proposed dose of relugolix is 40 mg administered orally once daily and the proposed doses of estradiol and norethindrone acetate are 1 mg and 0.5 mg once daily, respectively . 2.2.2. Pharmac ology Relugolix (also known as TAK-385) is an orally -active, potent, highly- selective high-affinity small molecule GnRH receptor antagonist with a novel structure. Relugolix was discovered and initially studied by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Limited, before development rights outside of Japan and certain East Asian countries were licensed to Myovant Sciences GmbH .

55,page_55,"Clinical Study Protocol: MVT -601-3001 Amendment 2, Effective: 18- SEP-2017 Relugolix anta gonizes the human GnRH receptors present on the gonadotropin -secreting cells of the anterior pituitary by competitively inhibiting binding of the active ligand, GnRH, to the GnRH receptors. In the absence of GnRH- stimulated secretion by the anterior pitui tary, levels of LH and FSH f all rapidly, followed by a decline over a few days in estradiol and progesterone levels . Relugolix acts as a potent and highly selective antagonist for the human GnRH receptor. The affinity of relugolix for the human GnRH receptor in vitro was approximately 50-fold higher than that of GnRH in the presence of protein (40% fetal bovine serum). Transgenic knock-in mice expressing the human GnRH receptor treated with relugolix had substantial reductions in reproductive organ weights of both female and male mice, suggesting that relugolix may suppress blood estrogen and testosterone levels, respectively. Orally administered relugolix suppressed the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in castrated cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 1 mg /kg and higher. 2.2.3. Nonclin ical Toxicology A comprehensive package of nonclinical studies has been conducted to evaluate the toxicity of relugol ix. These include repeat -dose toxicity studies in mice of up to 13 weeks, in rats of up to 26 weeks, and in monkeys of up to 39 weeks. Oral administration of relugolix resulted in reversible liver toxicity (liver enzyme elevations with and without accompanying histopathological correlates) and changes related to reversible phospholipidosis (PLD) in several tissues/organs, most notably the lymph nodes, lungs, and testes in rats; and lymph nodes, parietal cells in the stomach, spleen, and intestines in monkeys. P LD by itself is not adverse, and no significant adverse effects were associated with PLD in rats and monkeys except at doses that caused mortality in rats (≥ 1000 mg /kg/day), which were associated with extremely high systemic exposures. The no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for liver findings in the 39- week monkey toxicity study was 5 mg/kg/day , and the no-observed-adverse- effect level (NOAEL) is considered to be 15 mg /kg/day. The gender combined mean end of study area under the concentration -time curve from time 0 to 24 hours ( AUC 0-24) at the NOAEL of 15 mg/kg/day was 5.2 μg⋅hr/mL, which is ~51 times higher than the estimated exposure (AUC) in women receiving 40 mg once daily (0.101 μg ⋅hr/mL), the dose of relugolix to be administered in this study. Both the liver and PLD findings demonstrated evidence of reversibility following a 13- week recovery period in monkeys. No evidence of PLD has been observed in clinical studies. The relugolix toxicology program supports the conduct of clinical studies up to the NOAEL (15 mg /kg/day) exposure (5.2 μg ⋅hr/mL) for liver toxicity in monkeys (most sensitive speci es). Relugolix is not mutagenic or clastogenic and was not carcinogenic in 2 -year mouse and rat studies. Embryo-fetal death was observed only in relugolix-treated pregnant rabbits, but no fetal malformation was observed in rat and rabbit embryo- fetal development studies. While relugolix demonstrated phototoxic potential in an in vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake assay, in vivo data did not show phototoxicity in hairless mice, and no damage to the eye structure or function was evident in the 4- and 39-week monkey toxicity studies. Prolongation of the corrected QT interval was observed in a study of cynomolgus monkeys at ≥ 100 mg/kg (estimated C max of 4.0 µg/mL), but did not prolong the QT interval in a human thorough QT study at doses up to 360 mg (C max of 0.181 µg/mL).

Previous Human Experience Nine phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and 3 phase 2 studies (including 1 in women with uterine f ibroids and 1 in women with endometriosis) have been completed. In addition, 6 clinical studies evaluating relugolix are ongoing, including 2 phase 1 studies, 2 phase 2 studies in men with prostate cancer (US and Europe), and 2 phase 3 studies in women with uterine fibroids in Japan. More than 1380 patients and healthy volunteers have received at least 1 dose of relugolix , including 158 women receiving relugolix 40 mg once daily (the propose d phase 3 dose) for at least 28 days and at least 200 men receiving relugolix at doses of 80 mg or 120 mg once daily for at least 24 weeks and for as long as 48 weeks . Eighty -e ight women have been treated w ith rel ugolix 40 mg once daily for 24 weeks. 2.2.4.1. Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics, and Metabolism Data from phase 1 studies demonstrate that relugolix treatment results in rapid, dose -dependent suppression of estradiol in female subjects and testosterone in male subjects. After oral administration, the absolute bioavailability of relugolix was 12% (range 6 to 25%) with a predominant elimination half-life of 37 to 42 hours. In a human radiolabeled study, there were no major circulating metabolites of relugolix. The primary route of elimination of drug -related material was in the feces. The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics of relugolix have been evaluat ed, and appear to be similar in American and Japanese volunteers, despite the lower mean body mass index observed in Japanese volunteers. A phase 1 study ( TAK -385_101) in he althy US premenopausal women demonstrated the tolerability of single doses of relugolix 1 to 80 mg , and once-daily dosing of relugolix at 10, 20, and 40 mg for 2 weeks. Plasma concentrations of relugolix increased in a slightly greater than dose-proportional manner. Suppression of serum estradiol was similar after single doses of 40 or 80 mg once daily relugolix. The serum concentrations of LH, FSH, estradiol, and progesterone rapidly decreased and remained at low levels with multiple doses of relugolix with the majority of women having estradiol levels < 10 pg/mL in the 40-mg dose group. Based on these hormone reductions, oral relugolix 40 mg once daily was chosen as the high dose for further study in phase 2. A 6-week phase 1 study (MVT-601-1001) in healthy US premenopausal women was conducted to evalu ate the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics profile of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily and relugolix 40 mg once daily in combination with estradiol/norethindrone acetate (1 mg /0.5 mg once daily ). Median pre-dose trough concentrations of estradiol in the relugolix alone arm were ~6 pg/mL; with the addition of 1 mg estradiol once daily , these were increased to ~26 pg/mL, and median peak concentrations were ~45 pg/mL. This trough and peak concentration range is consistent with the estradiol range associated with reduced loss of bone mineral density [Barbieri , 1992]. Relugolix PK and norethindrone acetate PK were similar to historic data. The estrogeni c metabolite of norethindrone, ethinyl estradiol, was below the limit of quantitation in almost all PK samples collected. The adverse event profile was similar to prior phase 1 studies, with a marked reduction in hot flushes noted in the relugolix plus hormonal add-back therapy in comparison with the relugolix alone arm. Relugolix is to be administered in the fasted state, as food decreases the extent of relugolix absorption (AUC) by approximately 19%. The exposure of relugolix is increased by inhibitors Myovant Sciences GmbH 30 CONFIDENTIAL MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 56"

In a dedicated study, relugolix did not prolong the corrected (QTc) interval. 2.2.4.2. Clinical Studies in Women with Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis and Men with Prostate Cancer A phase 2 study (TAK-385/CCT- 001) evaluated the efficacy, safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics of relugolix 10, 20, and 40 mg once daily for 12 weeks in 216 Japanese women with uterine fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding . Heavy menstrual bleeding was defined for enrollment into the stu dy as a score on the Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBAC) of at least 120 ; uterine fibroids were confirmed by ultras ound, magnetic resonance imaging , computed tomography , or laparoscopy. For the primary endpoint (proportion of patients with a total PBAC score of < 10 from Week 6 to 12), statistically significant dose-dependent differences were observed in all relugolix treatment groups compared to placebo ( Figure 2-1). The proportion was hig her in the relugolix 40 mg group (83.6%) compared with 0% in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). In the relugolix 20 mg group, 43.6% of women responded and in the 10 mg group 20.8% responded, demon strating a dose-response relationship. Of the women in the relugolix 40 mg group, 72.7% achieved amenorrhea from Week 6 to Week 12. Similarly, improvement with increasing dose was also observed in the secondary endpoints including change in myoma and uterine volumes and blood concentration of hemoglobin.

58,page_58,"Clinical Study Protocol: MVT -601-3001 Amendment 2, Effective: 18- SEP-2017 In the phase 2 uterine fibroid study, the most common treatment -emergent adverse events (occurring > 10% in any treatment group and more than placebo) were hot flush, metrorrhagia, menorrhagia, headache, genital hemorrhage, menstruation irregular and nasopharyngitis. With the exception of the incidence of nasopharyngitis in all treatment groups, t hese common adverse events were thought to be caused by the pharmacological effect of relugolix. The adverse events associated with menstruation were pri marily reported in the first 28 days . Most of the adverse events were mild or moderate, and no serious treatment- emergent adverse event considered related to study drug w as observed. Adverse events resulted in study drug discontinuation in 2 patients (hemoglobin decreased in a placebo patient and tinnitus, libido decreased, menopausal depression and hyperhidrosis in one patient treated with relugolix 20 mg once daily ). Bone mineral de nsity decreases appeared to correlate with increasing doses of relugolix. Women treated with placebo for 12 weeks had a mild loss of bone mineral density (mean ± standard deviation [ SD]) of -0.24 ± 2.218% compared with -0.75 ± 2.350%, -2.01 ± 2.334%, and -2.28 ± 2.194% in the relugolix 10, 20, and 40 mg once daily groups, respectively . One patient had a positive pregnancy test after receiving approximate ly 46 days of relugolix 10 mg once daily (a dose that does not fully suppress estradiol). Study drug was discontinued. An ultrasound determined that the patient was 7 weeks pregnant. The patient subsequently had an uneventful pregnancy and delivered a healthy infant at 39 weeks. In a phase 2 study of women with endometriosis (TAK -385/CCT -101), 487 women were randomized to relugolix doses of 10, 20, or 40 mg or placebo , administered orally once daily over a 12-week period, or to leuprolide acetate ( every 4-week injection ) administered for 12 weeks. The study demonstrated dose- dependent decreases in pelvic pain as assessed by a 100 mm visual analogue score (VAS). The pain scores for pelvic pain were well -balanced across the groups at baseli ne and the means ranged from 14.6 to 15.6 mm. The changes from baseline in the VAS score (mean ± SD) were -10.418 ± 1 1.0171 mm in the relugolix 40 mg group vs. - 3.753 ± 10.5018 mm in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). All doses were better than placebo, with the greatest benefit observed at the highest dose evaluated, 40 mg once daily. The decrease in mean VAS pain score for the leuprolide group (-10.460 ± 10.3013 mm ) was similar to that of the relugolix 40 mg group. The effects of relugolix on pain were maintained following an additional 12 weeks of treatment in the extension study (total of 24 weeks). Estradiol le vels were suppressed for the duration of the study. In the 12- week phase 2 endometriosis study (CCT -101) and the companion 12-week extension study ( OCT -101; total of 24 weeks of treatment), the safety p rofile of the relugolix 40 mg once daily dose was comparable to that of leuprolide treatment. The mo st commonly reported treatment -emergent adverse events in the relugolix groups than in the placebo group included hot flush, metrorrhagia, and menstruation irregular , and were considered to be due to the pharmacological effects of relugolix . The events of menstrual bleeding were primarily reported in the first 28 days . Bone mineral density changes from baseline (mean ± standard deviation [SD] ) observed after 24 weeks of treatment were -0.23 ± 1.986% in the placebo group, -1.61 ± 2.338%, -2.58 ± 2.936%, and -4.90 ± 2.912% in the relugolix 10, 20, and 40 mg groups respectively, and -4.43 ± 2.157% in the leuprolide group. Bone mineral density changes from baseline in the relugolix 40 mg group at 12 and 24 we eks w ere comparable to those in the leuprolide group for the same durations. Two patients had liver test abnormalities considered study drug- related by the investigator and that resulted in discontinuation of study drug.

59,page_59,"Clinical Study Protocol: MVT -601-3001 Amendment 2, Effective: 18- SEP-2017 Two phase 3 studies evaluating relugolix in women with uterine fibroids are ongoing in Japan. One study is assessing the effect of relugolix in women with moderate to severe pain associated with uterine fibroids, and the other is evaluating women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. Data from these ongoing studies are not available. Two phase 2 clinical studies of relugolix (C27002 and C27003) in men with advanced pros tate canc er requiring androgen deprivation therapy were initiated in North America in 2014. Study C27002, which remains ongoing, enrolled patients with advanced prosta te cancer. In this open- label, parallel g roup study, men were randomized to receive oral relugolix at a dose of 80 mg or 120 mg once daily after a single oral loading dose of 320 mg (N = 50 in each arm) or to the GnRH agonist therapy, leuprolide acetate, 22.5 mg administered s ubcutaneously every 12 weeks, (N = 25) for up to 48 weeks. Study C27003, in which the last clinical study visits have been completed, enrolled men in North America or the United Kingdom requiring six months of androgen deprivation therapy as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy to external beam radiation therapy. Patients were randomized to relugolix 120 mg once daily (after a s ingle oral loading dose of 320 mg ) (N = 65) or to degarelix 80 mg subcutaneously every four weeks (N = 38) for 24 weeks (after a single loading dose of 240 mg ). Results from the C27002 final analysis demonstrated that both doses of oral relugolix, 80 mg and 120 mg once daily, rapidly reduced testosterone levels below the castration threshold (≤ 50 ng/dL) and maintained these levels through at least 24 weeks. These 24- week data were comparable to testosterone levels achieved by leuprolide 22.5 mg administered by injection every 3 months. Study C27003 also demonstrated rapid and sustained suppression of testosterone levels by relugolix for the 24- week treatment duration. In an interim analysis of the phase 2 prostate cancer study C27002, the most common treatment-emergent adverse events occurring in at least 10% of men with advanced prostate cancer in the relugolix 80 mg or 120 mg once daily arms or leuprolide arm included hot flush, alanine aminotransferase increase, fatigue, aspartate aminotransferase, diabetes mellitus, hyperhidrosis, muscle spasm, injection site reaction , and frequent daytime urination. The common adverse events observed with relugolix in men with prostate cancer were generally consistent with its mechanism of action and those observed with leupro lide. A biomarker f or PLD, di-22:6- bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate (di-22:6- BMP ), was monitored in this study due to findings of PLD in nonclinical toxicity studies. There were no systematic in creases in post -baseline serum or urinary di-22:6-BMP levels and no c hanges exceeding 2 -fold observed in any patients. No clinical evidence of relugolix -related PLD -as sociated toxicity has been observed regarding the heart, liver, central nervous system, or muscle in any clinical study. Relugolix has been generally well tolerated. Adverse drug reactions associated with relugolix in women with uterine fibroids or endometriosis include hot flush, headache, hyperhidrosis and bone density decreased . Adverse drug reactions associated with relugolix in men with prostate cancer include hot flush, fatigue, arthralgia, nausea, weight increased , gynecomastia and night sweats. More detailed description of the results of phase 1 and phase 2 studies in women with uterine fibroids and endometriosis and in men with prostate cancer are provided in the r elugolix Investigator Brochure, along with a full discussion of the safety profile of relugolix.

Overall S tudy Design This study is an international phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety s tudy to evaluate 24 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily co -administered with lo w- dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate and 12 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily followed by 12 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily co -administered with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate compared with 24 weeks of placebo. Approximately 390 women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids will be enrolled and randomized 1:1:1 to the relugolix plus low-dose hormonal add-back therapy group (Group A; N ≈ 130), the relugolix monotherapy followed by co- administration with low -dose hormonal add- back therapy group (Group B; N ≈ 130), or placebo group (Group C; N ≈ 130). Stratification variables will include: geographic region (North America versus Rest of World) and mean screening menstrual blood loss volume (< 225 mL versus ≥ 225 mL) by the alkaline hematin method. The study consists of a screening period (up to ~13 weeks), a randomized treatment period (24 weeks) , and a follow-up period (~30 days). Additionally, unscheduled follow-up visit(s) may be arranged for pat ients with study -related safety concerns and as needed. A diagnosis of uterine fibroids will be confirmed during the screening period by centrally-reviewe d transvaginal ultrasound (with or without a transabdominal ultrasound). Heavy menstrual bleeding will be defined as menstrual blood loss of ≥ 80 mL per cycle for 2 cycles or ≥ 160 mL during 1 cycle during the screening period. Women with iron- deficient microcytic anemia and hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL and ≤ 10 g/dL during Screening must be treated with oral or parenteral iron replacement therapy. Between the Baseline Day 1 and Week 24 visits, patients will attend visits monthly (ie, every 4 weeks). At the Screening, Week 12, and Week 24 visits, patients will have an assessment of bone mineral density with dual- energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA). An endometrial biopsy will also be performed at Screening. Another transvaginal ultrasound (with or without a transabdominal ultrasound) will be performed at Week 24, followed by a repeat endometrial biopsy. Patients will have paired baseline and end -of-treatment endometrial biopsies, independent of ultrasound results. Feminine products will be standardized and will be collected and assessed for blood loss by the alkaline hematin method. Complete blood counts and che mistries will be collected monthly and uterine fibroid volumes will be assessed at the Screening and Week 24 visits. Patients will complete daily electronic diaries (eDiary) including compliance with study treatment, menstrual bleeding, use of feminine products for menstrual bleeding, uterine fibroid- associated pain by the Numerical Rating Scale, and use of pain medication to treat pain caused by uterine fibroids. Quality of life questionnaires will be completed according to the Schedule of Activities. Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring adverse events, vital signs, physical examina tions including visual acuity, clinical laboratory tests, 12 -lead electrocardiograms, endometrial biopsies, and assessments of bone mineral density. Heig ht will be measured at the Screening 1 visit and weight will be measured at specified intervals. Samples will be collected for PK assessment of relugolix, estradiol, and norethindrone and for the pharmacodynamic assessment of luteinizing hormone (LH), foll icle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol, and progesterone.

Discussion of Study Design, Including Dosing Rationale and Choice of Control Grou p This phase 3 study is one of two replicate studies designed to establish the efficacy and safety of relugolix 40 mg once daily in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. This study will focus on the primary objective of demonstrating a reduction in heavy menstrual bleeding, the most common and burdensome symptom of uterine fibroids. The study is designed to demonstrate the benefit and safety of relugolix co- administered with low -dose estradiol (1 mg) and norethindrone acetate (0.5 mg ) for 24 weeks. An additional relugolix arm dosed with 12 weeks of relugolix monotherapy 40 mg once daily followed by 12 weeks of relugolix 40 mg once daily co -administered with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate will be used to provide an assessment of the requirement for the low-dose hormonal add -back therapy to mitigate the adverse effect s of relugolix monotherapy on bone mineral density loss and vasomotor symptoms. An extension study is planned to provide additional safety and efficacy data th rough 48 weeks. Women with uterine fibroids and heavy menstrual blood loss by the alkaline hematin method of ≥ 80 mL /cycl e for two cycles or ≥ 160 mL in one cycle during screening will be enrolled in this study. Randomization will be 1:1:1 . Placebo was selected as the appropriate control for the study because there is no standard of care medical therapy for the long -term treatment of women with uterine fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding. Commo nly-used treatment options range from combined oral contraceptive pills , which are not effective in many cases, levonorgestrel - containing intrauterine devices, and leupr olide therapy indicated for 3 months in the preoperative setting. The dose of relugolix for phase 3 evaluation is 40 mg once daily . This dose was selected for evaluation in phase 2 clinical studies based upon phase 1 data demonstrat ing similar estradiol and progesterone suppression in women treated wi th single doses of relugolix 40 mg or 80 mg , and data demonstrating that premenopausal women treated with multiple doses of 40 mg once daily relugolix over 14 days had estradiol levels suppressed to a median value of 3.68 pg/mL. Data from a phase 2 study in women with endometr iosis demo nstrated relugolix 40 mg once daily (N = 101) suppressed estradiol levels to below 20 pg/mL in the majority of women, and results were similar to those in the group of women treated with leuprolide subcutaneous injection, 3.75 mg . Women in both the relugolix 40 mg and the leuprolide groups had similar reducti ons in pelvic pain, the primary endpoint of the study. Finally, as described above, a phase 2 study of doses of relugolix 10, 20 and 40 mg once daily administered to women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids demonstrated the 40 mg dose provided the most reduction in menstrual blood loss and was the optimal dose to move forward into phase 3 develo pment based on efficacy data. However, data on bone mineral density from DXA scanning in both phase 2 studies of premenopausal women with endometriosis or uterine fibroids demonstrated relugolix 40 mg once daily resulted in a degree of bone mineral density loss that is only acceptable for short- term dosing. To mitigate this known adverse consequence of estrogen suppression, relugolix wil l be co-administered with 1 mg estradiol and 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate in this phase 3 clinical study. This low-dose hormonal therapy is currently approved for long-term use to prevent bone mineral density loss and vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women. Although relugolix doses of 20 mg and 10 mg once daily had less bone mineral density loss, these doses did not Myovant Sciences GmbH 40 CONFIDENTIAL MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1.

The co -administration of hormonal add-back therapy to relugolix aims to restore estr adiol con centrations to a range that alleviates the adverse impact of the hypoestrogenic state on bone mineral density through 48 weeks of treatment, as well as on vasomotor symptoms such as hot flushes, but without substantial effect on the beneficial decrease in heavy menstrual bl ood loss. It is well known that bone is exquisitel y sensitive to estrogen and low-doses of estrogen are sufficient to prevent bone mineral density loss in a hypoestrogenic state [Barbieri , 1992]. The combinati on of estradiol with a progestin is commonly used for long-term hormonal add-back therapy to reduce the risk of developing endometrial hyperplasia which can occur with unopposed estrogen therapy [ Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013]. A variety of add- back hormonal therapies have been evaluated in combination with GnRH agonists and antagonists over the last 20 years [Archer , 2015; Chwalisz , 2012; Franke , 2000; Hornstein, 1998; Morris , 2008; Simpson, 1992; Wu, 2014; Zupi , 2004], and a combination of estradiol and norethindrone acetate has been used as add- back therapy in prior clinical studies with leuprolide (a GnRH agonist) and more recently, the GnRH antagonist elagolix, in each case reduc ing bone mineral density loss and the incidence of hot flushes without a significant impact on the decrease in menstrual blood loss [ Archer , 2015; Lee, 2016; Franke , 2000]. The estr adiol/norethindrone acetate combination proposed for evaluation in this phase 3 study is currently approved in the US as long-term hormone replacement therapy to prevent bone loss and alleviate vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women [ Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013]. A 6-week study in healthy premenopausal women adminis tered oral relugolix 40 mg once daily alone or relugolix 40 mg once daily in combination with 1 mg estradiol and 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate has demonstrated that this dose of add- back therapy maintains serum estradiol in the 2 5-50 pg/mL range, the range historically shown to reduce loss of bone mineral density [ Barbieri , 1992]. Serum N- and C- telopept ide concentrations were also maintained at near baseline levels with the addition of the add-back therapy, suggesting reduced bone resorption compared to the group receiving relugolix alone. Hot flush rate was also considerably reduced w ith the addition of add-back therapy. The estrogenic metabolite of norethindrone acetate, ethinyl estradiol, was below the limit of quantitation in almost all PK samples collected , and therefore, will not be assessed in this phase 3 study. Th ese data als o confirm that lower doses of estradiol/norethindrone acetate (such as the 0.5 mg /0.1 mg combination tablet [ Activella US Pres cribing Information, 2013]) would not provide sufficient serum estradiol concentrations to protect against the loss of bone mineral density resulting from the hypoestrogenic state induced by once daily administration of relugolix 40 mg . The doses of estradiol and norethindrone acetate used in this study (1.0 mg and 0.5 mg , resp ectively) represent less than one fifth the estrogenic effects of an oral contraceptive pill containing 30 µg of ethinyl estradiol. Therefore, this low-dose hormonal add- back therapy is added solely to improve the safety of relugolix therapy and is not included as a control arm as it is expected to have either a neutral or a marginal detrimental effect on efficacy, while mitigating the side effects of relugolix on bone mineral density loss and vasomotor symptoms. In summary, relugolix at a dose of 40 mg once daily resulted in a marked decrease in the heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in a majority of women in a well-designed Myovant Sciences GmbH 41 CONFIDENTIAL MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1.

H owever, its administration was associated with a degree of bone mineral density loss unacceptable for long- term treatment. This phase 3 study will primarily assess the efficacy and safety of relugolix 4 0 mg co-administered with a low -dose of estradiol and norethindrone acetate c ompared with placebo at 24 weeks to decrease heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and to prevent the bone mineral density loss and ameliorate some of the other side effects of a hypoestrogenic state such as hot flushes. An additional arm with monotherapy relugolix administer ed for 12 weeks followed by 12 weeks of relugolix co - administered with low-dose hormonal add -back therapy is included to provide data on the requirement for hormonal therapy to mitigate the adverse relugolix side effects of bone mineral density loss and hot flushes.

Patients removed from therapy for any reason will undergo the assessments for the Early Termination visit (Week 24 visit) on the Schedule of Activities and will have a Follow-up visit to assess safety approximately 30 days after the end of study drug treatment (ie, after the patient’s last dose of study medication). The following safety and/or compliance events will result in the removal of patients from therapy either pe rmanently or until the etiology of the problem has been identified and resolved: • Any adverse event that is intolerable to the patient and that cannot be ameliorated by the use of ade quate medical intervention, or that in the opinion of the investigator or m edical monitor would lead to undue risk to the patient if dosing continued; • If it is discovered after randomization that a patient failed to meet protocol entry criteria and conti nued participation poses an unacceptable risk to the patient’s health; • If the following liver test abnormalities develop, st udy drug should be discontinued immediately with appropriate clinical follow -up (including repeat laboratory tests, until a patient’s laboratory profile has returned to normal/baseline status): o ALT or AST > 8 x ULN; or o ALT o r AST > 5 x ULN and persists for more than 2 weeks; or o ALT o r AST > 3 x U LN in conjunction with elevated total bilirubin > 2 x ULN or international normalized ratio (INR) > 1.5; or o ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pa in or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophili a (> 5%) ; • Corrected QTc F prolonga tion of more than 500 msec as read by a cardiologist; • Patients who have a clinically significant decrease in visual acuity as evaluated by an ophthalmol ogist; • Patients who are, in the opinion of the investigator or the m edical moni tor, grossly non- compliant with the protocol’s requirements. This may include < 75% compliance with the study drug for at least 2 months; not returning any feminine products despite having menstrual bleeding for > 2 consecutive cycles; missing multiple study visits; and persistent (> 2 consecutive months) with < 50% of the required number of days of eDiary completion ; • Patients whose treatment assignment has been unblinded by th e investigative site will be permanently discontinued from treatment ; • If the patient becomes pregnant at any time after providing a signed informed consent form, the patient must be withdrawn immediately (see Section 7.8 for information on pregnancy reporting). Should a patient fail to attend the clinic for a required study visit within the protocol-defined window, the site should attempt to contact the patien t and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible. The sit e should also counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and determine whether the patien t can and/or should continue in the study based on previous non-compliance. In cases where the patien t does not return fo r the rescheduled visit or cannot be reached to reschedule the missed visit, the site should make every effort to regain Myovant Sciences GmbH 48 CONFIDENTIAL MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1.

Contrace ption/Pregnancy Avoidance In this study, medications and devices containing hormones for contraception ar e exclude d, and patien ts must agree to use non-hormonal contraception throughout the study , including through 30 days following the last dose of study drug, unless any of the following apply: • Has a sexual partner(s) who was vase ctomized at least 6 months p rior to the Screening visit; • Had a bilateral tubal occlusion (including ligation and blockage methods such as Essure ), at le ast 4 months prior to the first Screening visit (patients with Essure must have prior confirmation of tubal occlusion by hysterosalpingogram) and there must be no evidence of post-Essure syndrome; • Is not sexually active with men; periodic sexual relationship(s) with men requires the use of non-hormona l contraception as noted below; • Practices total abstinence from sexual inte rcours e, as her preferred lifestyle ; periodic abstinence is not acceptable. The only acceptable methods of contraception for those for whom one of the above methods do not apply are: • Condom (male or female condom) with or without spermicide (cream, spray, foam, gel, suppositor y or polymer film); • Diaphragm with spermicide (condom may or may not be used); • Cervi cal cap with spermicide (condom may or may not be used); or • Vagi nal sponge impregnated with spermicide used with a condom. Patien ts will be provided with information on acceptable methods of contraception as part of the informe d consent process and will confirm when they sign a consent form they understand the requirements for avoidance of pregnancy during the course of the study. Patients may not donat e ova during the course of the study and for 2 months following the last dose of study drug. A patient may start hormonal contraception 4 weeks after her last study dose of study drug provided her menstrual cycle has returned. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at monthly intervals during the study (including just prior to receiving first dose of study drug ), and patien ts will receive continued guidance with respect to the avoidance of pregnancy as part of the study procedur es. Patien ts who become pregnant during the study will be withdrawn from the study and followed for pregnancy outcome (see Section 7.8).

If dosing is missed in the morning for any reason, the study treatment may be taken later in the day, under fasting conditions, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating a meal. The study treatment should be taken a s close as possible to the same time of morning each day. On selected clinic da ys, study drug will be administered in the clinic (refer to Sections 1.1 and Section 6.3) or the visits during which patients take study drug in the clinic rather than at home) Patients will hold their study treatment on clinic visit days and recor d the time of their previous dose (ie, the time that they took their dose on the day before the clinic visit); they will be instructed to take their study treatment in the clinic after PK and pharmacodynamic samples are collected . 5.5. Dose Redu ction/Dose Administration No toxicity -related dose reductions of study drug are p ermitted . Patients who experience a grade 3 or greater toxicity that cannot be ameliorated by the use of adequate medical intervention should have their treatment interrupted until the toxicity improves to a g rade 2 or lower severity. Patients may subsequently be re-started on study drug with the written approval of the sponsor (or designee ). 5.6. Storage, P ackaging, and Labeling Study drug should be stored in an appropriate, limited- access, s ecure location within a temperature range of 20°C to 25°C with excursion to 15°C to 30°C permitted until it is used or returned to the sponsor (or designee). Study drug should be stored protected from light. A daily temperature log of the drug storage area must be maintained every working day. Study drug must be stored under the conditions specified on the label, and remain in the original container until dispensed. Only patients enrolled in the study may receive study drug , and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study drug. Further guidance and information for final disposition of unused study drug are provided in the S tudy Reference Manual. The investigator is responsible for study drug accountability, reconciliati on, and record maintenance, including receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records and their secur e storage. Study drug will be labeled with the study protocol number, medication or kit number, contents, directi ons for use, storage directions, clinical study statement, and any other labeling required by regulatory bodies in the study locations and will list Myovant Sciences GmbH as the sponsor.

Blinding All patients, investigators, and sponsor staff or representatives involved in the conduct of the study w ill be blinded to treatment assignment, with the exception of an unblinded statistician(s) who is responsible for developing the randomization codes and presenting unblinded data to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board if requested . The blind will be maintained during assessment of PK and pharmacodynamic testing; PK concentrations will be reported to the sponsor in a blinded fashion, or only after database lock and unblinding, or provisions will be m ade to provide data only to personnel approved for unblinding. Unblinding by the i nvestiga tor for a given patient will occur only if the knowledge of treatment assignment will materially change the planned management of a medical emergency. The decision to unblind a patient’s treatment assignment in an emergency situation resides with the investigator who has direct access to unblind a patient’s individual study treatment; however, the investigator should attempt to contact the medical monitor or appropriate study personnel to discuss options before unblinding the patient’s treatment assignment unless the urgency of the medical situation precludes this. If unblinding by the investigator occurs before sponsor personnel can be consulted or notified, the Inv estigator must notify the sponsor as soon as possible after unblinding, but without revealing the treatment assignment of the unblinded patient . Patients whose treatment assignment has been unblinded by the investigative site will be permanently discontinued from treatment. 5.8. Study Drug Accountability and Treatment Compliance Patients should complete their eDiary each day on study, and should bring all unused and used study dru g to each study visit. At the week 12 visit all unused and used study drug should be retained at the site and new study drug dispensed. Study drug accountability will be conducted and results will be recorded. If a patien t is persistently noncompliant with the study treatment it may be ap propriate to withdraw the patient from the stu dy (see Section 4.6) . All patien ts shoul d be reinstructed about the dosing requirement during study contacts. The authorized study personnel conducting the re -education must document the process in the patient’s source records. 5.9. Treatm ent after the End of Study Patien ts who complete 24 weeks of treatment on this study and wish to continue therapy may be eligible to continue treatment in the extension s tudy MVT -601- 3003.

The Screening 4 visit should be skipped if the menstrual blood loss is > 160 mL in the first screening cycle. 6.2.1. Screening 1 Visit The Screening 1 visit will be conducted following the signing of the informed consent form and may occu r at any time during the menstrual cycle . The Screening 1 visit will include a full medical history (including menstrual history for 3 months prior to Screening and prior uterine imaging assessments) , review of inclusion and exclusion criteria, collection of concomitant medications , study procedure- related adverse event s and any serious adverse event s. In addition, vital signs, height, weight, temperature, a complete physical examination , visual acuity assessment , gynecology examination, u ltrasound, endometrial biopsy, P apanicolaou test (if needed), clinical laboratory tests, urinalysis , and a urine pregnancy test will be done. Feminine products will be dispensed with instructions to collect and return all products used during the next menses. The paper diary will also be dispensed at this visit and should be completed daily starting with this visit. The bone mineral density scan and mammogram should be scheduled at this time (or within a few days of this visit) . Bone densitometry should be scheduled to be prior to the Screening 3 visit and as early as feasible to ensure results are available prior to randomization. The order of procedures should be as follows. Patients not meeting eligibility criteria after any procedure s hould not undergo subsequent procedures. • Medical history and review of prior uterine imaging studies • Revie w of concomitant medications (including supplements and over the counter medicatio ns) • Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria • Urin e pregnancy test • Vita l signs, weight, and height • Comp lete physical examination and visual acuity assessment • Ultr asound – do not proceed with additional procedures if no uterine fibroids are identifie d with the local/initial reading • Gynecology examination, Papanicolaou test (if need), endometrial biopsy , clinical lab oratory tests, including TSH, urinalysis • Dispense feminine products and paper diary with instructions to begin recording starting informa tion daily, starting on the Screening 1 visit day • Schedule mammogram (if needed) • Schedul e bone densitometry The ultr asound will be a transvaginal ultrasound with or without a transabdominal ultrasound (see Secti on 4.3 ultrasound entry criteria), performed to assess for uterine fibroids. Saline or gel contras t may be used but is not required (see Section 4.3 ultrasound entry criteria). The anatomic location and size of the fibroid disease will be estimated by the local reader . The ultrasound images will be submitted to the central reader for confirmation that the patient meets the inclusion criteria for a diagnosis of uterine fibroids (this confirmation must be received prior to Myovant Sciences GmbH 58 CONFIDENTIAL MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1.

The invest igator, rather than the central reader, will determine if any exclusionary pathology is present. If ultrasound fails to demonstrate fibroids on the local reading , do not proceed with additional Screening visit 1 procedures. The P apanicolaou test must be conducted for women without a test result within 2 years prior to t he Screening 1 visit and the specimen is to be submitted to the cen tral laboratory. A repeat test should be performed for inadequate or false- positive results and submitted to the central laboratory. The endometrial biopsy will be obtained with an endo metrial suction curette (eg, Pipelle ) and submitted to the Central Laboratory. The mammogram must be done in patients ≥ 39 years of age by the time of the (anticipated) Baseline Day 1 visit if there is no record (and reading) from within 6 months prior to the screening period. If the hemoglobin is < 10 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume is below the lower limit of normal, a ferritin and iron level will be reported through the central lab. Please see Section 5.10.2.2 for guidance on iron therapy. 6.2.2. Screening 2 Visit Screening 2 visit is scheduled to occur within 5 (+2) days after cessat ion of the patient’s first menses following the Screening 1 visit. Patien ts will return at Screeni ng 2 visit to return their feminine products. At this visit, clinical laboratory tests will be drawn, including a venous blood sample for use in the quantitation of menstrual blood loss. Additional feminine products will be dispensed for collection of menstrual blood loss during the next menses. If the hemoglobin is < 10 g/dL and mean corpuscular volume is below the lower limit of normal, a ferritin and iron level will be reported through the central lab. Women whose laboratory testing reveals iron- deficiency anemia as defined in the study must be started on iron therapy. Confirm the scheduling of the bone densitometry and mammogram (if needed) and review mammogram results, if available. The mammogram must be normal (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category 1 or 2 or equivalent) in order for the patient to be eligible. Once the menstrual blood loss results from the first cycle are available, schedule Screening 3 visit as soon as feasible and within 5 (+2) days of receiving results showing that the menstrual blood loss is ≥ 80 mL Patients will be dispensed feminine products to be gathered for the second cycle. 6.2.3. Screening 3 Visit The patient will retur n for the Screening 3 visit if her menstrual blood loss from cycle 1 is ≥ 80 mL and within ≤ 15 days after the Screening 2 visit . At the Screening 3 visit, review of inclusion and exclusion criteria will be conducted to confirm continued eligibility. Concomitant medication and adverse events will be assessed and vital signs taken. A signs and symptoms directed physical exam ination, a 12-lead ECG and a urine pregnancy test will be performed. At this visit, r eview the endometrial biopsy r esults and review mammogram results, if available. Myovant Sciences GmbH 59 CONFIDENTIAL MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1.

Screening 4 Visit The Screening 4 visit should be skipped if the menstrual blood loss is > 160 mL in the first screening cycle. If not skipped, then t he Screening 4 visit is scheduled to occur within 5 (+2) days after cessation of the patient’s menses following Screening 3 visit. At the Screening 4 visit, the patient’s feminine products will be collected to submit for the quantitation of menstrual blood loss, and a blood sample will be drawn for hemoglobin assessment. The patient’s eDiary data collection will be reviewed. Laboratory and imaging evaluations will be review ed to ensure eligibility for randomization . 6.2.5. Menstrual Blood Loss Repeat Collection At the discretion of the investigator, the collect ion of menstrual blood loss can be repeated once during the screening period (either after the first or second screening cycle) if one menstrual cycle does not meet the heavy mens trual bleeding alkalin e hematin criteria and it is thought to be due to an inadequate collection by a highly motivated patient. 6.2.6. Re-Screening P atients who fail screening may be re -scree ned with approval of the medical monitor. Patients undergoing re- screening will sign a new informed consent form and issued a new screening number. For p atients who begin re -screen ing within 10 weeks of signing the original informed consent form, transvaginal ultraso und, endometrial biopsy, and bone densitometry do not need to be repeated, if performed previously. 6.2.7. Retestin g Screening laboratory tests may be repeated once during the S creening period, if necessary, at the investigator’s discretion. For laboratory- based entry criteria, the most recent value will be used to determine eligibility. Additional laboratory retesting requires the approval of the medical monitor. Retesting of other procedur es (except once, as required, due to technical or logistical issues such as an inadequate sample) also require approval of the medical monitor. 6.3. Randomiz ed Treatment Period (Baseline to Week 24) At the Baseline Day 1 v isit, pati ents will be randomized to one of the three study treatment arms (see Section 5.3). Patien ts will take their randomized study treatment once daily, beginning on the day of the Baseline Day 1 v isit and continuing through the Week 24 visit. Patients will continue reco rding daily in their eDiary . On -treatment study visits will occur every 4 weeks through the end of Week 24. At each post- baseline visit, patients will return their feminine products for alkaline hematin testing. Safety monitoring including signs and symptoms directed physical examination, waist circumference, ECGs, clinical laboratory tests, pregnancy tests, and adverse event collection will occur at each visi t. Bone densitometry will occur at the Week 12 Myovant Sciences GmbH 60 CONFIDENTIAL MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 86"

A repeat trans vaginal ultrasound (with or without a transabdominal ultrasound) and endometrial biopsy will be performed at the Week 24 visit. The endometrial biopsy will be read centrall y. Study drug and eDi ary compliance will be reviewed at each visit . Refer to the Schedule of Activities in the synopsis (see Section 1.1) for information about st udy proce dures during the randomized treatment period. Sites should try t o schedul e patien t visits during the morning, instructing patients to arrive before taking their study drug to allow for pre -dose PK /pharmacodynamic sampling on visits at which these specimens are drawn . Patients must come to the clinic in the fasted state (eg, nothing to eat or drink other than water after midnight the day before the clinic visit) for the Baseline Day 1 and Week 24/Early Termination visits. For visits other than Baseline Day 1 and Week 24/Early Termination, if the clinic visit cannot be scheduled f or the morning, patients may eat in the morning but should not have eaten or had anything to drink other than water , coffee, or tea for at least 2 hours prior to the clinic visit and must not eat or drink (other than water , coffee or tea) for at least 1 hour after the clinic visit. In these situations, the laboratory requisitions must indicate that the patient was not fasted for their chemistry and lipid testing. 6.4. Continuat ion into Extension Study It is expected that most patients will ente r the 2 8-week extension s tudy (MVT -601-3003), which will be conducted under a separate protocol. Patien ts will provide separate informed consent to participate in the extension s tudy during which all patients will receive relugolix 40 mg co- administered with 1.0 mg estradiol / 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate. 6.5. Early Ter mination Visit and Follow- up Visit All patients withdrawing from the study prior to Week 24 will complete an Early T ermination visit. The Early Termination visit procedures are identical to those of Week 24; however, for patients whose last dose of study drug is during Week 6 or earlier, the following procedures do not need to be performed: transvaginal ultrasound (with or without a transabdominal ultrasound), endometrial biopsy, and bone densitometry. These procedures may be performed, however, at the investigator’s discretion, if they aid in follow-up of ongoing adverse events. All patien ts who do not wish to or who are not eligible to enroll in the extension s tudy (MV T-601-3003), will have a Follow-up visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug, or prior to the date of initiation of another investigational agent or hormonal thera py affecting the hypothalamic -pituitary -gonadal axis or surgical intervention for uterine fibroids, whichever occurs first . This visit will be used to assess safety after discontinuation of study treatment including adverse events, clinical safety laboratories, 12-lead ECG, and return of menstruation . Patients who withdraw early from this study will also undergo the Follow-up visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug, or the date of initiation of another investigational agent or hormonal therapy affecting the hypothalamic- pituitary -gonadal axis or surgical intervention for uterine fibroids , whichever occurs first . Refer to the Schedule of Activities at the end of the synopsis (see Secti on 1.1 ) for individual study visit procedures during the Follow-up visit.

Additional Safety Follow -Up Procedures For patients not continuing into the extension study (MVT-601-3003) , addit ional safety procedures are required in some circumstances as described below. These procedures will be performed during unscheduled visits. • Patients whose menses has not resumed as of the Follow- Up visit for whom th ere is no explanation for the lack of resumption (eg, medical procedure or medications) will be contacted by telephone 3 (+0.5) months after the Follow- Up visit to determine if menses has resumed and questioned about factors that may affect resumption of m enses. • Patients with endometrial biopsy findings of endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer on the endometrial biopsy at the Week 24/Early Termination visit will undergo a repeat biopsy in 3 to 6 months after the Week 24/Early Termination and will be contacted to obtain information on procedures performed or treatments received (if any) for the biopsy findings through the time of the repeat biopsy. The repeat biopsy will be submitted to the central laboratory. In addition, patients with endometrial hyperplasia with atypia will be evaluated and managed, as needed, by a gynecologist. • Patients who have had a bone mineral density loss of > 2% at the lumbar spine (L1- L4) or total hip at their Week 24/Early Termination visit relative to baseline will undergo a follow-up DXA scan 6 months (± 1 month) after discontinuation of study drug and will be contacted to obtain information about medications and conditions (eg, pregnancy, hyperparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, etc) that might affect bone mineral density through the time of the repeat DXA scan. The follow-up DXA scan will be submitted for central reading. 6.7. Unschedule d Visits Unscheduled visits may be performed at any time during the study whenever necessary to assess for or follo w-up on adverse events, at the patient’s request, or as deemed necessary by the investigator. The date and reason for the Unscheduled visit should be recorded in the source documentation. The following activities should be completed at Unscheduled visits: recording of reason for the visit, concomitant medication review and evaluat ion of adverse events . In addition, procedures such as vital signs, we ight, symptom- directed brief physical examination, central safety laboratory assessment , urine pregnancy testing, PK and pharmacodynamic sampl ing, 12-lead ECG, study drug compliance and dispensation, etc. may be conducted as needed . See Schedule of Events ( Section 1.1) for tests that may b e performed if indicated at an unscheduled visit. Consult with the medical monitor, if needed, to discuss Unscheduled visit testing.

Menstrual Blood Loss as Assessed by the Alkaline Hematin Method The volume of menstrual blood loss is measured in milliliters using the alkaline hematin method [Hallberg , 1964]. The method involves pummeling used feminine products in a solution and measurin g the resulting hematin absorbance against calibration curves. The method is validated in accordance with current FDA Guidance for Method Validations and is an accepted quantitative clinical endpoint for the assessment of heavy menstrual bleeding. The si te staff will provide collection kits with standardized and validated feminin e products to patients for the collection and assessment of those products to determine menstrual blood loss. The feminine products will be dispensed and collected at each visit until the patient completes treatment or terminates participation from the study prior to completing treatment. Each time the patient submits her feminine products from a menstrual cycle for analysis, a venous blood sample will be collected and sent to the laboratory. Details regarding materials, process, and requirements for the menstrual blood loss collection will be provided in the S tudy Reference Manual . 6.8.1.2. Transvaginal and Transabdominal Ultrasound Transvaginal with or without transabdominal ultrasound with or without saline or gel contrast is performed for the diagnosis of uterine fibroids, to determine uterine and myoma volumes, and to exclude any other uterine or pelvic pathology. To avoid inter-observer and inter- device variations, a single operator will be assigned to a patien t and will perform each of the ultrasound scans using the s ame device as far as possible. Transvaginal ultrasound will be performed. Once the transvaginal ultrasound is done, a transabdominal ultrasound may also be done if the uterus cannot be adequately imaged on transvaginal ultrasound; for exam ple, due to enlarged size. On the assumption that the ut erus and myoma are spheroids, uterine and myoma volumes are calculated using the formula: Uterine or myoma volume = D1 x D2 x D3 x π / 6 Where: D1 = the longest diameter of the myoma or uterus (unit of length: cm) D2 = the l ongest diameter of the myoma or uterus that is perpendicular to D1 (unit of length: cm) D3 = the diameter of the myoma or uterus that crosses the intersection of D1 and D2 (inter section “Z”) and is perpendicular to the D1/D2 plane (unit of length: cm). The D1, D2, and D3 locally -determined values for the uterus and myoma will be recorded centrally. The images will be submitted for central review to confirm myoma presence and size. At the Screening 1 visit, the longest diameter (D1) of the largest myoma will be noted and recorded. Only the largest myoma among those measurable at the Screening 1 visit will be measured throughout the study. Myovant Sciences GmbH 63 CONFIDENTIAL MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1.

If transabdominal ultrasound or ultrasound with saline or gel contrast is performed at Screening, it should also be performed at Week 24. 6.8.1.3. Pharmacodynamics Sample Collect ion Blood samples for the pharmacodynamic analysis of serum LH, FSH, estradiol, and progesterone will be collected pre -dose at the visits indicated in the study Schedule of Activities in the protocol synopsis ( see Section 1.1). Th ese pharmacodynamic sample s wil l be analyzed at a central laboratory. For PK analysis of estradiol, a separate PK sample will be obtained to be analyzed at a PK laboratory (see Section 6.8.1.4) . To maintain blinding, concentrations of these hormones will be reported to the investigator, other vendors, and sponsor personnel only after database lock and unblinding. 6.8.1.4. Pharmacokinetics Sample Collection Blood samples for PK analysis of relugolix, estradiol, and norethindrone will be c ollected pre- dose at the visits indicated in the study Schedule of Activities in the protocol synopsis (see Section 1.1). The actual date and time of each blood sample collection will be recorded. Patients will be instructed to hold their dose of study drug on clinic visit days and record the time of their previous dose (ie, the time they took their dose on the day before the clinic visit). If the study patient inadvertently took drug at home on the morning of the clinic visit, the dosing history should be accurately recorded and a PK sample collected (which may be used for population PK modeling). To maintain blinding, PK concentrations will be reported to the sponsor in a blinded fashion, or only af ter database lock a nd unblinding. Collection , processing, storage, and shipping procedures are provided in the Study Reference Manual. Plasma and serum analysis will be performed by the sponsor (or designee). Plasma concentrations of relugolix and norethindrone and serum co ncentrations of estradiol will be determined in samples using a validated bioanalytical methodology. Raw data will be archived at the bioanalytical site. Once a sample has been analyzed for relugolix, estradiol , or norethindrone , any remaining plasma may be analyzed for other compound- related metabolites and the results reported under a separate protocol. 6.8.1.5. Patient Diar y All women enrolled in the study will be provided with a device with an application for a patient eDiary, along with detailed instruction s for its use . Patients will complete daily eDiaries including compliance with study treatment, menstrual bleeding, use of feminine products, uterine fibroid -associated pain , and use of pain medication (analgesics ) to treat uterine fibroid pain (see Appendix 2 ).

Patients will also receive a paper diary to enter information on menstruation status and feminine product use s tarting with Screening 1 visit and ending when they receive their eD iary at the Screening 3 visit. 6.8.1.6. Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire The Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire (MIQ) was designed t o measure a women’s self - assessment of menstrual blood loss and its impact on her social and leisure activities, physical activities , and ability to work (see Appendix 3) . The MIQ has undergone psychometric validatio n. Patients will complete the MIQ at each study visit during the randomized treatment period. With exception of Baseline Day 1 (see Section 1.1), patients will complete the MIQ at each visit at the site before other study procedures. 6.8.1.7. Uterine Fibroid Symptom – Quality of Life The Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health- Related Quality of Life (UFS -QOL ) score is used to evaluate the symptom severity and the quality of life of patients w ith uterine fibroids (see Appendix 4). Patients will complete the UFS -QOL questionnaire at the site at the Baseline Day 1 visit, Week 12 visit, a nd Week 24 visit. With the exception of Baseline Day 1 (see Section 1.1), patients will complete the UFS -QOL before other study procedures . 6.8.1.8. European Quality of Life Five -Dimension Five-Level Scale The European Quality of Life Five- Dimension Five -Level Scale (EQ -5D- 5L) is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcomes (see Appendix 5) . Mobility, self- care, u sual activities, p ain/discomfort, and anxiety/de pression are each assessed on 5-point categorical scales ranging from “no problem” to “severe problem.” Patients will complete the EQ -5D- 5L questi onnaire at the site at the Baseline Day 1 visit and the Week 24 visit. With the exception of Baseline Day 1 (see Section 1.1 ), patients will complete EQ-5D- 5L before other study procedures. 6.8.1.9. Patient Global Assessment for Symptoms and Patient Global Assessment for Function These simple questions are used by the patient to qualitatively describe severity of symptoms or effects on function (PGA) (see Appendix 6) on a schedule described in the Schedule of Activities (see Secti on 1.1). With the exception of Baseline Day 1 (see Section 1.1 ), patients will answer these questions before other types of study procedures. The PGA for function and PGA for symptoms will be completed on a paper questionnaire at the study site on a schedule described in the Schedule of Activities ( see Section 1.1). With the exception of Baseline Day 1, patients will answer these questions before other types of study procedures. The PGA for function and PGA for symptoms will be completed on a paper questionnaire at the study site. Myovant Sciences GmbH 65 CONFIDENTIAL MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1.

Patients whose menses has not resumed as of the Follow-Up visit for whom there is no explanat ion for the lack of resumption (eg, medical procedure or medications) will be contacted by telephone 3 (+0.5) months after the Follow-Up visit to determine if menses has resumed and questioned about fa ctors that may affect resumption of menses. 6.8.1.11. Pharmacogenomics Sample Collection For possible exploratory investigation of markers enabling the prediction of drug response, one sample of blood will be collected and stored for future pharmacogenomic analys es, unless precluded by local law or regulations . All patien ts will be eligible for collection of the pharmacogenomic sample, however, the sample may only be obtained and stored from patien ts who provide a separate informed consent form for pharmacogenomic sample collection. Patien t participation in the pharmacogenomic research is voluntary and refusal to participate will not preclude entry into the study or indicate withdrawal from the study. If possible, the pharmacogenomic sample should be drawn from consented patien ts a t the Baseline Day 1 v isit, but it may be drawn at any time during the study through Week 24 (inclusive). Patients can request their sample to be destroyed at any time.

If the biopsy is inadequate for diagnosis at either Screening or at Week 24, it should be repeated and sample submitt ed to the central laboratory. If the second specimen is also inadequate for diagnosis at Screening, the patient is not eligible for the study. Bone Mineral Density 6.8.2.7. Bone Mineral Density Bone mineral density is determined using DXA scanning and will be assessed at the lumbar spine (L1, L2, L3 and L4), total hip, and femoral neck (same leg within each patien t). The scans will be read by the central radiology laboratory in accordance with the imaging charter . Training, quality review, and readings will be done by a central radiology laboratory as described in the central radiology charter for bone mineral density. Throughout the study, the same DXA apparatus will used at each site and operated in the same scan mode f or all scans for an individual patien t. A central core imaging laborator y will collect and evaluate all DXA scans for acceptability, and will have bone mineral density assessed as per the imaging charter. Data from the DXA scan s will be managed and analyzed separately by the core laboratory and integrated into the study’s database at the end of the study. Bone mineral density changes for individual patient will be monitored by a central radiology laboratory over the course of the study. Investigators will be notified if a patient experiences a bone mineral density loss from baseline of 7% or more at any of the anatomical sites assessed during the study. In this cas e, it is at the investigator’s discretion to consider the patient’s status and determine future management. Detailed instructions for DXA scanning will be provided in the Study Reference Manual. Please see Section 6.6 for follow -up of patients who are not continuing into the extension study (MVT -601-3003) and whose bone mineral density has decreased by > 2% at the lumbar spine (L1-L4) or total hip at the Week 24/Early Termination visit relative to Baseline.

If the patient uses corrective lenses, she should wear her usual prescription glasses or contact lenses during the assessment, and the same prescription lenses should be worn at subsequent visual testing, as possible. Perform the visual acuity testing using the entire eye chart. Do not stop at a visual acuity of 100 – continue as far as the patient can go per the testing instructions (see Study Reference Manual for additional details). Patients whose presenting visual acuity score is 90 or lower at the Baseline visit should be encouraged to obtain a diagnostic evaluation from an eye care provider, ie, an ophthalmologist or an optometrist. Any findings (ie, diagnoses) from the eye examination should be recorded as medical history. Patients whose presenting visual acuity score at Week 24 /Early termination has de creased by 10 or more points from Baseline should be referred to an ophthalmologist for a diagnostic evaluation. A copy of the ophthalmology consultation must be submitted to the sponsor. 6.8.3. Biological Sample Retention and Destruction Biological samples present a t the conclusion of this study may be retained in storage by the sponsor for a period up to 10 years for purposes of this study. Samples of blood collected for pharmacogenomics testing (see Section 6.8.1.11) will be stored frozen a t an appropriate vendor facility identified by the sponsor. The need to conduct pharmacogenomic analysis may be identified after this study (or additional studies) has been completed. For this reason, the collected samples will be retained for up to 10 years after the last patien t completes the study. A patien t may request the destruction of her sample at any time. The sponsor may destroy the samples sooner than 10 years after the study comp letes. 7. SAFETY CO NSIDERATIONS Study assessments of safety include adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs (and weig ht), ECGs, bone mineral density assessments, endometrial biopsy results, and clinical laboratory tests . 7.1. Adverse E vent Definitions 7.1.1. Adverse E vent Adverse event: An advers e event is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal pr oduct, whether or not related to the medicinal product. Events meeting the definition of an adver se event include : • A worsening, excluding minor fluctuations, in the nature, severity, frequency, or duration of a pre -ex isting condition ; Myovant Sciences GmbH 70 CONFIDENTIAL MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 96"
97,page_97,"Clinical Study Protocol: MVT -601-3001 Amendment 2, Effective: 18- SEP-2017 • Development of an intercurrent illness during the study; • Development of symptoms that may or may not be related to the use of a concomitant medica tion or investigational product; • Injury or accidents: If a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or accident, the m edical condition and the accident should be reported as 2 separate medical events (eg, for a fall secondary to dizziness, both “dizziness” and “fall” should be recorded separately) ; and • An investigational abnormality (eg, labor atory parameter, vital sign, ECG) only if the abnormality is considered clinically significant by the investigator based on at least one of the following criteria: o Induces clinical signs or symptoms ; o Requi res active intervention; o Requir es interruption or discontinuation of study drug. Events t hat do not meet the definition of an adverse event include: • Medical or surgical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); the condit ion that leads to the procedure is an adverse event ; • Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected before the start of study drug admini stration that do not worsen; • Situations where an untoward medical event has not occurred (eg, planned hospitaliz ation for an elective procedure, with elective defined as known or planned at the time of signing of the informed consent). • Events of heavy menstrual bleeding, as heavy menstrual bleeding is being quanti tatively measured as an efficacy endpoint, unless the event meets seriousness criteria. Adverse events that occur during the study should be evaluated by the investigator and graded accordin g to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). Episodic adverse events, such as vomiting, or those that occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive days are ‘intermittent’. All other events are ‘continuous’. Additional information on detecting, documenting, and reporting adverse events and serious adverse events are provided below. 7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a. Results in d eath; b. Is life -threate ning; NOTE: The term “life -threa tening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the study participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life -threatening even though drug- induced hepatitis can be fatal . c. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; Myovant Sciences GmbH 71 CONFIDENTIAL MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 97"
98,page_98,"Clinical Study Protocol: MVT -601-3001 Amendment 2, Effective: 18- SEP-2017 NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the patien t has been detained at the hospital or emergency ward f or observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out-patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are adverse event s. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the adverse event should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an adverse event . d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ; NOTE : The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal li fe functions. This definition is not intended to incl ude experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substa ntial disruption . e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; f. Impo rtant medical events which jeopardize the patient and m ay require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant c ancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 7.2. Adverse E vent Reporting The reporting of serious adverse events by the sponsor (Myovant Sciences GmbH) to r egulatory authorities is a requirement and each authority has a timetable for reporting these events based upon established criteria. Likewise, i t is the responsibility of the investigator to report serious adverse events to their local Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC). Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse event s and/or se rious adverse event s. Open- ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the patien t is the preferred method to inquire about adverse event occurrence. Appropriate questions include: • “How are you feeling?” • “Have y ou had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/contact?” • “Have y ou taken any new medicines, other than those provided in this study, since your last visit/contact? The patient ’s eDiary entries and answers to the UFS- QOL will not be used as a primary means to collect adverse event s, however they should be reviewed by the study site personnel and the study monitors. Should the investigator or site staff become aware of a potential adverse event through the information collected with these instruments, proper follow -up with the patien t for medical evaluation should be undertaken. Through this follow- up, if it is determined that an adverse event not previously reported has been identified, normal reporting requirements should be applied.

At the conclusion of the study, the investigator and m edical monitor will assess unresolved adverse events and determine if additional follow-up is warranted . All adverse events, whether or not related to the study drug treatment, must be fully and complete ly documented on the adverse event case report form and in the patient’s source documents. In addition, any adverse event resulting in permanent t reatment discontinuation must be recorded on the appropriate case report form as well as documented in the patient’s source documents. Adverse event terms should include a diagnosis, as available, in preference to listing the individual signs and symptoms. If the diagnosis is not known, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as an individual adverse event. Overdose and pregnancy in the patie nt will be reported as described in Section 7.7 and Section 7.8, respectively. 7.2.1. Advers e E vent Reporting Period Adverse events will be col lected from the time the first dose of study drug is administered until the Follow-up visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug or the date of initiation of another investigational agent or hormonal therapy affecting the hypothalamic - pituitary -gonadal axis or surgical intervention for uterine fibroids , whichever occurs first , as also specified in the study Schedule of Activities ( Section 1.1). Study procedure- related adverse events will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form. Serious adverse events will be c ollected from the signing of the informed consent form until the safety follow -up visit appr oximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Serious adverse events reported to the investigator after the safety reporting period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator assesses the event as related to the study drug treatment. With the exception of adverse events that are considered related to study screening procedures, (which are to be recorded as adverse events), event s occurring between signing of the informed consent form and the first dose of study drug will be recorded as medical history and in the patient’s clinical record for any patient who continues to meet eligibility criteria and proceeds to dosing with study drug. Reporting instructions for serious adverse events are provided in Section 7.6. 7.3. Assigni ng Causal Relationship to Study Drug The reasonable possibility of the relationship of an adverse event to study drug(s) is to be assessed with careful medical con sideration at the time of evaluation of an adverse event. The following definitions are to be used for the relationship of the adverse event to study drug: • Probably related : A c linical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and that follows a clinically reasonable response on readministration (rechallenge) or withdrawal (dechallenge).

100,page_100,"Clinical Study Protocol: MVT -601-3001 Amendment 2, Effective: 18- SEP-2017 • Possibly related : A clinical ev ent, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug but that could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. • Not related : A c linical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to drug administration that makes a causal relationship improbable and/or in which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide a plausible explanation. All adverse events, whether or not related to study drug, must be fully and completely documented on t he adverse event page of the eCRF and in the patient’s clinical record . In the event a patient is withdrawn from the study because of an adverse event, it must b e recorded on the eCRF as such. 7.4. Assigni ng Severity Rating for Adverse Events Severity describes the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarct ion); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medic al significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious ,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action taken . The investigator must determine the severity of each adverse event according to the N ational Cancer Institute CTCAE. For terms not specified with the CTCAE, the criteria in Table 7-1 should be used t o determine the grade severity. Table 7-1 Criteria for Determining the Grade/Severity of Adverse Event Terms Not Specified by the National Cancer Institute CTCAE Grade Criteria 1/Mild Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations o nly; intervention not indicated 2/Moderate Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living 3/Severe or medically significant Not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; dis abling; limiting self -care activities of daily living 4/Life -threatening Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 5/Death Death related to adverse event Adverse event severity should be recorded in the appropriate section of the adverse event case report for m and in the patient’s source documents. 7.5.

Criteria for Temporary Withholding of Study Drug in Association w ith Liver Test Abnormalities Hepatic enzymes will be monitored in accordance with FDA drug-induced liver injury guidelines [FDA , 2009]. If the following liver test abnormalities develop, study drug should be withheld immediately with appropriate clinical follow -up (including repeat laboratory tests, until a patient’s laboratory profile has retur ned to normal/baseline status) , and the event reported as a serious adverse event : • ALT or AST > 8 x ULN; or • ALT o r AST > 5 x UL N and persists for more than 2 weeks; or • ALT or AST > 3 x ULN an d total bilirubin > 2 x ULN or the International Normalized Ratio ( INR) > 1.5; or • ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pa in or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%). Rechallenge may be considered if an alternative cause for the abnormal liver tests (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline values. The investigator and sponsor must discuss and agree wi th any decision to rechallenge. Rechallenge should not occur when the etiology of the liver test abnormalities is considered possibly drug induced. 7.5.2. Criteria for Permanent Discontinuatio n of Study Drug in Assoc iation w ith Liver Test Abnormalities Study drug treatment should be discontinued permanently if all of the following 4 criteria are met (ie, potential severe drug-induc ed liver injury/Hy’s law case): 1. AST or ALT increases to ≥ 3 x ULN; AND 2. Total bilirubin increases to > 2 x ULN or INR > 1.5; AND 3. Alkaline phosphatase value does not reach 2 x ULN ; AND 4.

All serious adverse events will be followed until resolution, until the event has stabilized, and/or reached a new baseline. All serious adverse events continuing at the completion of the study must be assessed or followed to determine outcome. 7.7. Study Drug Overdose Management The medical monitor must be contacted in the event of any study drug overdose. An overdose is defined as a known deli berate or accidental administration of study drug, to or by a study patien t, at a dose above that assigned to that individual patien t according to the study protocol. For this study, any dose of relugolix > 80 mg within a 24- hour window is an overdose and any dose of estradiol/norethindrone acetate > 2 x the protocol dose is an overdose (ie, more than 2 capsules taken within a 24-hour window). There is no known antidote for an overdose. In the event of an overdose, the investigator or treating physician should: • Con tact the medical mon itor immediatel y; • Closely monitor the patien t for adv erse events and laboratory abnormalities ; • All overdose events are to be reported within 24 hours of awareness by the study site, using a s erious adverse event form according to Section 7.6, whether or not the overdose is associ ated with an adverse event ; • If possible, obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis within 2 days from the date of the last dose of study drug if requested by the medical monitor (determined on a case- by-case basis) ; • Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the eCRF. The med ical monitor, in consul tation w ith the investigator, will make decisions regarding patien t status and potential dose interruptions, based on the clinical evaluation of the patien t. 7.8. Pregnan cy Reporting If any patient becomes pregnant during the study, the site must discontinue the patien t from the study treatment immediately and have her return for an Early Termination visit. The investigator must inform the patient of her right to receive treatment information. If the patient chooses to receive unblinded treatment information, the individual blind should be broken and the treatment assignment provided to the patient. The study team will remain blinded to the patient’s treatment assignment. If the patient agrees , the i nvestigator should notify the patient’s primary care physician of the pregnancy and provide details of the patient’s participation in the study and treatment (blinded or unblinded, as applicable). A pregnancy is to be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness by the study site personnel, us ing the Pregnancy reporting forms and contact information in Section 7.6. The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end of the pregnancy, last menstruation, estimated conception date, pregnancy result, and neonatal data, etc, should be included in this information , as available.

Vital Si gns, Physical Examinations, Clinical Laboratory Tests, Electrocardiograms, and Bone Mineral Density Measures Section 6.8.2 details the requirements for measurement of safety parameters including vital signs, physical and gynecologic examinations, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms and bone mineral dens ity. 7.10. Benefi t/Risk Assessment Adverse drug reactions (identified risks) associated with relugolix in women include nonserious events of hot flush, headache, hyperhidrosis, and loss of bone mineral density . In this protocol, relugolix will be evaluated for its benefit on the heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. Low-dose hormonal add -back therapy with estradiol and norethindrone acetate will be evaluated for maintenance of bone mineral density during treatment with relugolix . Potential risks that may be associated with relugolix treatment in women, based on nonclinical data and data available for similar compounds, include drug interactions, cardiovascular effects (QTc prolongation), hepatic enzyme increases, PLD , reproductive toxicity, and metabolic and cardiovascular changes (insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, increased weight) with an increased risk of diabetes mellitus and possible increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Additionally, there are potential risks associated with the ad dition of estradiol/norethindrone acetate. Summaries of findings from both nonclinical and clinical studies conducted with relugolix can be found in the current version of the Investigator Brochure. The risk assessment and mitigation strategy for this protocol are outlined in Table 7-2. Table 7-2 Protocol Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies Potent ial Risk of Clinical Significance Mitiga tion Strategy Impact on Eligibility Monitoring and Withdra wal Criteria Bone Mineral Density Reversible loss of bone mineral density is a risk of the hypoestrogenic state induced by relugolix.

STATIST ICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND DATA ANALYSES A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will describe the detailed statistical methods and analyses for this stud y. The SAP will be prepared and finalized prior to unblinding of patien ts’ study treatment assignments. All hypothesis tests and confidence interval s will be 2 - sided at an alpha level of 5%. Methodology to be used to maintain study- wide type I error rate of 5% across primary and secondary endpoint testing will be described in the SAP. All efficacy and safety measures over the course of the study will be presen ted. Continuous data will be summarized by means, standard deviations, medians, maximum, minimum, and number of patien ts. Categorical data will be summarized by counts and percentages. 9.1. Randomiz ation Methods Central randomization will be used and treatment allocation will be 1:1:1 to relug olix plus low- dose hormonal add -back therapy (Group A) , relugolix monotherapy plus placebo followed by relugolix plus low-dose hormonal add -back therapy (Group B) , and placebo (Group C). Randomization will be stratified by the following factors: • Geographic Region: North America versus Rest of World; and • Mean s creening menstrual blood loss using alkaline hematin method: < 225 mL versus ≥ 225 mL . Statistical analyses for all efficacy endpoints will incorporate these stratification factors unless otherwi se specified. 9.2. Analysis Populations The Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Population will consist of all patien ts randomized to treatment who have taken at least one dose of study treatment. This will be the primary populatio n used for the efficacy analysis. The Per -Protocol Population will consist of those members of the ITT Population who have no relevant major protocol violations , defined as a subset of all major protocol violations (details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan).

Good C linical Practice The investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in accordance with the principles of the “Decla ration of Helsinki” (as amended in Edinburgh, Tokyo, Venice, Hong Kong, and South Africa), International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the study participant. For studies conducted under a United States investigational new drug application, the i nvestigator will ensure t hat the basic principles of “Good Clinical Practice,” as outlined in 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR 312), subpart D, “Responsibilities of Sponsors and Investigators,” 21 CFR, part 50, 1998, and 21 CFR, part 56, 1998, are adhered to. These standards are consistent with the requirements of the European Community Directive 2001/20/EC. Since this is a “covered” clinical study, the investigator will ensure that 21 CFR, Part 54, 1998, is adhered t o; a “covered” clinical study is any “study of a drug or device in humans submitted in a marketing application or reclassification petition subject to this part that the applicant or FDA relies on to establish that the product is effective (including studies that show equivalence to an effective product) or that make a significant contribution to the demonstration of safety.” This requires that investigators and all sub-investigators must provide documentation of their financial interest or arrangements with the sponsor, or proprietary interests in the drug being studied. This documentation must be provided before participation of the investigator and any sub-investigator. The investigator and sub- investigator agree to notify the sponsor of any change in reportable interests during the study and for one year follow ing completion of the study . 10.1.2.

Any modifications made to the protocol after receipt of IRB or IEC approval must also be submitte d to the IRB or IEC for approval before implementation. 10.1.3. Informe d Consent The investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from each individual partici pating in this study after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study and before undertaking any study -related procedures. The investigator must utilize an IRB - or IEC -approved informed consent form for documenting written informed consent that contains all elements required by national, state, local , and institutional regulations or requirements. Each informed consent form will be appropriately signed and dated by the patien t. 10.1.4. Confide ntiality The investigator must assure that patient s’ anon ymity will be strictly maintained and that their identities are protected from unauthorized parties. Only patient number, date of birth, and an identification code (ie, not names) should be recorded on any form or biological sample submitted to the sponsor, IRB or IEC, or laboratory. The investigator must keep a screening log showing codes, names, and addresses for all patien ts screened and for all patien ts enrolled in the study. The investigator agrees that all information received from the sponsor, including but not limited to the IB, prot ocol, e CRFs and other study forms, the investigational drug, and any other study information, remain the sole and exclusive property of the sponsor during the conduct of the study and thereafter. This information is not to be disclosed to any third party (except employees or agents directly involved in the conduct of the study or as required by law) without prior written consent from the sponsor. The i nvestigator further agrees to take all reasonable precautions to prevent the disclosure by any employee or agent of the study site to any third party or otherwise into the public domain. 10.1.5. Study Comm ittees and Communication There will be two formal committees for this study, a Steering Committee and a Data and Safety Monitoring Board .

Study File s and Retention of Records The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents should be classified into at least the following two categories: 1) Investigator’s study file. The investigator’s study file will contain the IB, protocol/ amendments, IRB or IEC and governmental approval with correspondence, informed consent forms, drug records, staff curriculum vitae, authorization and training forms, and other appropriate documents and correspondence. 2) Patien t clinical source documents. The required source data should include the following for each patien t: • Patient identification (name, date of birth, gender); • Docum entation that the patien t meets e ligibility criteria, (eg, history, physical examination, and confirmation of diagnosis to support inclusion and exclusion criteria); • Participation in the study (including study number); • Study discussed and date of informed consent; • Dates of all visits; • Docume ntation that protocol- specifi c procedures were performed; • Results of efficacy parameters, as required by the protocol; • Star t and end date (including dose regimen) of st udy medica tion (drug dispensing and return should be documented as well); • Record of all adverse events and other safety parameters (start and end date, and causalit y and intensity as assigned by the investigator ); • Concomitant medication (including start an d end d ate); and • Date of study completion and reason for early discontinuation, if applicable. All clinica l study documentation must be retained by the investigator until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region (ie, United States, Europe, or Japan) and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or, if no application is filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until 2 years after the investigation is discontinued and regulatory authorities have been notified. Investigators may be required to retain documents longer if required by applicable regulatory requirements, by local regulations, or by an agreement with the sponsor. The i nvestigator must notify the sponsor before destroying any clinical study records. Clinical study documentation includes the IB, signed protocol and amendments, signed informed consents, notification of serious adverse events and related reports, any dispensing and accountabili ty logs, shipping records of investigational product and study- related materials, documentation of financial aspects of the study , insurance statement, and signed agreement between the involved parties, dated and documented IRB/IEC approval, approval of regulatory Myovant Sciences GmbH 88 CONFIDENTIAL MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1.

Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, t he sponsor must be notified in advance. If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of the docum ents, special arrangements must be made between the investigator and the sponsor to store these in sealed containers outside of the site so that they can be returned sealed to the investigator in case of a regulatory audit. When source documents are required for the continued care of the patient , appropriate copies should be made for storage outside of the site. 10.1.7. Electroni c Case Report Forms For each patien t enroll ed, an eCRF must be completed and signed by the i nvestigator or sub-investigator (as appropriate) listed on the 1572 and/or other appropriate local health authority documents within a reasonable time period after data collection. This also applies to records for those patien ts who fail to complete the study (even during a pre-randomization screening period if an eCRF was initiated). If a patien t withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the eCRF. If a patien t is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment- limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. 10.1.8. Investi gational Product Accountability The investigator or investigator’s designee (ie, pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate accountabi lity (including dates and lot numbers) of all used and unused study drug (active and placebos). This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study product (quantity and condition), patien t dispensing records, and returned or destroyed study product. Dispensing records will document quantities received from the sponsor and quantities dispensed to patien ts, including lot number, date dispensed, Patient Identification Number, and the initials of the person dispensing the medication. At study initiation, the study monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for investiga tional medicinal product disposal/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with the sponsor requirements. Drug may be returned or destroyed on an ongoing basis during the study if appropriate. At the end of the study, following final drug inventory r econciliation by the monitor, the study site will dispose of and/or destroy all unused study drug supplies, including empty containers, according to these procedures. If the site cannot meet the sponsor’s requirements for disposal, arrangements will be ma de between the site and the sponsor ( or designee) for destruction or return of unused investigational medicinal product supplies. All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by the study monitor over the course of the study.

Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Objectives • To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) an d pharmacodynamic effects of 24 weeks of relugolix 40 mg once daily when co -administered with either 12 or 24 weeks of low -dose estr adiol and norethindrone acetate. Exploratory Objectives • To determine the benefit of 24 weeks of relugolix 40 mg once daily co- administered with either 12 or 24 weeks of low-dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate compared with placebo on patient -reported quality of life outcome measures. Study Design This study is an international phase 3 randomized, double -blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study to evaluate 24 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate and 12 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily followed by 12 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with low-dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate compared with 24 weeks of placebo. Approximately 390 women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids will be enrolled and randomized 1:1:1 to the relugolix plus low -dose hormonal add-back therapy group (Group A; N ≈ 130), the relugolix monotherapy followed by co- administration with low -dose hormonal add-back therapy group ( Group B; N ≈ 130), or placebo group (Group C ; N ≈ 130). Stratification variables will include : geographic region (North America versus Rest of World) and mean screening menstrual blood loss volume (< 225 mL versus ≥ 225 mL) by the alkaline hematin method . The study consists of a screening period ( up to ~ 13 weeks), a randomized treatment period (24 weeks), and a follow -up period (~30 days). Additionally, unscheduled follow -up visit(s) may be arranged for patients with study -related safety concerns and as needed. A diagnosis of uteri ne fibroids will be confirmed during the screening p eriod by centrally -reviewed transvaginal (with or without a transabdominal ultrasound). Heavy menstrual bleeding will be defined as menstrual blood loss of ≥ 80 mL per cycle for 2 cycles or ≥ 160 mL during 1 cycle during the screening p eriod . During the randomized treatment period, study participants will take blinded study treatment orally once daily for 24 weeks. Women with iron-deficient microcytic anemia and hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL and ≤ 10 g/dL at Screening must be treated with oral or parenteral iron replacement therapy . Between the Baseline Day 1 and Week 24 visits , patients will attend visits monthly (ie, every 4 weeks). At the Screening , Week 12, and Week 24 visits, patients will have an assessment of bone mineral density with dual -energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) . An endometrial biopsy will also be performed at Screening . A transvaginal ultrasound (with or without a transabdominal ultrasound) will be performed at Week 24, followed by a repeat endometrial biopsy . Patients will have paired baseline and end-of -treatment endometrial biopsies , independent of ultrasound results. Feminine products will be standardized and will be collected and assessed for blood loss by the alkaline hematin method. Complete blood counts and chemistries will be collected monthly and uterine MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 159"

Patients will complete daily electronic diaries (eDiary) including compliance with study treatment, menstrual bleeding, use of feminine products for menstrual bleeding, uterine fibroid -associated pain by the Numerical Rating Scale , and use of pain medication to treat pain caused by uterine fibroids. Quality of life questionnair es will be completed according to the Schedule of Activities. Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring adverse events, vital signs, physical exam inations including visual acuity , clinical laboratory tests , 12-lead electrocardiograms, endometrial biops ies, and assessments of bone mineral density . Height will be measured at the Screening 1 visit and weight will be measured at specified intervals . Samples will be collected for PK assessment of relugolix, estradiol, and norethindrone and for the pharmacodynamic assessment of luteinizing hormone (LH) , follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol, and progesterone . All patients completing the Week 24 visit, including women randomized to placebo, will be offered the opportunity to enroll in an open-label extension study in which all eligible patients will receive relugolix co-administered with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate. Patients who do not enroll into the extension study will have a follow -up visit approximately 30 days after the end of treatment (ie, after the patient’s last dose of study medication). Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Inclusion Criteria (all inclusion criteria must have been met prior to randomization unless otherwise specified): 1. Has voluntarily signed and dated the informed consent form prior to initiation of any screening or study -specific procedures; 2. Is a premenopausal female aged 18 to 50 years old (inclusive) on the day of signing and dating the informed consent form; 3. Has regularly -occurring menstrual periods of ≤ 14 days duration with a cycle of 21 to 38 days from the start of one menstrual period until the start of the next, by patient history for at least 3 months prior to the Screening 1 visit; 4. Has a diagnosis of uterine fibroids that is confirmed by a transvaginal ultrasound performed during the screening period ; at least one uterine fibroid must be verified by a central reader to meet at least one of the following criteria: a. Subserosal, intramural, or < 50% intracavitary submucosal fibroid with a diameter ≥ 2 cm (longest diameter), or b. Multiple small fibroids with a total uterine volume of ≥ 130 cm3 Note 1: Once the transvaginal ultrasound is done, a transabdominal ultrasound may also be done if the uterus cannot be adequately imaged on transvaginal ultrasound; for example, due to enlarged size. Note 2: Saline or gel contrast is not required, but may be performed to demonstrate fibroids that meet the criterion for inclusion if these are not adequately visualized with transvaginal ultrasound alone; 5. Has heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids as evidenced by a menstrual blood loss of ≥ 160 mL during 1 cycle or ≥ 80 mL per cycle for 2 menstrual cycles as measured by the alkaline hematin method during the screening period; 6. Patient is not expected to undergo gynecological surgery or ablation procedures for uterine fibroids within the 6 months following enrollment; 7. Has a negative urine pregnancy test at the Screening 1, Screening 3, and Baseline Day 1 visits; 8. Agrees to use two forms of non -hormonal contraception (dual contraception , as described in MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 160"

Statistical Methods Efficacy The efficacy analyses will be conducted using an I ntent -to-Treat (ITT) P opulation defined as all randomized patients , unless otherwise specified in the statistical analysis plan . Randomization will be 1:1:1 with the stratification variables of geographic region and mean screening menstrual blood loss volume (mL per alkaline hematin method) as follows: • Geographic Region: North America versus Rest of World; • Mean screening menstrual blood loss volume : < 225 mL versus ≥ 225 mL. The randomization stratification factors will be incorporated into inferential testing of all efficacy endpoints, unless otherwise specified. The primary hypothesis tested in this study is whether relugolix co -administered wi th 1.0 mg estradiol and 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate is superior to placebo in the percentage of women who achieve both a menstrual blood loss volume of < 80 mL AND at least a 50% reduction in menstrual blood loss volume over the last 35 days on treatment as compared with B aseline. The point estimate and 2 -sided 95% confidence interval of the difference in the proportion will be calculated between the relugolix G roup A and placebo Group C. The between -treatment comparisons will be performed using the Cochran -Mantel-Haenszel method. The comparisons of the relugolix arms versus placebo will be performed for the secondary efficacy and safety endpoints using appropriate statistical methods. Comparisons between the two relugolix arms will be descriptive. A closed testing procedure will be used to control the overall type I error rate of 5% across primary and secondary endpoi nt testing. Details of this procedure will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.

Uterine Fibroids with Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Uterine leiomyomas (often referred to as fibroids or myomas) are common benign, estrogen- dependent tumors that grow in the muscular wall of the uterus and occur in approximately 25% of women of reproductive age. While the majority of uterine fibroids are asymptomatic, approximately 25% of women with fibroids develop symptoms requiring treatment. The most problematic symptom for women with uterine fibroids is heavy menstrual bleeding, with menstrual periods of increased duration and volume. In women with uterine fibroids, menstrual periods can last as long as 10 to 14 days rather than the usual 5 to 7 days, and blood loss can be as high as 300 to 500 mL , with anything more than 80 mL during a given cycle considered abnormal. The heavy menstrual bleeding associated with ute rine fibroids is likely caused by the increase in surface area of the uterine cavity, poor uterine contraction due to the myoma, and increased circulation, congestion, or impaired hemostasis due to hypertrophy of the endometrium near the myoma [Hapangama, 2016 ]. Persistent heavy menstrual bleeding can induce iron- deficiency anemia and associated fatigue and loss of energy. Heavy menstrual bleeding is a primary reason for the deterioration in the health -related quality of life assessed in patients with uterine fibroids and is a major cause of elective hysterectomy. Other symptoms include bulk symptoms , such as pain or pressure in the abdomen and pelvis due to large myoma(s) , low back pain, urinary frequency or urinary tract obstruction , constipation, and pregnancy loss. The incidence of uterine fibroids increases as women grow older, and risk factors include nulliparity, obesity, family history, b lack race, and hypertension. Fibroids typically arise during the reproductive year s, tend to enlarge during pregnancy and regress after menopause as these tumors are dependent upon estrogen and progesterone for their growth . Transvaginal ultrasound is used most commonly to diagnose these benign tumors, and magnetic resonance imaging, sonohysterography, and hysteroscopy are used to evaluate their size and position. The type of treatment recommended for uterine fibroids typically depends upon their size, location, the patient’s age, reproductive plans, and obstetrical history. Few medical options are available for women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and approximately 60% of women who received medical therapy in one study underwent a surgical proce dure within 2 years [Marjoribanks , 2006], suggesting many women are inadequately treated with the currently available medical therapies. Combined hormonal contraceptives and progestational agents are commonly prescribed to regulate abnormal uterine bleeding, but appear to have limited efficacy in the treatm ent of uterine fibroids [Carr, 1993]. Although no randomized studie s evaluating the use of levonorgestrel- releasing intrauterine system devices for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding related to uterine fibroids have been conducted, observational studies have reported a reduction in uterine volume and bleeding and this system is approved for use by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists such as leuprolide acetate (also known as leuprorelin) are effective in lowering estrogen and progesterone levels, decreasing menstrual bleeding, and decreasing fibroid size, however they cannot be used for more than 6 months due to bone mineral density loss from the resulting hypoestrogenic state. The GnRH agonists, which MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 173"

This initial rise in hormonal levels is followed by a gradual decline in levels over 4 weeks as the pituitary becomes desensitized to the chronic stimulation of the GnRH agonist and LH and FSH level s fall. Other medical treatments are used but have limited clinical effectiveness, including tranexamic acid, aromatase inhibitors, non- steroidal anti -inflammatory medications, and danazol. The current mainstay of treatment for women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids is surgery. Several surgical procedures are frequently performed including myomectomy by various techniques, endometrial ablation, endometrial uteri ne artery embolization, and magnetic resonance-guided focused-ultrasound surgery. Each of these procedures has complications. For example, abdominal myomectomy result s in complications requiring hysterectomy in up to 3 to 4% of cases, along with the frequent development of intraoperative adhesions [Gliklich , 2011]. Furthermore, recurrence after myomectomy is common with at least 25 % of women requiring additional treatment [Stewart , 2015, Marret , 2012, ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 96 , 2008]. Hysterectomy is the definitive procedure and more than 250,000 hysterectomies are performed in the US for uterine fibroids. M ajor complications have been reported to occur in up to 25% of women undergoing hysterectomy, including infection, severe bleeding, and injuries to the urethra, bowel or bladder. One study showed that among women with Medicaid insurance who underwent abdominal hysterectomy, there was a 10% risk of transfusion and up to a 28% risk of medical or surgical complications including major blood loss, wound infection and febrile episodes [Gliklich , 2011]. Approximately 3 million women in the United States suffer from symptomatic uterine fibroids that are inadequately treated with medical th erapy , and related US health care costs for uterine fibroids exceeds $34 billion [ Stewart , 2015; Cardozo , 2012, Gliklich , 2011]. There is a great need for a medicine that can decrease the symptoms of uterine fibroids and can be safely administered so that women have an option other than surgical procedures such as myomectomy and hysterectomy. 2.2. Relugolix 2.2.1. Indication Relugolix co -administered wi th low-dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate is being developed as a once daily oral medication for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. The proposed dose of relugolix is 40 mg administered orally once daily and the proposed doses of estradiol and norethindrone acetate are 1 mg and 0.5 mg once daily, respectively . 2.2.2. Pharmacology Relugolix ( also known as TAK-385) is an orally -active, potent, highly- selective high- affinity small molecule GnRH receptor antagonist with a novel structure. Relugolix was discovered and initially studied by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Limited, before development rights outside of Japan and certain East Asian countries were licensed to Myovant Sciences GmbH .

175,page_175,"Clinical Study Protocol: MVT-601-3001 Amendment 1, Effective: 08-FEB -2017 Myovant Sciences GmbH 28 CONFIDENTIAL Relugolix antagonizes the human GnRH receptors present on the gonadotropin -secreting cells of the anterior pituitary by competitively inhibiting binding of the active ligand, GnRH, to the GnRH receptors. In the absence of GnRH- stimulated secretion by the anterior pituitary, levels of LH and FSH f all rapidly , followed by a decline over a few days in estradiol and progesterone levels. Relugolix acts as a potent and highly selective antagonist for the human GnRH receptor . The affinity of relugolix for the human GnRH receptor in vitro was approximately 50-fold higher than that of GnRH in the presence of protein (40% fetal bovine serum). Transgenic knock-in mice expressing the human GnRH receptor treated with relugolix had substantial reductions in reproductive organ weights of both female and male mice, suggesting that relugolix may suppress blood estrogen and testosterone levels, respectively. Orally administered relugolix suppressed the hypothalamic -pituitary axis in castrated cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 1 mg/kg and higher. 2.2.3. Nonclinical Toxicology A comprehensive package of nonclinical studies has been conducted to evaluate the toxicity of relugolix. These include repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice of up to 13 weeks, in rats of up to 26 weeks, and in monkeys of up to 39 weeks. Oral administration of relugolix resulted in reversible liver toxicity (liver enzyme elevations with and without accompanying histopathological correlates) and changes related to reversible phospholipidosis (PLD) in several tissues/organs, most notably the lymph nodes, lungs, and testes in rats; and lymph nodes, parietal cells in the stomach, spleen, and intestines in monkeys. P LD by itself is not adverse, and no significant adverse effects were associated with PLD in rats and monkeys except at doses that caused mortality i n rats (≥ 1000 mg /kg/day), which were associated with extremely high systemic exposures. The no- observed -effect level (NOEL) for liver findings in the 39 -week monkey toxicity study was 5 mg /kg/day, and the no-observed-adverse- effect level (NOAEL) is considered to be 15 mg /kg/day. The gender combined mean end of study area under the concentration -time curve from time 0 to 24 hours ( AUC 0-24) at the NOAEL of 15 mg/kg/day was 5.2 μg⋅hr/mL, which is ~51 times higher than the estimated exposure (AUC) in women r eceiving 40 mg once daily (0.101 μg⋅hr/mL), the dose of relugolix to be administered in this study. Both the liver and PLD findings demonstrated evidence of reversibility following a 13-week recovery period in monkeys. No evidence of PLD has been observe d in clinical studies. The relugolix toxicology program supports the conduct of clinical studies up to the NOAEL (15 mg/kg/day) exposure (5.2 μg ⋅hr/mL) for liver toxicity in monkeys (most sensitive species). Relugolix is not mutagenic or clastogenic and was not carcinogenic in 2- year mouse and rat studies. Embryo-fetal death was observed only in relugolix-treated pregnant rabbits, but no fetal malformation was observed in rat and rabbit embryo-fetal development studies. While relugolix demonstrated phototoxic potential in an in vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake assay, in vivo data did not show phototoxicity in hairless mice, and no damage to the eye structure or function was evident in the 4- and 39-week monkey toxicity studies. Prolongation of the corrected QT interval was observed in a study of cynomolgus monkeys at ≥ 100 mg /kg (estimated C max of 4.0 µg/mL), but did not prolong the QT interval in a human thorough QT study at doses up to 360 mg (C max of 0.181 µg/mL).

Previous Human Experience Nine phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and 3 phase 2 studies (including 1 in women with uterine fibroids and 1 in women with endometriosis) have been completed. In addition, 6 clinical studie s evaluating relugolix are ongoing, including 2 p hase 1 studies, 2 phase 2 studies in men with prostate cancer (US and Europe), and 2 phase 3 studies in women with uterine fibroids in Japan. More than 1380 patients and healthy volunteers have received at least 1 dose of relugolix , including 158 women receiving relugolix 40 mg once daily (the proposed phase 3 dose) for at least 28 days and at least 200 men receiving relugolix at doses of 80 mg or 120 mg once daily for at least 24 weeks and for as long as 48 weeks. Eighty- eight women have been treated with relugolix 40 mg once daily for 24 weeks. 2.2.4.1. Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics, and Metabolism Data from phase 1 studies demonstrate that relugolix treatment results in rapid, dose -dependent suppression of estradiol in female subjects and testosterone in male subjects. After oral administration, the absolute bioavailability of relugolix was 12% (range 6 to 25%) with a predominant elimination half-life of 37 to 42 hours. In a human radiolabeled study, there were no major circulating metabolites of relugolix. The primary route of elimination of drug- related material was in the feces. The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics of relugolix have been evaluated, and appear to be similar in American and Japanese volunteers, despite the lower mean body mass index observed in Japanese volunteers. A phase 1 study ( TAK-385_101) in healthy US premenopausal women demonstrated the tolerability of single doses of relugolix 1 to 80 mg , and once-daily dosing of relugolix at 10, 20, and 40 mg for 2 weeks. Plasma concentrations of relugolix increased in a slightly greater than dose-proportional manner. Suppression of serum estradiol was similar after single doses of 40 or 80 mg once daily relugolix. The serum concentrations of LH, FSH, estradiol, and progesterone rapidly decreased and remained at low levels with multiple doses of relugolix with the majority of women having estradiol levels < 10 pg/mL in the 40-mg dose group. Based on these hormone reductions, oral relugolix 40 mg once daily was chosen as the high dose for further study in phase 2. A 6-week phase 1 study (MVT-601-1001) in healthy US premenopausal women was conducted to evaluate the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics profile of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily and relugolix 40 mg once daily in combination with estradiol/norethindrone acetate (1 mg/0.5 mg once daily). Median pre-dose trough concentrations of estradiol in the relugolix alone arm w ere ~6 pg/mL; with the addition of 1 mg estradiol once daily, these were increased to ~26 pg /mL, and median peak concentrations were ~45 pg/mL. This trough and peak concentration range is consistent with the estradiol range associated with reduced loss of bone mineral density [Barbieri, 1992]. Relugolix PK and norethindrone acetate PK were similar to historic data. The estrogenic metabolite of norethindrone, ethinyl estradiol, was below the limit of quantitation in almost all PK samples co llected. The adverse event profile was similar to prior phase 1 studies , with a marked reduction in hot flushes noted in the relugolix plus hormonal add- back therapy in comparison with the relugolix alone arm. Relugolix is to be administered in the fasted state, as food decreases the extent of relugolix absorption (AUC) by approximately 19%. The exposure of relugolix is increased by inhibitors MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 176"

Clinical Studies in Women with Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis and Men with Prostate Cancer A phase 2 study (TAK-385/CCT- 001) evaluated the efficacy, safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics of relugolix 10, 20, and 40 mg once daily for 12 weeks in 216 Japanese women with uterine fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding. Heavy menstrual bleeding was defined for enrollment into the study as a score on the Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBAC) of at least 120 ; uterine fibroids were confirmed by ultras ound, magnetic resonance imaging , computed tomography, or laparoscopy. For the primary endpoint (proportion of patien ts with a total PBAC score of < 10 from Week 6 to 12), statistically significant dose-dependent differences were observed in all relugolix treatment groups compared to placebo ( Figure 2-1) . The proportion was higher in the relugolix 40 mg group (83.6%) compared with 0% in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). In the relugolix 20 mg group, 43.6% of women responded and in the 10 mg group 20.8% responded, demonstrating a dose-response relationship. Of the women in the relugolix 40 mg group, 72.7% achieved amenorrhea from Week 6 to Week 12. Similarly, improvement with increasing dose was also observed in the secondary endpoints including change in myoma and uterine volumes and blood concentration of hemoglobin.

With the exception of the incidence of nasopharyngitis in all treatment groups, t hese common adverse events were thought to be caused by the pharmacological effect of relugolix. The adverse events associated with menstruation were primarily reported in the first 28 days. Most of the adverse events were mild or moderate, and no serious treatment- emergent adverse event considered related to study drug w as observed. Adverse events resulted in study drug discontinuation in 2 patients (hemoglobin decreased in a placebo patient and tinnitus, libido decreased, menopausal depression and hyperhidrosis in one patient treated with relugolix 20 mg once daily). Bone mineral density decreases appeared to correlate with increasing doses of relugolix . Women treated with placebo for 12 weeks had a mild loss of bone mineral density (mean ± standard deviation [ SD]) of -0.24 ± 2.218% compared with -0.75 ± 2.350%, -2.01 ± 2.334%, and -2.28 ± 2.194% in the relugolix 10, 20, and 40 mg once daily groups, respectively . One patient had a positive pregnancy test after receiving approximately 46 days of relugolix 10 mg once daily (a dose that does not fully suppress estradiol). Study drug was discontinued. An ultrasound determined that the patient was 7 weeks pregnant. The patient subsequently had an uneventful pregnancy and delivered a healthy infant at 39 weeks. In a phase 2 study of women with endometriosis (TAK-385/CCT-101), 487 women were randomized to relugolix doses of 10, 20, or 40 mg or placebo, administered orally once daily over a 12-week period, or to leuprolide acetate (every 4- week injection ) administered for 12 weeks. The study demonstrated dose- dependent decreases in pelvic pain as assessed by a 100 mm visual analogue score (VAS). The pain scores for pelvic pain were well- balanced across the groups at baseline and the means ranged from 14.6 to 15.6 mm. The changes from baseline in the VAS score (mean ± SD) were -10.418 ± 1 1.0171 mm in the relugolix 40 mg group vs. - 3.753 ± 10.5018 mm in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). All doses were better than placebo, with the greatest benefit observed at the highest dose evaluated, 40 mg once daily. The decrease in mean VAS pain score for the leupro lide group (-10.460 ± 10.3013 mm ) was similar to that of the relugolix 40 mg group. The effects of relugolix on pain were maintained following an additional 12 weeks of treatment in the extension study (total of 24 weeks). Estradiol levels were suppressed for the duration of the study. In the 12- week phase 2 endometriosis study (CCT -101) and the companion 12- week extension study ( OCT -101; total of 24 weeks of treatment), the safety p rofile of the relugolix 40 mg once daily dose was comparable to that of leuprolide treatment. The mo st commonly reported treatment-emergent adverse events in the relugolix groups than in the placebo group included hot flush, metrorrhagia, and menstruation irregular, and were considered to be due to the pharmacological effects of relugolix. The events of menstrual bleeding were primarily reported in the first 28 days. Bone mineral density changes from baseline (mean ± standard deviation [SD]) observed after 24 weeks of treatment were -0.23 ± 1.986% in the placebo group, -1.61 ± 2.338%, -2.58 ± 2.936%, and -4.90 ± 2.912% in the relugolix 10, 20, and 40 mg groups respectively, and -4.43 ± 2.157% in the leupro lide group. Bone mineral density changes from baseline in the relugolix 40 mg group at 12 and 24 weeks were comparable to th ose in the leupro lide group for the same durations.

One study is assessing the effect of relugolix in women with moderate to severe pain associated with uterine fibroids, and the other is evaluating women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. Da ta from these ongoing studies are not available. Two phase 2 clinical studie s of relugolix (C27002 and C27003) in men with advanced pros tate cancer requiring androgen deprivation therapy were initiated in North America in 2014. Study C27002, which remains ongoing, enrolled patients with advanced prosta te cancer. In this open- label, parallel g roup study, men were randomized to receive oral relugolix at a dose of 80 mg or 120 mg once daily after a single oral loading dose of 320 mg (N = 50 in each arm) or to the GnRH agonist therapy, leuprolide acetate, 22.5 mg administered subcutaneously every 12 weeks, (N = 25) for up to 48 weeks. Study C27003, in which the last clinical study visits have been completed, enrolled men in North America or the United Kingdom requiring six months of androgen deprivation therapy as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy to external beam radiation therapy. Patients were randomized to relugolix 120 mg once daily (after a single oral loading dose of 320 mg ) (N = 65) or to degarelix 80 mg subcutaneously every four weeks ( N = 38) for 24 weeks (after a single loading dose of 240 mg). Results from the C27002 final analysis demonstrated that both doses of oral relugolix, 80 mg and 120 mg once daily, rapidly reduced testosterone levels belo w the castration threshold (≤ 50 ng/dL) and maintained these levels through at least 24 weeks. These 24- week data were comparable to testosterone levels achieved by leupro lide 22.5 mg administered by injection every 3 months. Study C27003 also demonstrated rapid and sustained suppression of testosterone levels by relugolix for the 24- week treatment duration. In an interim analysis of the phase 2 prostate cancer study C27002, the most common treatment- emergent adverse events occurring in at least 10% of men with advanced prostate cancer in the relugolix 80 mg or 120 mg once daily arms or leuprolide arm included hot flush, alanine aminotransferase increase, fatigue, aspartate aminotransferase, diabetes mellitus, hyperhidrosis, muscle spasm, injecti on site reaction , and frequent daytime urination. The common adverse events observed with relugolix in men with prostate cancer were generally consistent with its mechanism of action and those observed with leuprolide . A biomarker for P LD, di-22:6- bis(mo noacylglycerol)phosphate ( di-22:6- BMP ), was monitored in this study due to findings of PLD in nonclinical toxicity studies. There were no systematic increases in post -baseline serum or urinary di-22:6- BMP levels and no changes exceeding 2- fold observed in any patients. No clinical evidence of relugolix- related PLD -associated toxicity has been observed regarding the heart, liver, central nervous system, or muscle in any clinical study. Relugolix has been generally well tolerated. The serious id entified risk associated with relugolix treatment is loss of bone mineral density in women. Nonserious adverse events related to relugolix class effects include hot flush and headache in both sexes; reproductive system events (abnormal uterine bleeding, genital hemorrhage, menorrhagia or heavy menstrual bleeding, menstruation irregular, and oligomenorrhea), arthralgia, and hyperhidrosis in women with uterine fibroids or endometriosis ; and vision blurred, hepatic enzyme increased, libido decreased, and anxi ety in men.

Approximately 390 women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids will be enrolled and randomized 1:1:1 to the relugolix plus low- dose hormonal add-back therapy group (Group A ; N ≈ 130), the relugolix monotherapy followed by co -administration with low -dose hormonal add-back therapy group (Group B; N ≈ 130), or the placebo group ( Group C; N ≈ 130). Stratification variables will include : geographic region (North America versus Rest of World) and mean screening menstrual blood loss volume (< 225 mL versus ≥ 225 mL) by the alkaline hematin method. The study consists of a screening period ( up to ~13 weeks), a randomized treatment period (24 weeks), and a follow-up period ( ~30 days). Additionally, unscheduled follow- up visit(s) may be arranged for patien ts with study -related safety concerns and as needed . A diagnosis of uterine fibroids will be confir med during the s creening period by a centrally - reviewed transvaginal ultra sound (with or without a transabdominal ultrasound). Heavy menstrual bleeding will be defined as menstrual blood loss of ≥ 80 mL per cycle for 2 cycles or MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 182"

During the randomized treatment period, study participants will take blinded study drug orally once daily for 24 weeks . Women with iron -deficient microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dL at Screening must be treated with oral or parenteral iron replacement therapy. Between the Baseline and Week 24 visits, patients will attend visits monthly (ie, every 4 weeks). At the Screening , Week 12, and Week 24 visits, patients will have an assessment of bone minera l density with dual-energy x- ray absorptiometry (DXA) . An endometrial biopsy will also be performed at the Screening visit. A transvaginal ultrasound (with or without a transabdominal u ltrasound) will be performed at Week 24, followed by a repeat endomet rial biopsy. Feminine products will be standardized and will be collected and assessed for blood loss by the alkaline hematin method. Complete blood counts and chemistries will be collected monthly and uterine and uterine fibroid volumes will be assessed at the Screening and Week 24 visits . Patients will complete daily electronic diaries (eDiary) including compliance with study treatment, menstrual bleeding, use of feminine products for menstrual bleeding, uterine fibroid- associated pain by the Numerical Rating Scale, and use of pain medication to treat pain caused by uterine fibroids. Quality of life questionnaires will be completed according to the Schedule of Activities . Safety assessments will include treatment -emergent adverse event s, vital signs, physical examinations including visual acuity , clinical laboratory tests , 12-lead electrocardiograms, endometrial biopsies, and assessments of bone mineral density . Samples will also be collected for PK assessment of relugolix, estradiol, and norethindrone, and for the pharmacodynamic assessment of LH, FSH , estradiol, and progesterone. All patients completing the Week 24 visit, including women randomized to placebo, will be offered the opportunity to enroll in an open-label extension study in which all eligible patients will receive relugolix co -administered with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate. Patients who do not enroll into the extension study will have a follow-up visit to assess safety approximately 30 days after the end of treatment (ie, after the patient’s last dose of study medication).

Discussion of Study Design, Inc luding Dosing Rationale and Choice of Control Group This phase 3 study is one of two replicate studies designed to establish the efficacy and safety of relugolix 40 mg once daily in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. Thi s study will focus on the primary objective of demonstrating a reduction in heavy menstrual bleeding, the most common and burdensome symptom of uterine fibroids. The study is designed to demonstrate the benefit and safety of relugolix co- administered with low-dose estradiol (1 mg) and norethindrone acetate (0.5 mg) for 24 weeks. An additional relugolix arm dosed with 12 weeks of relugolix monotherapy 40 mg once daily followed by 12 weeks of relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with low- dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate will be used to provide an assessment of the requirement for the low-dose hormonal add-back therapy to mitigate the adverse effect s of relugolix monotherapy on bone mineral densi ty loss and vasomotor symptoms. An extension study is planned to provide additional safety and efficacy data through 48 weeks. Women with uterine fibroids and heavy menstrual blood loss by the alkaline hematin method of ≥ 80 mL /cycle for two cycles or ≥ 160 mL in one cycle during screening will be enrolled in this study. Randomization will be 1:1:1 . Placebo was selected as the appropriate control for the study because there is no standard of care medical therapy for the long -term treatment of women with uterine fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding. Commo nly-used t reatment options range from combined oral contraceptive pills , which are not effective in many cases, levonorgestrel - containing intrauterine devices, and leuprolide therapy indicated for 3 month s in the preoperative setting. The dose of relugolix for phase 3 evaluation is 40 mg once daily. This dose was selected for evaluation in phase 2 clinical studies based upon phase 1 data demonstrat ing similar estradiol and progesterone suppression in women treated wi th single doses of relugolix 40 mg or 80 mg, and data demonstrating that premenopausal women treated with multiple doses of 40 mg once daily relugolix over 14 days had estradiol levels suppressed to a median value of 3.68 pg/mL. Data from a phase 2 study in women with endometriosis demonstrated relugolix 40 mg once daily (N = 101) suppressed estradiol levels to below 20 pg/mL in the majority of women, and results were similar to those in the group of women treated with leuprolide subcutaneous injection, 3.75 mg. Women in both the relugolix 40 mg and the leupro lide groups had similar reductions in pelvic pain, the primary endpoint of the study. Finally, as described above, a phase 2 study of doses of relugolix 10, 20 and 40 mg once daily administered to women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids demonstrated the 40 mg dose provided the most reduction in menstrual blood loss and was the optimal dose to move forward into phase 3 development based on efficacy data. However, data on bone mineral density from DXA scanning in both phase 2 studies of premenopausal women with endometriosis or uterine fibroids demonstrated relugolix 40 mg once daily resulted in a degree of bone mineral density loss that is only accep table for short -term dosing. To mitigate this known adverse consequence of estrogen suppression, relugolix will be co-administered with 1 mg estradiol and 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate in this phase 3 clinical study. This low-dose hormonal therapy is currently approved for long-term use to prevent bone mineral density loss and vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women. Although relugolix doses of 20 mg and 10 mg once daily had less bone mineral density loss, these doses did not MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 186"
187,page_187,"Clinical Study Protocol: MVT-601-3001 Amendment 1, Effective: 08-FEB -2017 Myovant Sciences GmbH 40 CONFIDENTIAL provide adequate relief from heavy menstrual bleeding in a high enough percentage of women to move forward into phase 3 clinical development and, based on the DXA data from the phase 2 study, are not expected to prevent bone mineral density loss in a significant majority of women over 48 weeks of treatment. The co -administration of hormonal add-back therapy to relugolix aims to restore estradiol concentrations to a range that alleviates the adverse impact of the hypoestrogenic state on bone mineral density through 48 weeks of treat ment, as well as on vasomotor symptoms such as hot flushes, but without substantial effect on the beneficial decrease in heavy menstrual bl ood loss. It is well known that bone is exquisitel y sensitive to estrogen and low- doses of estrogen are sufficient to prevent bone mineral density loss in a hypoestrogenic state [Barbieri , 1992] . The combination of estradiol with a progestin is commonly used for long-term hormonal add-back therapy to reduce the risk of developing endometrial hyperplasia which can occur with unopposed estrogen therapy [ Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013]. A variety of add- back hormonal therapies have been evaluated in combination with GnRH agonists and antagonists over the last 20 years [Archer , 2015 ; Chwalisz , 2012; Franke , 2000; Hornstein , 1998 ; Morris , 2008; Simpson, 1992; Wu, 2014; Zupi , 2004], and a combination of estradiol and norethindrone acetate has been used as add -back therapy in prior clinical studies with leupro lide (a GnRH agonist) and more recently, the GnRH antagonist elagolix, in each case reducing bone mineral density loss and the incidence of hot flushes without a significant im pact on the decrease in menstrual blood loss [ Archer , 2015; Lee, 2016 ; Franke , 2000]. The estradiol/norethindrone acetate combination proposed for evaluation in this phase 3 study is currently approved in the US as long-term hormone replacement therapy to prevent bone loss and alleviate vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women [ Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013]. A 6-week study in healthy premenopausal women administered oral relugolix 40 mg once daily alone or relugolix 40 mg once daily in combination with 1 mg estradiol and 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate has demonstrated that this dose of add -back therapy maintains serum estradiol in the 2 5-50 pg/mL range, the range historically shown to reduce loss of bone mineral density [ Barbieri , 1992]. Serum N- and C- telopeptide concentrations were also maintained at near baseline levels with the addition of the add -back therapy, suggesting reduced bone resorption compared to the group receiving relugolix alone. Hot flush rate was also considerably reduced with the addition of add-back therapy. The estrogenic metabolite of norethindrone acetate, ethinyl estradiol, was below the limit of quantitation in almost all PK samples collected , and therefore, will not be assessed in this phase 3 study. Th ese data also confirm that lower doses of estradiol/norethindrone acetate (such as the 0.5 mg /0.1 mg combination tablet [Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013]) would not provide sufficient serum estradiol concentrations to protect against the loss of bone mineral density resulting from the hypoestrogenic state induced by once daily administration of relugolix 40 mg. The doses of estradiol and norethindrone acetate used in this study (1 .0 mg and 0.5 mg , respectively) represent less than one fifth the estrogenic effects of an oral contraceptive pill containing 30 µg of ethinyl estradiol. Therefore, this low -dose hormonal add- back therapy is added solely to improve the safety of relugolix therapy and is not included as a control arm as it is expected to have either a neutral or a marginal detrimental effect on efficacy, while mitigating the side effects of relugolix on bone mineral density loss and vasomotor symptoms. In summary, relugolix at a dose of 40 mg once daily resulted in a marked decrease in the heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in a majo rity of women in a well -designed MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1.

H owever, its administration was associated with a degree of bone mineral density loss unacceptable for long- term treatment. This phase 3 study will primarily assess the efficacy and safety of relugolix 40 mg co-administered with a low -dose of estradiol and norethindrone acetate compared with placebo at 24 weeks to decrease heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and to prevent the bone mineral density loss and ameliorate some of the other side effects of a hypoestrogenic state such as hot flushes. An additional arm with monotherapy relugolix administer ed for 12 weeks followed by 12 weeks of relugolix co- administered with low-dose hormonal add- back therapy is included to provide data on the requirement for hormonal therapy to mitigate the adverse relugolix side effects of bone mineral density loss and hot flushes . All e ligible women who complete the 24-week study will be offered the opportunity to enroll in an open- label extensi on study to obtain long- term safety and efficacy data over an additional 28 weeks of treatment, providing approximately 1 year of safety data on the women originally randomized to relugolix. 4.3.

Screening Period Patien ts should have a diagnosis of uterine fibroids and a histo ry of heavy menstrual bleeding with or without as sociated pain on a background of generally regular menses (ie, regularly occurring menstrual periods of ≤ 14 days duration with a cycle of 21 to 38 days from the start of one menstrual period until the start of the next menstrual period ) as reported by the patient for at least 3 mo nths prior to the Screening 1 visit. The screening period consist s of the Screening 1, 2, 3, and 4 visits . See Figure 4-2 for details of the timing of the screening period visits as well as details of the feminine product dispensation and collection during screening. The Screening 4 visit should be skipped if the menstrual blood loss is > 160 mL in the first screening cycle. 6.2.1. Screening 1 Visit The Screening 1 visit will be conducted following the signing of the informed consent form and may occur at any time during the menstrual cycle. The Screening 1 visit will include a full medical history (including menstrual history for 3 months prior to Screening and prior uterine imaging assessments) , review of inclusion and exclusion criteria, collection of concomitant medications , study procedure- related adverse event s and any serious adverse event s. In addition, vital signs, height, weight, temperature, a complete physical examination, gynecology examination, ultrasound, endometrial biopsy, P apanicolaou test (if needed), clinical laboratory tests, urinalysis , and a urine pregnancy test will be done. Feminine products will be dispensed with instructions to collect and return all produc ts used during the next menses. The paper diary will also be dispensed at this visit and should be completed daily starting wi th this visit. The bone mineral density scan and mammogram should be scheduled at this time (or within a few days of this visit). Bone densitometry should be scheduled to be prior to the Screening 3 visit and as early as feasible to ensure results are av ailable prior to randomization . The order of procedures should be as follows. Patients not meeting eligibility criteria after any procedure should not undergo subsequent procedures. • Medical history and review of prior uterine imaging studies • Review of concomitant medications (including supplements and over the counter medications) • Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria • Urine pregnancy test • Vital signs, weight, and height MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1.

Saline or gel contrast may be used but is not required (see Section 4.3 ultrasound entry criteria). The anatomic location and size of the fibroid disease will be estimated by the local reader. The ultrasound images will be submitted to the central reader for confirmation that the patient meets the inclusion criteria for a diagnosis of uterine fibroids (this confirmation must be received prior to randomization). The investigator, rather than the central reader, will determine if any exclusionary pathology is present. If ultrasound fails to demonstrate fibroids on the local reading, do not proceed with additional Screening visit 1 procedures. The Papanicolaou test must be conducted for women without a test result within 6 months prior to the Screening 1 visit and the specimen is to be submitted to the central laboratory. A repeat test should be performed for inadequate or false- positive results and submitted to the central laboratory . The endometrial biopsy will be obtained using a pipelle and submitted to the Central Laboratory.

Patien ts will provide separate informed consent to participate in the extension study during which all patients will receive relugolix 40 mg co- administered with 1.0 mg estradiol / 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate. 6.5. Early Termination Visit and Follow -up Visit All patients withdrawing from the study prior to Week 24 will complete an Early Termination visit. The Early Termination visit procedures are identical to those of Week 24; however, for patients whose last dose of study drug is during Week 6 or earlier, the following procedures do not need to be performed: transvaginal ultrasound (with or without a transabdominal ultrasound) , endometrial biopsy, and bone densitometry. These procedures may be performed, however, at the investigator’s discretion, if they aid in follow-up of ongoing adverse events. All patien ts who do not wish to or who are not eligible to enroll in the extension study (MVT -601-3003), will have a Follow -up visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug, or prior to the date of initiation of another investigational agent or hormonal therapy affecting the hypothalamic- pituitary -gonadal axis or surgical intervention for uterine fibroids , whichever occurs first . This visit will be used to assess safety after discontinuation of study treatment including adverse events, clinical safety laborator ies, 12-lead ECG, and return of menstruation . Patients who withdraw early from this study will also undergo the Follow -up visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug, or the date of initiation of another investigational agent or hormonal therapy affecting the hypothalamic- pituitary -gonadal axis or surgical intervention for uterine fibroids , whichever occurs first . Refer to the Schedule of Activities at the end of the synopsis (see Section 1.1 ) for individual study visit procedures during the Follow-up visit. MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1.

Unscheduled Visits Unscheduled visits may be performed at any time during the study whenever necessary to assess for or follow- up on adverse events, at the patient’s request, or as deemed necessary by the investigator. The date and reason for the Unscheduled visit should be recorded in the source documentation. The following activities shou ld be completed at Unscheduled visits: recording of reason for the visit, concomitant medication review and evaluat ion of adverse events. In addition, procedures such as vital signs, weight, symptom-directed brief physical examination, central safety laboratory assessment , urine pregnancy testing, PK and pharmacodynamic sampl ing, 12-lead ECG, study drug compliance and dispensation, etc. may be conducted as needed . See Schedule of Events ( Section 1.1) for tests that may b e performed if indicated at an unscheduled visit. Consult with the medical monitor, if needed, to discuss Unscheduled visit testing. 6.7. Study Procedures 6.7.1. Efficacy -Related Pr ocedures 6.7.1.1. Menstrual Blood Loss as Assessed by the Alkaline Hematin Method The volume of menstrual blood loss is measured in milliliters using the alkaline hematin method [Hallberg , 1964]. The method involves pummeling used feminine products in a solution and measuring the resulting hematin absorbance against calibration curves. The method is validated in accordance with current FDA Guidance for Method Validations and is an accepted quantitative clinical endpoint for the assessment of heavy menstrual bleeding. The si te staff will provide collection kits with standardized and validated feminine products to patients for the collection and assessment of those products to determine menstrual blood loss. The feminine products will be dispensed and collected at each visit until the patient completes treatment or terminates participation from the study prior to completing treatment. Each time the patient submits her feminine products from a menstrual cycle for analysis, a venous blood sample will be collected and sent to the laboratory. Details regarding materials, process, and requirements for the menstrual blood loss collection will be provided in the Study R eference Manual. 6.7.1.2. Transvaginal and Transabdominal Ultrasound Transvaginal with or without transabdominal ultrasound with or without saline o r gel contrast is performed for the diagnosis of uterine fibroids, to determine uterine and myoma volumes, and to exclude any other uterine or pelvic pathology. To avoid inter- observer and inter -device variations, a single operator will be assigned to a patien t and will perform each of the ultrasound scans using the same device as far as possible. Transvaginal ultrasound will be performed. Once the transvaginal ultrasound is done, a transabdominal ultrasound may also be done if the uterus cannot be adequately imaged on transvaginal ultrasound; for example, due to enlarged size.

The D1, D2, and D3 locally -determined values for the uterus and myoma will be recorded centrally. The images will be submitted for central review to confirm myoma presence and size. At the Screening 1 visit , the longest diameter (D1) of the largest myoma will be noted and recorded. Only the largest myoma among those measurable at the Screening 1 visit will be measured throughout the study. 6.7.1.3. Endometrial Biopsy An endometrial biopsy is to be performed during the pelvic examination at the Screening 3 visit . A pipelle should be used to obtain the specimen. A second biopsy is to be performed at the Week 24 visit. The biopsies will be read centrally . 6.7.1.4. Pharmacodynamics Sample Collection Blood samples for the pharm acodynamic analysis of serum LH, FSH , estradiol, and progesterone will be collected pre -dose at the visits indicated in the study Schedule of Activities in the protocol synopsis ( see Section 1.1 ). These pharmacodynamic samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory. For PK analysis of estradiol, a separate PK sample will be obtained to be analyzed at a PK laboratory (see Section 6.7.1.5) . To maintain blinding, concentrations of these hormones will be reported to the investigator, other vendors, and sponsor personnel only a fter database lock and unblinding. 6.7.1.5. Pharmacokinetics Sample Collection Blood samples for PK analysis of relugolix, estradiol, and norethindrone will be c ollected pre - dose at the visits indicated in the study Schedule of Activities in the protocol synopsis ( see Section 1.1 ). The actual date and time of each blood sample collection will be recorded. Patients will be instructed to hold their dose of study drug on clinic visit days and record the time of their previous dose (ie, the time they took their dose on the day before the clinic visit). If the study patient inadvertently took drug at home on the morning of the clinic visit, the dosing history should be accurately recorded and a PK sample collected ( which may be used for population PK modeling). To maintain blinding, PK concentrations will be reported to the sponsor in a blinded fashion, or only after database lock and unblinding.

Plasma and serum analysis will be performed by the sponsor (or designee). Plasma concentrations of relugolix and norethindrone and serum co ncentrations of estradiol will be determined in samples using a validated bioanalytical methodology. Raw data will be archived at the bioanalytical site. Once a sample has been analyzed for relugolix, estradiol, or norethindrone, any remaining plasma may be anal yzed for other compound- related metabolites and the results reported under a separate protocol. 6.7.1.6. Patient Diary All women enrolled in the study will be provided with a device with an application for a patient eDiary, along with detailed instruction s for its use . Patients will complete daily eDiaries including compliance with study treatment , menstrual bleeding, use of feminine products, uterine fibroid -associated pain , and use of pain medication (analgesics) to treat uterine fibroid pain (see Appendix 2) . Queries will be handled by the vendor managing the eDiary data through the clinical site. The eDiary data will be reviewed by the investigator to identify any potential adverse events. Patients will also receive a paper diary to enter information on menstruation status and feminine product use starting with Screening 1 visit and ending when they receive their eD iary at the Screening 3 visit. 6.7.1.7. Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire The Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire (MIQ) was designed to measure a women’s self - assessment of menstrual blood loss and its impact on her social and leisure activities, physical activities , and ability to work (see Appendix 3) . The MIQ has undergone psychometric validation. Patients will complete the MIQ at each study visit during the randomized treatment period . Patients will complete the MIQ at each visit at the site before other study procedures, such as blood draws and physical examinations, are performed. 6.7.1.8. Uterine Fibroid Symptom – Quality of Life The Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Health- Related Quality o f Life (UFS -QoL) score is used to evaluate the symptom severity and the quality of life of patients with uterine fibroids (see Appendix 4). Patien ts will complete the UFS -QoL questionnaire at the site at the Baseline Day 1 visit, Week 12 visit, and Week 24 visit before other study procedures , such as blood draws and physical examinations, are performed. 6.7.1.9. European Quality of Life Five -Dimension Five-Level Scale The European Quality of Life Five-Dimension Five -Level Scale (EQ -5D) is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcomes (see Appendix 5 ). Mobility, self- care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/de pression are each assessed on 3 -point categorical scales ranging from “no problem” to “severe problem.” MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1.

After the Follow-up visit, additional follow- up fo r the status of menstruation recovery will not be continued, 6.7.1.11. Pharmacogenomic s Sample Collection For possible exploratory investigation of markers enabling the prediction of drug response, one sample of blood will be collected and stored for future pharmaco genomic analyse s. All patients will be eligible for collection of the pharmacogenomic sample, however, the sample may only be obtained and stored from patien ts who provide a separate informed consent form for pharmacogenomic sample collection. Patien t participation in the pharmacogenomic research is voluntary and refusal to participate will not preclude entry into the study or indicate withdrawal from the study. If possible, the pharmacogenomic sample should be drawn from consented patien ts at the Baseline Day 1 visit, but it may be drawn at any time during the study through Week 24 (inclusive). Patients can request their sample to be destroyed at any time. A pharmacogenomic sample should not be collected from any patient who has received comparable bone marrow transplant or whole blood transfusion within 6 months before sample collection. Refer to the Study Reference Manual for directions on collecting, handling, and storage of pharmacogenomic samples. 6.7.2. Safety -Related Procedures 6.7.2.1.

ECGs will be mea sured using standardized equipment provided by central core laboratory with the patient in a semi -supine or supine position after 5 minutes of rest. The ECGs will be assessed by central review and a report provided to the site. The investigator or sub- investigator (or a qualified individual at the investigational site) will interpret the ECG report provided by the central reviewer using one of the following categories: normal or abnormal. The investigator or sub- investigator will judge if any of the findings are clinically significant. 6.7.2.6. Bone Mineral Density Bone mineral density is determined using DXA scanning and will be assessed at the lumbar spine (L1, L2, L3 and L4), total hip, and femoral neck (same leg within each patien t). Training, quality revi ew, and readings will be done by a central radiology laboratory as described in the central radiology charter for bone mineral density. The following will be assessed at each time point indicated for bone densitometry in the study Schedule of Activities ( Section 1.1 ): bone mineral content (g), bone area (area, cm2), and bone mineral density (g/cm2) each for L1, L2, L3, L4, total hip, and femoral neck, average bone mineral density of L1 -L4, and T- score for average of L1 -L4, total hip, and femoral neck. Throughout the study, the same DXA apparatus will used at each site and operated in the same scan mode for all scans for an individual patien t. A central core imaging laboratory will collect and evaluate all DXA scans for acceptability, and will have bone mineral density assessed as per the imaging charter . Data from the DXA scan s will be managed and analyzed separately by the core lab oratory and integrated into the study’s database at the end of the study. Bone mineral density changes for individual subject will be monitored by a central radiology laboratory over the course of the study. Investigators will be notified if a patient experiences a bone mineral density loss from baseline of 7% or more at any of the sties assessed during the study. In this case, repeat scan may be required for confirmation of the results, and it is at the investigator’s discretion to consider the patient’s status and determine future management.

SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS Study assessments of safety include adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs (and weight), ECGs, bone mineral density as sessments, endometrial biopsy results, and clinical laboratory tests . 7.1. Adverse Event Definitions 7.1.1. Adverse Event Adverse event: An adverse event is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not related to the medicinal product. Events meeting the definition of an adverse event include : • A worsening, excluding minor fluctuations, in the nature, severity, frequency, or duration of a pre-existing condition; • Development of an intercurrent illness during the study; • Development of symptoms that may or may not be related to the use of a concomitant medication or investigational product; • Injury or accidents: If a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or accident, the medical condition and the accident should be reported as 2 separate medical events (eg, for a fall secondary to dizziness, both “dizziness” and “fall” should be recorded separately) ; and • An inve stigational abnormality (eg, laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG) only if the abnormality is considered clinically significant by the investigator based on at least one of the following criteria: o Induces clinical signs or symptoms; o Requires active interv ention ; o Requires interruption or discontinuation of study drug. Events that do not meet the definition of an adverse event include: • Medical or surgical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an adverse event ; • Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected before the start of study drug administration that do not worsen; • Situations where an untoward medical event has not occurred (eg, planned hospitalization for an electiv e procedure, with elective defined as known or planned at the time of signing of the informed consent).

215,page_215,"Clinical Study Protocol: MVT-601-3001 Amendment 1, Effective: 08-FEB -2017 Myovant Sciences GmbH 68 CONFIDENTIAL Adverse events that occur during the study should be evaluated by the i nvestigator and graded according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event s (CTCAE). Episodic adverse events, such as vomiting, or those that occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive days are ‘intermittent’. All other events are ‘continuous’. Additional information on detecting, documenting, and reporting adverse events and serious adverse events are provided below. No toxicity -related dose reductions of study drug are permitted , however, study drug can be held for a period of up to 2 weeks for evaluation and treatment of an adverse event. The study drug may be restarted if deemed safe for the patient by the investigator. 7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a. Results in death ; b. Is life -threatening; NOTE: The term “life -threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the study participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. For example, drug-induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered life-threatening even though drug- induced hepatitis can be fatal . c. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the pa tient has been detained at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out-patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are adverse event s. If a com plication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the adverse event should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatme nt of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an adverse event . d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ; NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere or pre vent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; f. Important medical events which jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Adverse Event Reporting The reporting of serious adverse events by the s ponsor (Myovant Sciences GmbH ) to regulatory authorities is a requirement and each authority has a timetable for reporting these events based upon established criteria. Like wise, i t is the responsibility of the investigator to report serious adverse events to their local Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC). Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse event s and/or serio us adverse events. Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the patien t is the preferred method to inquire about adverse event occurrence. Appropriate questions include: • “How are you feeling?” • “Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/contact?” • “Have you taken any new medicines, other than those provided in this study, since your last visit/contact? The patient ’s eDiary entries and answers to the UFS -QoL will not be used as a primary means to collect adverse event s, however they should be reviewed by the study site personnel and the study monitors. Should the investigator or site staff become aware of a potential adverse event through the information collected with these instruments, proper follow-up with the patien t for medical evaluation should be undertaken. Through this follow- up, if it is determined that an adverse event not previously reported has been identified, normal reporting requirements should be applied. All patients who experience an adverse event will be evaluated at appropriate time intervals until the event resolves or has stabilized or become chronic. At the conclusion of the study, the investigator and m edical monitor will assess unresolved adverse events and determine if additional follow- up is warranted . All adverse events, whether or not related to the study drug treatment, must be fully and completely documented on the adverse event case report form and in the patient’s source documents. In addition, any adverse event resulting in permanent treatment discontinuation must be recorded on the appropriate case report form as well as documented in the patient’s source documents. Adverse event terms should include a diagnosis, as available, in preference to listing the individual signs and symptoms. If the diagnosis is not known, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as an individual adverse event. Overdose and pregnancy in the patient will be reported as described in Section 7.7 and Section 7.8, respectively. 7.2.1. Adverse Event Reporting Period Adverse events will be collected from the time the first dose of study drug is administered until the Follow-up visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug or the date of initiation of another investigational agent or hormonal therapy affecting the hypothalamic-pituitary -gonadal axis or surgical intervention for uterine fibroids , whichever occurs first , as also specified in the study Schedule of Activities ( Section 1.1 ). Study procedure- related adverse events will be collected from the signing of the informed consent form. MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 216"

Serious adverse events reported to the investigator after the safety reporting period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator assesses the event as related to the study drug treatment. With the exception of adverse events that are considered related to study screening procedures, (which are to be recorded as adverse events), events occurring between sig ning of the informed consent form and the first dose of study drug will be recorded as medical history and in the patient’s clinical record for any patient who continues to meet eligibility criteria and proceeds to dosing with study drug. Reporting instruc tions for serious adverse events are provided in Section 7.6 . 7.3. Assigning Causal Relationship to Study Drug The reasonable possibility of the relationship of an adverse event to study drug(s) is to be assessed with careful medical consideration at the time of evaluation of an adverse event. The following definitions are to be used for the relationship of the adverse event to study drug: • Probably rela ted: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and that follows a clinically reasonable response on readmi nistration (rechallenge) or withdrawal (dechallenge). • Possibly related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug but that could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. • Not related : A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to drug administration that makes a causal relationship improbable and/or in which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide a plausible explanation. All adverse events, whether or not related to study drug, must be fully and completely documented on the adverse event page of the eCRF and in the patient’s clinical recor d. In the event a patient is withdrawn from the study because of an adverse event, it must be recorded on the eCRF as such. 7.4. Assigning Severity Rating for Adverse Events Severity describes the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action taken . The investigator must determine the severity of each adverse event according to the National Cancer Institute CTCAE. For terms not specified with the CTCAE, the criteria in Table 7-1 should be used to determine the grade severity. MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 217"

Adverse Events of Clinical Interest Reporting Adverse events of clinical interest in this study are defined as any increase in ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN. Any ALT or AST elevation of this degree or greater occurring during the randomized t reatment period or the Follow-up visit should be reported to the sponsor using the Serious Adverse Event Form within 24 hours of the study site personnel ’s knowledge of the even t (see Section 7.6 ), even if the event does not meet SAE criteria . Additional instructions for evaluating patients with an increase in ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN may be found in Appendix 6. 7.5.1.

All clinical study document ation must be retained by the i nvestigator until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region (ie, United States, Europe, or Japan) and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region; or, if no application is filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until 2 year s after the investigation is discontin ued and regulatory authorities have been notified. Investigators may be required to retain documents longer if required by applicable regulatory requirements, by local regulations, or by an agreement with the s ponsor. The investigator must notify the s ponsor before destroying any clinical study records. Clinical study documentation includes the IB, signed protocol and amendments, signed informed consents, notification of serious adverse events and related reports, any dispensing and accountability logs, shipping records of investigational product and study- related materials, documentation of financial aspects of the study, insurance statement, and signed agreement between the involved parties, dated and documented IRB/IEC approval, approval of regulatory authorities as applicable, decoding procedures for blinded studie s, curriculum vitae and all training records of study site personnel, and all correspondence pertaining to the conduct of the study. Should the investigator wish to assign the study records to another party or move them to another location, the sponsor must be notified in advance. If the investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement at the study site for any or all of the documents, special arrangements must be made between the inves tigator and the sponsor to store these in sealed containers outside of the site so that they can be returned sealed to the investigator in case of a regulatory audit. When source documents are required for the continued care of the patient , appropriate copies should be made for storage outside of the site. 10.1.7. Electronic Case Report Forms For each patien t enrolled, an eCRF must be completed and signed by the i nvestigator or sub-investigator (as appropriate) listed on the 1572 and/or other appropriate local health authority documents within a reasonable time period after data collection. This also applies to records for those patien ts who fail to complete the study (even during a pre-randomization screening period if an eCRF was initiated). If a patien t withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the eCRF. If a patien t is withdrawn from the study because of a treatment- limiting adverse event, thorough efforts should be made to clearly document the outcome. 10.1.8. Investigational Product Accountability The investigator or investigator’s designee (ie, pharmacist) is responsible for ensuring adequate accountability (including dates and lot numbers) of all used and unused study drug (active and MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1.

This includes acknowledgment of receipt of each shipment of study product (quantity and condition), patien t dispensing records, and returned or destroyed study product. Dispensing records will document quantities received from the sponsor and quantities dispensed to patien ts, including lot number, date dispensed, Patient Identification Number, and the initials of the person dispensing the medication. At study initiation, the study monitor will evaluate the site’s standard operating procedure for investigational medicinal product disposal/destruction in order to ensure that it complies with the sponsor requirements. Drug may be returned or destroyed on an ongoing basis during the study if appropriate. At the end of the study, following final drug inventory reconciliation by the monitor, the study site will dispose of and/or destroy all unused study drug supplies, including empty containers, according to these procedures. If the site cannot meet the sponsor’s requirements for dispos al, arrangements will be made between the site and the sponsor (or designee) for destruction or return of unused investigational medicinal product supplies. All drug supplies and associated documentation will be periodically reviewed and verified by the study monitor over the course of the study. 10.1.9. Inspections The investigator should understand that source documents for this study should be made available to appropriately qualified personnel from the sponsor or its representatives, to IRBs or IECs, or to regulatory authority or health authority inspectors. 10.1.10. Protocol Compliance The investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the procedures and evaluations described in this protocol. 10.2. Sponsor Responsibilities 10.2.1. Protocol Modifications Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to patients , may be made only by the sponsor. All protocol modifications must be submitted to the IRB or IEC in accordance with local requirements. Approval must be obta ined before changes can be implemented. The investigator must not deviate from the protocol without first obtaining approval from the sponsor and the IRB or IEC, if required. In medical emergencies, the investigator will use medical judgment and will rem ove the patient from immediate hazard, then notify the sponsor (or designee) and the IRB or IEC immediately regarding the type of emergency and the course of action taken. The investigator must notify the sponsor (or designee) of any inadvertent protocol deviations upon their discovery, and document the deviations appropriately in the study files. When a protocol amendment substantially alters the study design or the potential risks or burden to patients, the informed consent form will be amended and approved by the IRB or IEC, and all patients on treatment will again provide informed consent.

Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Objectives • To evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic effects of 24 weeks of relugolix 40 mg once daily when co-administered with either 12 or 24 weeks of low-dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate Exploratory Objectives • To determine the benefit of 24 weeks of relugolix 40 mg once daily co- administered with either 12 or 24 weeks of low-dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate compared with placebo on patient-reported quality of life outcome measures. Study Design This study is an international phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled efficacy and safety study to evaluate 24 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with low-dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate and 12 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily followed by 12 weeks of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily co-administered with low-dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate compared with 24 weeks of placebo. Approximately 390 women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids will be enrolled and randomized 1:1:1 to the relugolix plus low-dose hormonal add-back therapy group (Group A; N ≈ 130), the relugolix monotherapy followed by co- administration with low-dose hormonal add-back therapy group (Group B; N ≈ 130), or placebo group (Group C; N ≈ 130). Stratification variables will include: geographic region (North America versus Rest of World) and mean screening menstrual blood loss volume (< 225 mL versus ≥ 225 mL) by the alkaline hematin method. The study consists of a screening period (~11 weeks), a randomized treatment period (24 weeks), and a follow -up period (~30 days). Additionally, unscheduled follow-up visit(s) may be arranged for patients with study-related safety concerns as needed. A diagnosis of uterine fibroids will be confirmed during the screening period by centrally-reviewed transvaginal and/or transabdominal ultrasound. Heavy menstrual bleeding will be defined as menstrual blood loss of ≥ 80 mL each cycle for 2 cycles during the screening period. During the randomized treatment period, study participants will take blinded study treatment orally once daily for 24 weeks. Women with iron-deficient microcytic anemia and hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL and ≤ 10 g/dL at Screening must be treated with oral or parenteral iron replacement therapy. Between the Baseline Day 1 and Week 24 visits, patients will attend visits monthly (ie, every 4 weeks). At the Screening , Week 12, and Week 24 visits, patients will have an assessment of bone mineral density with dual -energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA). A n endometrial biopsy will also be performed at Screening . A transvaginal and/or transabdominal ultrasound will be performed at Week 24, followed by a repeat endometrial biopsy. Patients will have paired baseline and end-of-treatment endometrial biopsies, independent of ultrasound results. Feminine products will be standardized and will be collected and assessed for blood loss by the alkaline hematin method. Complete blood counts and chemistries will be collected monthly and uterine and uterine fibroid volume s will be asses sed at the Screening and Week 24 visits .

Quality of life questionnaires will be completed according to the Schedule of Activities. Safety will be assessed throughout the study by monitoring adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations including visual acuity, clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiograms, endometrial biopsies , and assessments of bone mineral density. Height will be measured at the Screening 1 visit and weight will be measured at specified intervals. Samples will be colle cted for PK assessment of relugolix, estradiol, and norethindrone and for the pharmacodynamic assessment of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) , estradiol, and progesterone. All patients completing the Week 24 visit, i ncluding women randomized to placebo, will be offered the opportunity to enroll in an open-label extension study in which all eligible patients will receive relugolix co -administered with low-dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate. Patients who do not enroll into the extension study will have a follow -up visit approximately 30 days after the end of treatment (ie, after the patient’s last dose of study medication).

Statistical Methods Efficacy The efficacy analyses will be conducted using an Intent-to-T reat (ITT) P opulation defined as all randomized patients, unless otherwise specified in the statistical analysis plan. Randomization will be 1:1:1 with the stratification variables of geographic region and mean screening menstrual blood loss volume (mL per alkaline hematin method) as follows: • Geographic Region: North America versus Rest of World; • Mean screening menstrual blood l oss volume: < 225 mL versus ≥ 225 mL. The randomization stratification factors will be incorporated into inferential testing of all efficacy endpoints, unless otherwi se specified. The primary hypothesis tested in this study is whether relugolix co-administered wi th 1.0 mg estradiol and 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate is superior to placebo in the percentage of women who achieve both a menstrual blood loss volume of < 80 mL AND at least a 50% reduction in menstrual blood loss volume over the last 35 days on treatment as compared with Baseline . The point estimate and 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the difference in the proportion will be c alcula ted between the relugolix Group A and placebo Group C.

Comparisons between the two relugolix arms will be descriptive. A closed testing procedure will be used to control the overall type I error rate of 5% across primary and secondary endpoint testi ng. Details of this procedure will be provided in the statistical analysis plan. Sample Size Assuming a placebo control response rate of 25%, the assessment of the superiority of relugolix 40 mg co-administered wi th low-dose hormonal add-back therapy (Group A) versus placebo (Group C) in the proportion of patients who achieve both a menstrual blood loss volume of < 80 mL AND at least a 50% reduction in menstrual blood loss volume over the last 35 days of treatment, a sample size of 260 (130 patients in each of the relugolix and placebo arms) will provide > 99% power to detect a difference of greater than 30 percentage points using a 2-sided test at significance level of 0.05. The total sample size for the study will be approximately 390 patients (130 patients in each of the 3 arms). Safety Safety assessments will include treatment-emergent adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiograms, endometrial biopsies, and assessments of bone mineral density. Safety analyses will be based on all randomized patients who receive any amount of study drug (safety population). Drug exposure will be summarized by descriptive statistics. Severity of all treatment-emergent adverse events will be evaluated by the investigator based on the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0 and will be coded to preferred term, higher level term, and system organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).

Uterine Fibroids with Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Uterine leiomyomas (often referred to as fibroids or myomas) are common benign, estrogen - dependent tumors that grow in the muscular wall of the uterus and occur in approximately 25% of women of reproductive age . While the majority of uterine fibroids are asymptomatic, approximately 25% of women with fibroids develop symptoms requiring treatment. T he most problematic symptom for women with uterine fibroids is heavy menstrual bleeding, with menstrual periods of increased duration and volume. In women with uterine fibroids, menstrual periods can last as long as 10 to 14 days rather than the usual 5 to 7 days , and blood loss can be as high as 300 to 500 mL , with anything more than 80 mL during a given cycle considered abnormal. The heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids is likely caused by the increase in surface area of the uterine cavity, poor uterine contraction due to the myoma, and increased circulation, congestion, or impaired hemostasis due to hypertrophy of the endometrium near the myoma [Hapangama, 2016]. Persistent heavy m enstrual bleeding can induce iron- deficiency anemia and associated fatigue and loss of energy. Heavy menstrual bleeding is a primary reason for the deteriorat ion in the health -related quality of life assessed in patients with uterine fibroids and is a major cause of elective hysterectomy. Other symptoms include bulk symptoms , such as pain or pressure in the abdomen and pelvis due to large myo ma(s) , low back pain, urinary frequency or urinary tract obstruction , constipation, and pregnancy loss . The incidence of uterine fibroids increases as women grow older, and risk factors include nulliparit y, obesity, family history, black race , and hypertension. Fibroids typically arise during the reproductive year s, tend to enlarge during pregnancy and regress after menopause as these tumors are dependent upon estrogen and progesterone for their growth . Transvaginal ultrasound is used most commonly to diagnose these benign tumors, and magnetic resonance imaging, sonohysterography, and hysteroscopy are used to evaluate their size and position. The type of treatment recommended for uterine fibroids typical ly depends upon their size, location, the patient’s age, reproductive plans , and obstetrical history. Few medical options are available for women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and approximately 60% of women who received medical therapy in one study underwent a surgical procedure within 2 year s [Marjoribanks , 2006], suggesting many w omen are inadequately treated with the currently available medical therapies. Combined hormonal contraceptives and progestational agents are commonly prescribed to regulate abnormal uterine bleeding, but appear to have limited efficacy in the treatment of uterine fibroids [ Carr, 1993]. Although no randomized studie s evaluating the use of levonorgestrel- releasing intrauterine system devices for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding related to uterine fibroids have b een conducted, observational studies have reported a reduction in uterine volume and bleeding and this system is approved for use by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists such as leupro lide acetate (also known as leuprorelin) are effective in lowering estrogen and progesterone levels, decreasing menstrual bleeding, and decreasing fibroid size, however they cannot be used for more than 6 months due to bone mineral density loss from the resulting hypoestrogenic state. The GnRH agonists, which MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 276"

This initial rise in hormonal levels is followed by a gradual decline in levels over 4 weeks as the pituitary becomes desensitized to the chronic stimulation of the GnRH agonist and LH and FSH level s fall. Other medical treatments are used but have limited clinical effectiveness, including tranexamic acid, aromatase inhibitors , non -steroidal anti -inflammatory medications, and danazol. The current mainstay of treatment for women with heavy menstrual bleedin g associ ated with uterine fibroids is surgery. Several surgical procedures are frequently performed including myomectomy by various techniques, endometrial ablation, endometrial uterine artery embolization, and magnetic resonance- guided focused -ultrasound surgery. Each of these procedures has complications. For example, abdominal myomectomy result s in complications requiring hysterectomy in up to 3 to 4% of cases , along with the frequent development of intraoperative adhesions [Gliklich , 2011]. Furthermore, recurrence after myomectomy is common with at least 25 % of women requiring additional treatment [Stewart , 2015, Marret , 2012, ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 96 , 2008]. Hysterectomy is the definitive procedure and more than 250,000 hysterectomies are performed in the US for uterine fibroids. Major complications have been reported to occur in up to 25% of women undergoing hysterectomy, including infection, severe bleeding, and in juries to the urethra, bowel or bladder. One study showed that among women with Medicaid insurance who underwent abdominal hysterectomy, there was a 10% risk of transfusion and up to a 28% risk of medical or surgical complications including major blood loss, wound infection and febrile episodes [ Gliklich , 2011]. Approximately 3 million women in the United States suffer from symptomatic uterine fibroids that are inadequately treated with medical therapy , and related US health care costs for uterine fibroids exceeds $34 billion [ Stewart , 2015; Cardozo, 2012, Gliklich , 2011]. There is a great need for a medicine that can decrease the symptoms of uterine fibroids and can be safely administered so that women have an option other than surgical procedures such as myomecto my and hysterectom y. 2.2. Relugolix 2.2.1. Indication Relugolix co-adminis tered wi th low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate is being developed as a once daily oral medication for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibr oids. The proposed dose of relugolix is 40 mg administered orally once daily and the proposed doses of estradiol and norethindrone acetate are 1 mg and 0.5 mg once daily, respectively . 2.2.2. Pharmacol ogy Relugolix (also known as TAK -385) is an orally -active, potent, highly- selective high- affinity small molecule GnRH receptor antagonist with a novel structure. Relugolix was discovered and initially studied by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, Limited, before development rights outside of Japan and certain East As ian countries were licensed to Myovant Sciences GmbH .

278,page_278,"Clinical Study Protocol: MVT -601-3001 Effective: 10-NOV-2016 Myovant Sciences GmbH 27 CONFIDENTIAL Relugolix antagonizes the human GnRH receptors present on the gonadotroph in-secreting cells of the anterior pituitary by competitively inhibiting binding of the active ligand, GnRH, to the GnRH receptor s. In the absence of GnRH -stimulated secretion by the anterior pituitary, levels of LH and FSH f all rapidly , followed by a decline over a few days in estradiol and progesterone levels . Relugolix acts as a potent and highly selective antagonist for the human GnRH receptor . The affinity of relugolix for the human GnRH receptor in vitro was approximately 50- fold higher than that of GnRH in the presence of prote in (40% fetal bovine serum). Transgenic knock- in mice expressing the human GnRH receptor treated with relugolix had substantial reductions in reproductive organ weights of both female and male mice, suggesting that relugolix may suppress blood estrogen and testosterone levels, respectively. Orally administered relugolix suppressed the hypothalamic -pituitary axis in castrated cynomolgus monkeys at doses of 1 mg /kg and higher. 2.2.3. Nonclin ical Toxicology A comprehensive package of nonclinical studies has been conducted to evaluate the toxicity of relugol ix. These include repeat -dose toxicity studies in mice of up to 13 weeks, in rats of up to 26 weeks, and in monkeys of up to 39 weeks. Oral administration of relugolix resulted in reversible liver toxicity (liver enzyme elevations with and without accompanying histopathological correlates) and changes related to reversible phospholipidosis (PLD) in several tissues/organs, most notably the lymph nodes, lungs, and testes in rats; and lymph nodes, parietal cells in the stomach, spleen, and intestines in monkeys. P LD by itself is not adverse, and no significant adverse effects were associated with PLD in rats and monkeys except at doses that caused mortality in rats (≥ 1000 mg /kg/day), which were associated with extremely high systemic exposures. The no -observed- effect level (NOEL) for liver findings in the 39 -week monkey toxicity study was 5 mg/kg/day, and the no -observed-adverse- effect level (NOAEL) is considered to be 15 mg /kg/day. The gender combined mean end of study area under the concentration -time curve from time 0 to 24 hours ( AUC 0-24) at the NOAEL of 15 mg /kg/day was 5.2 μg⋅hr/mL, which is ~51 times higher than the estimated exposure (AUC) in women receiving 40 mg once daily (0.101 μg ⋅hr/mL), the dose of relugolix to be administered in this study. Both the liver and PLD findings demonstrated evidence of reversibility following a 13-week recovery period in monkeys. No evidence of PLD has been observed in clinical studies. The relugolix toxicology program supports the conduct of clinical studies up to the NOAEL (15 mg /kg/day) exposure (5.2 μg ⋅hr/mL) fo r liver toxicity in monkeys (most sensitive species). Relugolix is not mutagenic or clastogenic and was not carcinogenic in 2 -year mou se and rat studies. Embryo- fetal death was observed only in relugolix -treated pregnant rabbits, but no fetal malformation was observed in rat and rabbit embryo- fetal development studies. While relugolix demonstrated phototoxic potential in an in vitro 3T3 neutral red uptake assay, in vivo data did not show phototoxicity in hairless mice, and no damage to the eye structure o r function was evident in the 4 - and 39- week monkey toxicity studies. Prolongation of the corrected QT interval was observed in a study of cynomolgus monkeys at ≥100 mg /kg (estimated C max of 4.0 µg/mL), but did not prolong the QT interval in a human thoro ugh QT study at doses up to 360 mg (C max of 0.181 µg/mL).

Previous Human Experience Nine phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers and three p hase 2 studies (including one in women with uterine fibroids and two in women with endometriosis ) have been completed. In addition, six clinical studie s evaluating relugolix are ongoing, including two phase 1 studies, two phase 2 studies in men with prostate cancer (US and Europe) , and two phase 3 studies in women with uterine fibroids in Japan. Mor e than 13 80 patients and healthy volunteers have received at least one dose of relugolix , including 158 women receiving relugolix 40 mg once daily (the propose d phase 3 dose) for at least 28 days and at least 200 men receiving relugolix at doses of 80 mg or 120 mg once daily for at least 24 weeks and for as long as 48 weeks . Eighty- eight women have been treated with rel ugolix 40 mg once daily for 24 weeks. 2.2.4.1. Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics, and Metabolism Data from phase 1 studies demonstrate that relugolix treatment results in rapid, dose-dependent suppression of estradiol in female subjects and testosterone in male subjects. After oral administration, the absolute bioavailability of relugolix was 12% (range 6 to 25%) with a predominant elimination half-life of 37 to 42 hours. In a human radiolabeled study, there were no major circulating metabolites of relugolix. The primary route of elimination of drug -related material was in the feces. The pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics of relugolix have been evaluated, and appear to be similar in American and Japanese volunteers, despite the lower mean body mass index observed in Japanese volunteers. A phase 1 study ( TAK-385_101) in healthy US premenopausal women de monstrated the tolerability of single doses of relugolix 1 to 80 mg , and once-daily dosing of relugolix at 10, 20, and 40 mg for 2 weeks. Plasma concentrations of relugolix increased in a slightly greater than dose- proportional manner. Suppression of serum estradiol was similar after single doses of 40 or 80 mg once daily relugolix. The serum concentrations of LH, FSH, estradiol , and progesterone rapidly decreased and remained at low levels with multiple doses of relugolix with the majority of women having estradiol levels < 10 pg/mL in the 40-mg dose group. Based on these hormone reductions, oral relugolix 40 mg once daily was chosen as the high dose for further study in phase 2. A 6-week phase 1 st udy (MVT -601- 1001) in h ealthy US premenopausal women was conducted to evaluate the safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics profile of oral relugolix 40 mg once daily and relugolix 40 mg once daily in combination with estradiol/norethindrone acetate (1 mg/0.5 mg once daily ). Median pre -dose trough concentrations in the relugolix alone arm were ~6 pg/mL; with the addition of 1 mg estradiol once daily, these were increased to ~26 pg/mL, and median peak concentrations were ~45 pg/mL . This trough and peak concentration range is consistent with the estradiol range associated with reduced loss of bone mineral density [ Barbieri , 1992]. Relugoli x PK and norethindrone acetate PK w ere similar to historic data. The estrogenic metabolite of norethindrone, ethinyl estradiol, was below the limit of quantitation in almost all PK samples collected. The adverse event profile was similar to prior phase 1 studies , with a marked reduction in hot flu shes noted in the relugolix plus hormonal add -back therapy in comparison with the relugolix alone arm. Relugolix is to be administered in the fasted state, as food decreases the extent of relugolix absorption (AUC) by approximately 45%. The exposure of relugolix is increased by inhibitors MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 279"

Clinical Studies in Women with Uterine Fibroids or Endometriosis and Men with Prostate Cancer A phase 2 study (TAK -385/CCT- 001) evaluated the efficacy, safety, PK, and pharmacodynamics of relugolix 10, 20, and 40 mg once daily for 12 weeks in 216 Japanese women with uterine fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding . Heavy menstrual bleeding was defined for enrollment into the study as a score on the Pictorial Blood Loss Assessment Chart (PBAC) of at least 120 ; uterine fibroids were confirmed by ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging , computed tomography , or laparoscopy. For the primary endpoint (proportion of patients with a total PBAC score of < 10 from Week 6 to 12), statistically significant dose-dependent differences were observed in all relugolix treatment groups compared to placebo (Figure 2-1). The proportion was highe r in the relugolix 40 mg group (83.6%) compared with 0% in the p lacebo group (p < 0.0001). In the relugolix 20 mg group, 43.6% of women responded and in the 10 mg group 20.8% responded, demonstrating a dose- response relationship. O f the women in the relugolix 40 mg group, 72.7% achieved amenorrhea from Week 6 to Week 12. Similarly, improvement with increasing dose was also observed in the secondary endpoints including change in myoma and uterine volumes and blood concentration of hemoglobin.

With the exception of the incidence of nasopharyngitis in all treatm ent groups, these common adverse events were thought to be caused by the pharmacological effect of relugolix. The adverse events associated with menstruation were pri marily reported in the first 28 days . Most of the adverse events were mild or moderate, and no serious treatment -emergent adverse event considered related to study drug w as observed. Adverse events resulted in study drug discontinuation in 2 patients (hemoglobin decreased in a placebo patient and tinnitus, libido decreased, menopausal depres sion and hyperhidrosis in one patient treated with relugolix 20 mg once daily ). Bone mineral density decreases appeared to correlate with increasing doses of relugolix . Women treated with placebo for 12 weeks had a mild loss of bone mineral density (mean ± standard deviation [ SD]) of -0.24 ± 2.218% compared with -0.75 ± 2.350%, -2.01 ± 2.334%, and -2.28 ± 2.194% in the relugolix 10, 20, and 40 mg once daily group s, respec tively . One patient had a positive pregnancy test after receiving approximately 46 days of relugolix 10 mg once daily (a dose that does not fully suppress estradiol) . Study drug was discontinued. An ultrasound determined that the patient was 7 weeks pregnant. The patient subsequently had an uneventful pregnancy and delivered a healthy infa nt at 39 weeks. In a phase 2 study of women with endometriosis (TAK-385/CCT-101), 487 women were randomized to relugolix doses of 10, 20, or 40 mg or placebo , administ ered orally once daily over a 12-week period, or to leupro lide acetate ( every 4-week injection ) administered for 12 weeks. The study demonstrated dose- dependent decreases in pelvic pain as assessed by a 100 mm visual analogue score (VAS). The pain scores for pelvic pain were well -balanced across the groups at baseli ne and the means ranged from 14.6 to 15.6 mm. The changes from baseline in the VAS score (mean ± SD) were -10.418 ± 1 1.0171 mm in the relugolix 40 mg group vs. - 3.753 ± 10.5018 mm in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). All doses were better than placebo, with the greatest benefit observed at the highest dose evaluated, 40 mg once daily. The decrease in mean VAS pain score for the leupro lide group ( -10.460 ± 10.3013 mm ) was similar to that of the relugolix 40 mg group. The effects of relugolix on pain were maintained following an additional 12 weeks of treatment in the extension study (total of 24 weeks). Estradiol levels were suppressed for the duration of the study. In the 12-week phase 2 endom etriosis study (CCT -101) and the companion 12-week extension study ( OCT -101; total of 24 weeks of treatment), the safety p rofile of the relugolix 40 mg once daily dose was comparable to that of leuprolide treatment. The mo st commonly reported treatment -emergent adverse events in the relugolix groups than in the placebo group included hot flush, metrorrhagia, and menstruation irregular , and were considered to be due to the pharmacological effects of relugolix . The events of m enstrual bleeding were primarily reported in the first 28 days . Bone mineral density changes from baseline (mean ± standard deviation [SD] ) observed after 24 weeks of treatment were -0.23 ± 1.986% in the placebo group, -1.61 ± 2.338%, - 2.58 ± 2.936% , and -4.90 ± 2.912% in the relugolix 10, 20, and 40 mg groups respectively, and -4.43 ± 2.157% in the leupro lide group. Bone mineral density changes from baseline in the relugolix 40 mg group at 12 and 24 weeks were comparable to those in the leupro lide group for the same durations. Two patients had liver function test abnormalities considered study drug- related by the investigator and that resulted in discontinuation of study drug. MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1.

One study is assessing the effect of relugolix in women with moderate to severe pain associated with uterine fibroids, and the other is evaluating women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. Data from these ong oing studies are not available. Two phase 2 clinic al studie s of relugolix (C27002 and C27003) in men with advanced pros tate cancer requiring androgen deprivation therapy were initiated in North America in 2014. Study C27002, which remains ongoing, enrolle d patients with advanced prosta te cancer. In this open- label, parallel g roup study, men were randomized to receive oral relugolix at a dose of 80 mg or 120 mg once daily after a single oral loading dose of 320 mg (N = 50 in each arm) or to the GnRH agonis t therapy , leupro lide acetate, 22.5 mg administered s ubcutaneously every 12 weeks, (N = 25) for up to 48 weeks. Study C27003, in which the last clinical study visits have been completed, enrolled men in North America or the United Kingdom requiring six mo nths of androgen deprivation therapy as neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy to external beam radiation therapy. Patients were randomized to relugolix 120 mg once daily (after a single oral loading dose of 320 mg ) (N = 65) or to degarelix 80 mg subcutaneously every four weeks ( N = 38) for 24 weeks (after a single loading dose of 240 mg). Results from the C27002 interim analysis demonstrated that both doses of oral relugolix, 80 mg and 120 mg once daily , rapidly reduced testosterone levels below the castration threshold (≤50 ng/dL) and maintained these levels through at least 24 weeks. These data are comparable to testosterone levels achieved by leupro lide 22.5 mg every 3 months. Study C27003 demonstrated rapid and sustained suppression of testosterone levels for the 24 -week treatment duration. In an interim analysis of the phase 2 prost ate cancer study C27002, the most common treatment- emergent adverse events occurring in at least 10% of men with advanced prostate cancer in the relugolix 80 mg or 120 mg once daily arms or leupro lide arm included hot fl ush, alanine aminotransferase increase, fatigue, aspartate aminotransferase, diabetes mellitus, hyperhidrosis, muscle spasm, injection site reaction , and frequent daytime urination. The common adve rse events observed with relugolix in men with prostate cancer were generally consistent with its mechanism of action and those observed with leupro lide. A biomarker f or PLD, di-22:6- bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate (di-22:6- BMP ), was monitored in this study due to findings of PLD in nonclinical toxicity studies. There were no systematic increases in post -baseline serum or urinary di -22:6- BMP levels and no c hanges exceeding 2 -fold observed in any patient s. No clinical evidence of relugolix -related PLD- associated toxicity has been observed regarding the heart, liver, central nervous system, or muscle in any clinical study. Relugolix has been generally well tolerated. The s erious identified risk associated with relugolix treatment is loss of bone mineral density in women. Nonserious adverse events related to relugolix class effects include hot flush and headache in both sexes; reproductive system events (abnormal uterine bleeding, geni tal hemorrhage, menorrhagia or heavy menstrual bleedin g, menstruation irregular, and oligomenorrhea), arthralgia, and hyperhidrosis in women with uterine fibroids or endometriosis ; and vision blurred, hepatic enzyme increased, libido decreased, and anxiety in men.

The study co nsists of a screening period (~ 11 weeks), a randomized treatment period (24 weeks), and a follow-up period (~30 days). Additionally, unscheduled follow- up visit(s) may be arranged for patien ts with study -related safety concerns as needed . A diagnosis of uterine fibroids will be confirmed during the screening period by a centrally - reviewed transvaginal and/or transabdom inal ultrasound. Heavy menstrual bleeding will be defined as menstrual blood loss of ≥ 80 mL per cycle for each of 2 cycles during the screening period. During the randomized treatment period , study participants will take blinded study drug orally once d aily for 24 weeks. Women with iron- deficient microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin ≤ 10 g/dL at Screening must be treated with oral or parenteral iron replacement therapy . Between the Baseline and Week 24 visits, patients will attend visits monthly (ie, every MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 285"

At the Screening , Week 12, and Week 24 visits, patients will have an assessment of bone mineral density with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) . An endo metrial biopsy will also be performed at Screening . A transvaginal and/or transabdominal u ltrasound will be performed at Week 2 4, followed by a repeat endometrial biopsy. Feminine products will be standardized and will be collected and assessed for blood loss by the alkaline hematin method. Complete blood counts and chemistries will be collected monthly and uterine and uterine fibroid volumes will be assessed at the Screening and Week 24 visits . Patients will complete daily electronic diaries (eDiary) including compliance with study treatment , menstrual bleeding, use of feminine products for menstrual bleeding , uterine fibroid -associated pain by the Numerical Rating Scale, and use of pain medication to treat pain caused by uterine fibroids . Quality of life questionnaires will be completed according to the Schedule of Activities . Safety assess ments will include treatment -emergent adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations including visual acuity, clinical laboratory tests , 12-lead electrocardiogr ams, endometrial biopsies, and assessments of bone mineral density . Samples will also be collected for PK assessment of relugolix, estradiol, and norethindrone , and for the pharmacodynamic assessment of LH, FSH , estradiol, and progesterone. All patients completing the Week 24 visit, i ncluding women randomized to placebo, will be offered the opportunity to enroll in a n open- label extension study in which all eligible patients will receive relugolix co -administered with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate. Patients who do not enroll into the extension study will have a follow-up visit to assess safety approximately 30 days after the end of treatment (ie, after the patient’s last dose of study medication).

Discussion of Study Design, Including Dosing Rationale and Choice of Control Grou p This phase 3 study is one of two replicate studies designed to establish the efficacy and safety of relugolix 40 mg once daily in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. This study will focus on the primary objective of demonstrating a reduction in heavy menstrual bleeding, the most common and burdensome symptom of uterine fibroids. The study is designed to demonstrate the benefit and safety of relugolix co -administered with low -dose estradiol (1 mg) and norethindrone acetate (0.5 mg ) for 24 weeks. An additional relugolix arm dosed with 12 weeks of relugolix monotherapy 40 mg once daily followed by 12 weeks of relugolix 40 mg once daily co -administered with low -dose estradiol and norethindrone acetate will be used to provide an assessment of the requirement for the low-dose hormonal add-back therapy to mitigate the adverse effect s of relugolix monotherapy on bone mineral density loss and vasomotor symptoms . An extension study is planned to provide additional safety and efficacy data through 48 weeks . Women with uterine fibroids and heavy men strual blood loss by t he alkaline hematin method of ≥ 80 mL /cycle as assessed during two cycles will be enrolled in this study. Randomization will be 1:1:1 . Placebo was selected as the appropriate control for the study because there is no standard of care medical therapy for the long- term treatment of women with uterine fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding. Commo nly-used t reatment options range from combined oral contraceptive pills , which are not effective in many cases, levonorgestrel -containing intrauterine devices, and leupr olide therapy indicated for 3 month s in the preoperative setting. The dose of relugolix for phase 3 evaluati on is 40 mg once daily. This dose was selected for evaluation in phase 2 clinical studie s based upon phase 1 data demonstrat ing similar estrad iol and progesterone suppression in women treated wi th single doses of relugolix 40 mg or 80 mg , and data demonstrating that premenopausal women treated with multiple doses of 40 mg once daily relugolix over 14 days had estradiol levels suppressed to a median value of 3.68 pg/mL. Data from a phase 2 s tudy in women with endometr iosis demonstrated relugolix 40 mg once daily (N = 101) suppressed estradiol levels to below 20 pg/mL in the majority of women, and results were similar to those in the group of women treated with leupro lide subcutaneous injection, 3.75 mg . Women in both the relugolix 40 mg and the leupro lide groups had similar reductions in pelvic pain, the primary endpoint of the study. Finally, as described above, a phase 2 study of doses of relugolix 10, 20 and 40 mg once daily administered to women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids demonstrated the 40 mg dose provided the most reduction in menstrual blood loss and was the optimal dose to move forward int o phase 3 development based on efficacy data. However, data on bone mineral density from DXA scanning in both phase 2 studies of premenopausal women with endometriosis or uterine fibroids demonstrated relugolix 40 mg once daily resulted in a degree of bone mineral density loss that is only acceptable for short -term dosing. To mitigate this known adverse consequence of estrogen suppression, relugolix will be co-administered with 1 mg estradiol and 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate in this phase 3 clinical study. This low -dose hormonal therapy is currently approved for long- term use to prevent bone mineral density loss and vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women. Although relugolix doses of 20 mg and 10 mg once daily had less bone mineral density loss, these doses did not provide adequate relief from heavy menstrual bleeding in a high enough percentage of women to MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1.

The co -administration of hormonal a dd-back th erapy to relugolix aims to restore estradiol concentrations to a range that alleviates the adverse impact of the hypoestrogenic state on bone mineral density through 48 weeks of treatment, as well as on vasomotor symptoms such as hot flushes, but without substantial effect on the beneficial decrease in heavy menstrual bl ood loss. It is well known that bone is exquisitely sensitive to estrogen and low -doses of estrogen are sufficient to prevent bone mineral density loss in a hypoestrogenic state [ Barbieri , 1992]. The combinat ion of estradiol with a progestin is commonly used for long -term hormonal add- back therapy to reduce the risk of developing endometrial hyperplasia which can occur with unopposed estrogen therapy [ Activella US Prescribing Information , 2013]. A variety of add- back hor monal therapies have been evaluated in combination with GnRH agonists and antagonists over the last 20 year s [Archer , 2015; Chwalisz , 2012; Franke , 2000; Hornstein, 1998; Morris , 2008; Simpson , 1992; Wu , 2014; Zupi, 2004], and a combination of estradiol and norethi ndrone acetate has been used as add -back therapy in prior clinical studies with leupro lide (a GnRH agonist) and more recently, the GnRH antagonist elagolix, in each case reducing bone mineral density loss and the incidence of hot flushes without a significant impact on the decrease in menstrual blood loss [ Archer , 2015; Lee, 2016; Franke , 2000]. The est radiol/norethindrone acetate combination proposed for evaluatio n in this phase 3 study is currently approved in the US as long- term hormone replacement therapy to prevent bone loss and alleviate vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women [ Activella US Prescribing Informati on, 2013]. A 6-week study in healthy premenopausal women adm inistered oral relugolix 40 mg once daily alone or relugolix 40 mg once daily in combination with 1 mg estradiol and 0.5 mg norethindrone acetate has demonstrated that this dose of add -back therapy maintains serum estradiol in the 2 5-50 pg/mL range, the range historically shown to reduce loss of bone mineral density [ Barbieri , 1992] . Serum N- a nd C -telopeptide concentrations were also maintained at near baseline levels with the addition of the add -back therapy, suggesting reduced bone resorption compared to the group r eceiving relugolix alone. Hot flush rate was also considerably reduced with the addition of add- back therapy. The estrogenic metabolite of norethindrone acetate, ethinyl estradiol, was below the limit of quantitation in almost all PK samples collected , and therefore, will not be assessed in this phase 3 study. Th ese data also confirm that lower doses of estradiol/norethindrone acetate (such as the 0.5 mg/0.1 mg combination tablet; Activella US Pre scribing Inf ormation , 2013) would not provide sufficient serum estradiol concentrations to pro tect against the loss of bone mineral density resulting from the hypoestrogenic state induced by once daily administration of relugolix 40 mg. The doses of estradiol and norethindrone acetate used in this study (1 .0 mg and 0.5 mg, respectively) represent less than one fifth the estrogenic effects of an oral contraceptive pill containing 30 µg of ethi nyl estradiol. Therefore, this low -dose hormonal add- back therapy is added solely to improve the safety of relugolix therapy and is not included as a control arm as it is expected to have either a neutral or a marginal detrimental effect on efficacy, whil e mitigating the side effects of relugolix on bone mineral density loss and vasomotor symptoms . In summary, relugolix at a dose of 40 mg once daily resulted in a marked decrease in the heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in a majority of women in a well -designed large phase 2 study. H owever, its administration was associated with a degree of bone mineral MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 289"

This phase 3 study will primarily assess the efficacy and safety of relugolix 4 0 mg co-administered with a low -dose of estradiol and norethindrone acetate compared with placebo at 24 weeks to decrease heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and to prevent the bone mineral density loss and ameliorate some of the other side effects of a hypoestrogenic state such as hot flushes. An additional arm with monotherapy relugolix administer ed for 12 weeks followed by 12 weeks of relugolix co - administered with low-dose hormonal add- back therapy is included to provide data on the requirement for hormonal therapy to mitigate the adverse relugolix side effects of bone mineral density loss and hot flushes .

Blinding All patient s, investigators, and sponsor staff or representatives involved in the conduct of the study will be blinded to treatment assignment , with the exception of an unblinded statistician (s) who is responsible for developing the randomization codes and presenting unblinded data to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board if requested . The blind will be maintained during asse ssment of PK and pharmacodynamic testing; PK concentrations will be reported to the sponsor in a blinded fashion, or only after database lock and unblinding, or provisions will be made to provide data only to personnel approved for unblinding. Unblinding for a given patient will occur only if the knowledge of treatment assignment will materially change the planned management of a medical emergency. Investigators will have direct access to a given patient’s individual study treatment, however, t he Investiga tor should make every effort to first contact the medical monitor or appropriate study personnel to discuss options before unblinding the patient’s treatment assignment. If unblinding occurs before sponsor personnel can be consulted or notified, the Investigator must notify the sponsor as soon as possible after unblinding, but without revealing the treatment ass ignment of the unblinded patient , unless that information is im portant for the safety of pa tients currently in the study.

Study Procedures 6.7.1. Efficacy -Related Procedures 6.7.1.1. Menstrual Blood Loss as Assessed by the Alkaline Hematin Method The volume of menstrual blood loss is measured in milliliters using the alkaline hematin method [Hallberg , 1964]. The method involves pummeling used feminine products in a solution and measurin g the resulting hematin absorbance against calibration curves. The method is validated in accordance with current FDA Guidance for Method Validations and is an accepted quantit ative clinical endpoint for the assessment of heavy menstrual bleeding. The si te staff will provide collection kits with standardized and validated feminine products to patients for the collection and assessment of those products to determine menstrual bl ood loss . The feminine products will be dispensed and collected at each visit until the patient completes treatment or terminates participation from the study prior to completing treatment. Each time the patient submits her feminine products from a menstrual cycle for analysis, a venous blood sample will be collected and sent to the laboratory. Details regarding materials, process, and requirements for the menstrual blood loss collection will be provided in the Study Reference Manual . 6.7.1.2. Transvaginal and/ or Transabdominal Ultrasound Transvaginal and/ or transabdominal ultrasound with saline o r gel contrast is performed for the diagnosis of uterine fibroids, to determine uterine and myoma volumes , and to exclude any other uterine or pelvic pathology . To avoid inter- observer and inter -device variations, a single physician ( investigator or sub -investigator) will be assigned to a patien t and will perform each of the ultrasound scans using the s ame device as far as possible. Transvaginal ultrasound is preferred, but transabdominal ultrasound may be used as necessary for full visualization of the uterus. The ultrasound method used at s creening should be repeated for the ultrasound at the Week 24 visit. MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 306"

The D1, D2, and D3 locally -determin ed values for the uterus and myoma will be recorded centrally. The images will be submitted for central review to confirm myoma presence and size. At the Screening 1 visit , the longest diameter (D1) of the largest myoma will be noted and recorded. Only the largest myoma among those measurable at the Screening 1 visit will be measured throughout the study. 6.7.1.3. Endometrial Biopsy An endometrial biopsy is to be performed during the pelvic examination at the Screening 3 visit. A second biopsy is to be performed at the Week 24. The biopsies will be read locally , but biopsies may be requested for central review. 6.7.1.4. Pharmacodynamics Sample Collection Blood samples for the pharmacodynamic analysis of serum LH, FSH, estradiol, and progesterone will be collected pre- dose at the visits indicated in the study Schedule of Activities in the protocol synopsis ( see Section 1.1). Th ese pharmacodyna mic samp les will be analyzed at a central laboratory. For PK analysis of estradiol, a separate PK sample will be obtained to be analyzed at a PK laboratory (see Section 6.7.1.5). To maintain blinding, concentrations of these hormones should be reported to the i nvestigator, other vendors, and sponsor personnel only after database lock and unblinding. 6.7.1.5. Pharmacokinetics Sample Collection Blood samples for PK analysis of relugolix, estradiol, and norethindrone will be c ollected pre - dose at the visits indicated in the study Schedule of Activities in the protocol synopsis (see Section 1.1). The actual date and time of each blood sample collection will be recorded. Patien ts will be instructed to hold th eir dose of study drug on clinic visit days and record the time of their previous dose (ie, the time they took their dose on the day before the clinic visit). If the study patient inadvertently took drug at home on the morning of the clinic visit, the dosing history should be accurately recorded and a PK sample collected ( which may be used for population PK modeling). To maintain blinding, PK concentrations will be reported to the sponsor in a blinded fashion, or only after database lock and unblinding.

The sponsor may destroy the samples sooner than 10 year s after the study comp letes. 7. SAFETY CONSIDERATION S Study assessments of safety include adverse events, physical examinations, vital signs (and weight), ECGs, bone mineral density assessments, endometrial biopsy results, and clinical laboratory tests . 7.1. Adverse Event Definitions 7.1.1. Adverse Event Adverse event: An adverse ev ent is any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom , or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product , whether or not related to the medicinal product . Events meeting the definition of an adverse event include : MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 312"
313,page_313,"Clinical Study Protocol: MVT -601-3001 Effective: 10-NOV-2016 Myovant Sciences GmbH 62 CONFIDENTIAL • A worsening, excluding minor fluctuations, in the natur e, severity, frequency, or duration of a pre- existing condition; • Development of an intercurrent illness during the study; • Development of symptoms that may or may not be related to the use of a concomitant medica tion or investigational product ; • Injury or ac ciden ts: If a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or accident, the medical condition and the accident should be reported as 2 separate medical events (eg, for a fall secondary to dizziness, both “dizziness” and “fall” should be recorded s eparately) ; and • An investigational abnormality (eg, labora tory parameter, vital sign, ECG) only if the abnormality is considered clinically significant by the investigator based on at least one of the following criteria: o Induces clinical signs or symptoms ; o Requ ires active intervention ; o Req uires interruption or discontinuation of study drug. Events that do not meet t he definition of an adverse event include: • Medical or surgical procedures (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion); the condition that leads to the procedure is an adverse event ; • Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected before the start of study drug admin istration that do not worsen ; • Situations where an untoward medical event has not occurred (eg, plann ed hospitaliz ation for an elective procedure, with elective defined as known or planned at the time of signing of the informed consent ). Adverse events that occur during the study sh ould be evaluated by the investigator and graded according to Common Terminology Criteri a for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Episodic adverse event s, such as vomiting, or those that occur repeatedly over a period of consecutive days are ‘intermittent’. All other events are ‘ continuous’. Additional information on detecting, documenting, and reporting adverse events and serious adverse events are provided below. No toxicity- related dose reductions of study drug are permitted , however, study drug can be held for a period of up to 2 weeks for evaluation and treatment of an adverse event. The study drug may be restarted if deemed safe for the patient by the investigator. 7.1.2. Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a. Results in death ; b. Is l ife-threatening; NOTE: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the study participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. For ex ample, MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 313"

Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; NOTE: In genera l, hosp italization signifies that the patient has been detained at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out -patient setting. Complications that occur during hospi talization are adverse event s. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the adverse event should be considered serious . Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an adverse event . d. Results in persi stent or significant disability/incapacity ; NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, a nd accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect ; f. Impo rtant medical events which jeopardize the patient an d may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above . Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 7.2. Adverse Event Reporting The reporting of serious adverse events by the sponsor (Myovant Sciences GmbH ) to regulatory authorities is a requirement and each authority has a timetab le for reporting these events based upon established criteria. Likewise, i t is the responsibility of the investigator to report serious adverse events to their local Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC). Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting adverse ev ents and/or serious adverse event s. Open- ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the patien t is the preferred method to inquire about adverse event occurrence. Appropriate questions include: • “How are you fee ling?” • “Have you had any (other) medical problems since your last visit/contact?” • “Have you taken any new medicines, other than those provided in this study, since your last v isit/contact? The patient ’s eDiary entries and answers to the UFS -QoL wi ll not be used as a primary means to collect adverse event s, however they should be reviewed by the study site personnel and the study monitors .

Through this follow -up, if it is determined that an adverse event not previously reported has been identified, normal reportin g requirements should be applied. All patients who experience an adverse event will be evaluated at appropriate time intervals until the event resolves or has stabilized or become chronic. At the conclusion of the study, the investigator and medical monitor will assess unresolved adverse events and determine if additional follow- up is warranted . All adverse events, whether or not related to the study dr ug treatment , must be fully and completely documented on the adverse event case report form and in the patient’s source documents. In addition, any adverse event resulting in permanent treatment discontinuation must be recorded on the appropriate case report form as well as documented in the patient’s source documents. Adverse event terms should include a d iagnosis, as available, in preference to listing the individual signs and symptoms. If the diagnosis is not known, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as an individual adverse event. Overdose and pregnancy in the patient or partner will be repor ted as described in Section 7.7 and Section 7.8, respectively. 7.2.1. Adverse Event Reporting Period Adverse events will b e collected from the time the first dose of study drug is administered until the Follow- up visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug or the date of initiation of another investigational agent or hormonal therapy or surgical intervention, whichever occurs first , as also specified in the study Schedule of Activities ( Section 1.1). Serious adverse events will be c ollected from the signing of the informed consent form until the safety follow -up visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Serious adverse events reported to the inve stigator after the safety reporting period should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator assesses the event as related to the study drug treatment. Any event occurring betwee n signing of the informed consent form and the first dose of study drug will be recorded as medical history and in the patient’s clinical record for any patient who continues to meet eligibility criteria and proceeds to dosing with study drug. Reporting instructions for serious adverse events are provided in Section 7.6. 7.3. Assigning Causal Relationship to Study Drug The reasonable possibility of the relationship of an adverse event to study drug(s) is to be asses sed with careful medical consideration at the time of evaluation of an adverse event. The following definitions are to be used for the relationship of the adverse event to study drug: • Probably related : A cli nical event, including laboratory test abnormal ity, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and that follows a clinically reasonable response on readministration (rechallenge) or withdrawal (dechallenge). • Poss ibly related : A cl inical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug but that could also be explained MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1.

Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear. • Not related : A cli nical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal relationship to drug administration that makes a causal relationship improbable and/or in which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provid e a plausible explanation. All adverse events, whether or not related to study drug, must be fully and completely document ed on the adverse event page of the eCRF and in the patient’s clinical record . In the event a patient is withdrawn from the study because of an adverse event, it must b e recorded on the eCRF as such. 7.4. Assigning Severity Rating for Adverse Events Severity describes the intensity of a specific event (as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious ,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action taken . The investigator must determine the severity of each adverse event according to the Nat ional Cancer Institute CTCAE, version 5.0. For terms not specified with the CTCAE, the criteria in Table 7-1 should be used to determine the grade s everity. Table 7-1 Criteria for Determining the Grade/Severity of Adverse Event Terms Not Specified by the National Cancer Institute CTCAE Version 5.0 Grade Criteria 1/Mild Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated 2/Moderate Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living 3/Severe or medically significant Not immedi ately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; di sabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living 4/Life -threatening Life threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 5/Death Death related to adverse event Adverse event severity should be recorded in the appropriate section of the adverse event case report for m and in t he patient’s source documents. 7.5. Adverse Events of Clinical Interest Reporting Adverse events of clinical interest in this study are defined as any increase in ALT or AST ≥ 3 x ULN .

If the following liv er test abnormalities develop, study drug should be withheld immediately with appropriate clinical follow -up (including repeat laboratory tests, until a patient’s laboratory profile has retur ned to normal/baseline status) , and the event reported as a serious adverse event : • ALT or AST > 8 x ULN; or • ALT or AS T > 5 x ULN and persists for more than 2 weeks; or • ALT or AST > 3 x ULN a nd total bilirubin > 2 x ULN or the International Normalized Ratio ( INR) >1.5 • ALT or AST > 3 x ULN with appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadra nt pain or tenderne ss, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (>5%). Rechallenge may be cons idered if an alternative cause for the abnormal liver tests (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) is discovered and the laboratory abnormalities resolve to normal or baseline values. The investigator and sponsor must discuss and agree with any decision to rechallenge. Rechallenge should not occur when the etiology of the liver test abnormalities is considered possibly drug induced . 7.5.2. Criter ia for Permanent Discontinuatio n of Study Drug in As sociation w ith Liver Test Abnormalities Study drug treatment should be discontinued permanently if all of the following 4 criteria are met (ie, potential severe drug -induc ed liver injury/Hy’s law case): 1. AST or ALT increases to ≥ 3 x ULN; AND 2. Total bilirubin increases to > 2 x ULN o r INR > 1.5; AND 3. Alkaline phosphatase value does not reach 2 x ULN ; AND 4.

Do not delay reporting a suspected serious adverse event in order to obtain additional informati on. Any additional information, if collected, can be reported as a follow- up to the initial report. All serious adverse events will b e followed until resolution, until the event has stabilized, and/or reached a new baseline. All serious adverse events continuing at the completion of the study must be assessed or followed to determine outcome. 7.7. Study Drug Overdose Management The medical monitor must be contacted in the event of any study drug overdose . An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of study drug, to or by a study patien t, at a dose above that assigned to that individual patien t according to the study protocol. For this study, any dose of relugolix > 80 mg within a 24-hour window is an overdose and any dose of estradiol/norethindrone acetate > 2 x the protocol dose is an overdose (ie, more than 2 capsules taken within a 24 -hour window) .

Preg nancy Reporting If any patient becomes pregnant during the study, the site must discontinue the patien t from the study treatment immediately and have her return for an Early Termination visit. The investigator must inform the patient of her right to receive treatment information. If the patient chooses to receive unblinded treatment information, the individual blind should be broken and the treatment assignment provided to the patient. The study team will remain blinded to the patient’s treatment assignment. If the patient agrees , t he investigator should notify the patient’s primary care physician of the pregnancy and provide details of the patient’s participation in the study and treatment (blinded or unblinded, as applicable). A pregnancy is to be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of awareness by the study site personnel, using the Pregnancy reporting forms and contact information in Section 7.6. The expected d ate of delivery or expected date of the end of the pregnancy, last menstruation, estimated conception date, pregnancy result, and neonatal data, etc, should be included in this information , as available.

Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Sy stem (BI-RADS) Category Assessment Follow-up 0 Need additional imaging evaluation: means that more studies are necessary to gather more information. Additional imaging needed before a category can be assigned. 1 Negative: means that there is no significant or noticeable abnormality to report. Continue annual screening mammography (for women over age 40). 2 Benign (noncancerous) finding: means that there has been a finding, such as benign calcifications or fibroadenoma, which is not cancerous. Continue annual screening mammography (for women over age 40). 3 Probably benign: means that there is a finding that is most likely benign, but should be followed in a shorter period of time to see if the area of concern changes. Receive a 6 -month follow -up mammogram. 4 Suspicious abnormality: means that there are suspicious findings that could turn out to be cancer. May require biopsy. 5 Highly suggestive of malignancy (cancer): means that there are findings that look like and probably are cancer. Requires biopsy. 6 Known biopsy -proven malignancy (cancer): means that any findings on the mammogram have already proven to be cancer through a biopsy. Biopsy confirms presence of cancer before treatment begins. MVT-601-3001 CSR - Appendix 16.1.1. Protocol and Protocol Amendments Page 336"
