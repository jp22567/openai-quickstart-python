3,page_3,"SLE and Exercise 4 Leighton Chan 9/23/2019 Précis We propose a single -arm exploratory study to characterize the responses and adaptations to aerobic exercise in women who have mild to moderate systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) uncomplicated by organ damage that would limit participation . This is a pilot study to provide additional preliminary data to support a future U01 application. Persistent, excessive fatigue is among the three most debilitating symptoms of SLE and is cited by as many as 50% of patients as the single most debilitating symptom. We have observed , in women with mild SLE, significant relationships among deficits in work capacity and oxygen consumption obtained during treadmill exercise and patient reported measures of fatigue severity 8. Clinically significant functional aerobic impairment was present in these women , suggest ing an underlying pathophysiological limitation that restrict ed cardiorespiratory capacity to well below that expected to occur as a result of normal deconditioning due to a sedentary lifestyle and lack of physical activity . We have also observed prolonged rest to steady state metabolic transition during even submaximal exercise in women with SLE 10. At peak exercise, muscle oxygenation deficienc y was apparent despite normal increases in central circulatory oxygen delivery to the active muscles. Muscle tissue studies in other laboratories have implicated muscle capillary basal lamina thickening as an oxygen diffusion ba rrier, which could possibly diminish the rate of tissue oxygen uptake and restrict cardiorespiratory capacity. Aerobic exercise training could improve cardiorespiratory capacity in women with SLE and with that improvement precipitate a reduction in their fatigability , particularly if that fatigability is mediated by impaired cardiorespiratory function . Our research team is uniquely qualified to undertake this research and is one of the few teams possessing the experience and background necessary for contr ibuting to this novel, understudied, yet critical field of rehabilitation research. For example, in addition to Dr. Keyser’s studies on cardiorespiratory dysfunction in women with SLE , our team has studied the effects of an intense aerobic exercise -traini ng program in individuals who have pulmonary hypertension (PH) 24,25 or interstitial lung disease (ILD) 26,27, two conditions associated with autoimmune diseases such as SLE. In fact, several of the subjects had SLE and the majority had autoimmune diseases of somewhat similar etiology. Our results demonstrated improved cardiorespiratory function and diminished fatigability in these patients, without serious adverse events, following a 10 -week regimen of intense aerobic exercise training. Adherence to the pr otocol was over 90% in both subject subsets and there were no serious adverse events in either of these groups. Subjects of the proposed research will be between 21 and 80 years of age and living within a reasonable travel distance from the greater Washington D.C. area. Subjects will be recruited from the NIH/NIAMS IRP Lupus Clinics. All tests and exercise training will be conducted at the NIH Clinical Center. There will be a single treatment condition consisting of 12-week s of supervised treadmill walking , three times a week , for 30 minutes per session , at an intensity of 70-80% of the subject’s heart rate reserve. The primary outcome measure for our trial will be the time taken to attain the anaerobic threshold, which is a performance marker of fatigability that is unaffected by patient motivation or perception . Secondary outcome variables will include other measures of cardiorespiratory capacity measured during a cardio pulmonary exercise test (CPET) with accompanying pulmonary gas exchange, central circulatory function (including heart function and an optional measures of peripheral blood flow) and muscle oxygenation analyses . A number of"
4,page_4,"SLE and Exercise 5 Leighton Chan 9/23/2019 questionnaires will also be completed inclu ding: Fatigue Severity Scale, Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS ). All of the se data will be obtained before and after aerobic exercise training . Study Impact: Aerobic exercise is generally safe, inexpensive, and can easily be made available and accessible to almost everyone. It requires no approval by regulatory agen cies and is thus available as a medically prescribed and supervised intervention almost immediately following confirmation o f its safety and efficacy. Effective use of aerobic exercise training as a cardiorespiratory, rehabilitative intervention could h ave a high degree of impact on personal and public health outcomes. Background As many as 1.5 million Americans are living with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) .1, 2 The disease is most prevalent in young African American women3, 4, although the re is significant prevalen ce in all races . The SLE population is indeed aging . Moreover, SLE is similar in etiology and symptoms to more than 100 other autoimmune diseases collectively effecting 1 in 5 individuals living in the U.S. One of the most debilitating symptoms of SLE is excessive fatigue (SLE -fatigue), which persists even during periods of negligible disease activity or r emission. Nearly all patients who have SLE identify fatigue among their three most debilitating symptoms and as many as half report it to be their single most debilitating symptom.2, 6, 7 SLE-fatigue is associated with functional limitations such as physical activity intolerance8, 9 and poor cardiorespiratory fitness8. Management of SLE -fatigue and the resultant physical debilitation has become a clinical and social challenge that spans the entire course of the disease and lifespan. Despite the centrality of this symptom to a patient’s experi ence of the disease, a full understanding of the phenomenon has been hampered by dichotomous scientific perspectives depending on whether “fatigue” is regarded as either a subjective perception of tiredness or as a decrement in performance. The NIH/NIA ha s defined fatigue as “a subjective lack of physical and/or mental energy that is perceived by the individual to interfere with usual or desired activities” (NIH/NIA PA -08-161). Fatigability was defined as a phenotype that associates the degree of fatigue w ith activity of any kind. Physically active people reporting any given level of fatigue are generally less fatigable than their less active counterparts even if those who are less active report the same level of fatigue. Offering additional clarity, the N IH/NIA further defined perceived fatigability as “the change in the feeling of tiredness as a function of duration, intensity and/or frequency of activity” and performance fatigability as “the decline in performance as a function of frequency, intensity, and/or duration of activity” (NIH/NIA PA -12-227). Several methods have been proposed to measure perceived and performance fatigability. A better understanding of the complex phenomeno n of SLE -fatigue will require integration of knowledge derived from measuring both performance and perceived fatigability. However, it remains that performance fatigability is the most objectively measureable subtype and that certain performance fatigabili ty measurements can link mechanistic functions to acute declines in performance, for example, links between exercise -induced fatigue and cardiorespiratory dysfunction."
5,page_5,"SLE and Exercise 6 Leighton Chan 9/23/2019 Cardiorespiratory function supports all physical activity and is the primary support f or engaging in strenuous activities, when these activities are prolonged or when repetitions are frequent. Tench and coworkers,9 reported that peak total body oxygen consumption (VO 2) and physical function scores were significantly lower and fatigue was more severe in 93 patients with mil d SLE compared to 41 healthy controls. Peak VO 2 correlated significantly with physical function but not with fatigue, whereas fatigue severity and physical function were indirectly associated. Conversely, in a later study of 18 women with mild SLE and 16 h ealthy controls, Keyser and associates8 reported that the severity of cardiorespiratory impairment, decline in physical performance, and severity of fatigue were all strongly related. In th e women with SLE, cardiorespiratory function was insufficient for sustaining even instrumental activities of daily living and t he diminished cardiorespiratory capacity appeared to be linked to an underlying pathomechanism. A subset of the same group demons trated protracted responsiveness of the cardiorespiratory system to both moderate and vigorous energy demands.10 These findings provide strong evidence for a potentially med iating influence of cardiorespiratory impairment on performance fatigability in women with SLE. Three studies have reported improvements in cardiorespiratory function, fatigue and/or physical activity following aerobic exercise training. Robb Nicholson an d coworkers11 reported a significant increase i n cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) duration over controls follow ing aerobic exercise training. The improvement was associated with decreased patient -reported fatigue severity. A significant within group improvement in cardiorespiratory capacity was present after training, but this was not significant over controls. De Carvalho and associates12 reported significant exercise training -induced increases in cardiorespiratory fitness that were associated with increases in physical activity in women with SLE. Patient -reported fatigue neither increased nor decreased as a result of training. A third, pilot study with a sample of only six subjects13 found that aerobic exercise training resulted in improvement in SF -36 vitality score in all six women with SLE. Four of the six had increases in peak VO 2 ranging between 2.5 and 3.6 ml/kg/min. The findings of these studies implicated cardiorespiratory fitness as a potential mediator/modulator of perf ormance fatigability in women with SLE and suggested that aerobic exercise may be a sufficient stimulus for evoking a training adaptation in these patients. However, neither performance nor perceived fatigability was directly measured in any of these studi es. The investigators (Drs. Keyser, Chan, and Chin) from the NIH Clinical Center, Rehabilitation Medicine Department have been involved in a clinical trial entitled titled “The NI H Exercise Therapy for Advanced Lung Disease Trials (HEALD: 08 -CC-0133 and14 -CC-0027). HEALD examined the effects of vigorous exercise training on cardiorespiratory function and health related quality of life (including fatigue severity and physical activity) in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) and/or interstitial lu ng disease (ILD). Most of the subjects in HEALD had an advanced lung condition associated with an autoimmune/collagen vascular disease similar to SLE. Several of them had SLE. The preliminary findings of HEALD (24 -27) suggested that vigorous aerobic exerci se training, similar to that proposed in this pilot study, was well tolerated with a high degree of adherence and safe with no serious adverse events, even in these subjects with advanced pulmonary complications associated with autoimmunity . Furthermore, the exercise -training regimen was effective for improving cardiorespiratory function, exercise tolerance, fatigue and fatigability in a subset of patients. The findings of"
6,page_6,"SLE and Exercise 7 Leighton Chan 9/23/2019 HEALD so far have linked the improvements in fatigue and fatigability to increases in cardiorespiratory capacity. In this pilot study we intend to examine the feasibility of translating the methodology used in HEALD to women with SLE who do not have overt cardiac , pulmonary or other system ic complications. Specific Aims 1. Generate dat a that can b e used for the planning of larger randomized controlled studies (RCT) . This is the primary aim of this pilot study. Specifically, this p ilot study is preliminary to the submission of a U01 clinical trial on exercise training, fatigability and physical functioning in women with SLE. 2. Preliminary characterization of the performance fatigability and cardiorespiratory adaptation to aerobic exercise training in w omen with S LE. The data to be used in the development of the RCT are the results of the CPET and square wave cardiopulmonary exercise test (swCPET ), which provide physiological markers of performance fatigability. The change in performance fatigability following aero bic exercise training will be the primary outcome variable. Specific markers characterizing performance fatigability are the time taken to attain the anaerobic threshold on the CPET and the oxygen kinetics time constant taken from the swCPET. In addition, we will further characterize the adaptation by evaluating exercise training -induced changes in muscle oxygenation and cardiac function (and optional limb blood flow) , measured non -invasively . 3. Preliminary assessment of stability of disease activity an d effects of training on disease severity. Disease activity will be monitored at baseline, training mid -point, and after training by physical exam, symptom review, and serology. These assessments will contribute to the Safety of Estrogen in Lupus Erythemat osus, National Assessment modification of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA -SLEDAI), which will be calculated at each of the pertinent data points. We will also track the number of flares and medication changes during subjects’ pa rticipation. Here our non -inferiority hypothesis is that the training regimen will have no observable effect on disease activity/severity in this group of women with mild SLE. 4. Assessment of feasibility and patient motivation to participate. We will tr ack and monitor the number of patients participating in the Pathogenesis and Natural History of SLE study, who indicate interest and willingness to participate. We will also monitor compliance and attendance with the exercise sessions as well as adherence to the prescribed intensity and duration of exercise during the training sessions. We will query all participants who drop out of the training regimen in order to compile a list of reasons that may affect participation. Study Overview We propose to enroll 30 sedentary, adult, women with negligible to mild SLE disease activity (SELENA -SLEDAI ≤ 4) in this pilot study with the goal of accruing 20 evaluable subjects . Subjects must also have a Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) composite score ≥ 3. We will restrict our recruitment to women with SLE as this is a small pilot study and would like to eliminate possible"

Visit 1 : During this visit , subject s will sign the informed consent. To determine eligibility , subjects will first undergo medical history, physical exam, echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, pulmonary function tests , and complete the FSS questionnaire to ensure meeting of the inclusion crite ria and absence of an exclusion criterion (below). Blood and urine samples for the evaluation of safety and SLE disease activity, and serum or urine pregnancy tests will be drawn at this visit. Research samples will also be collected at this visit . We will do SELENA -SLEDAI, Systemic Lupus International Collaborati ng Clinics/American College of Rheumatology damage index ( SLICC/ACR - DI) at this visit. This visit will require up to four hours to complete. Pre-screening procedures performed within the pa st 30 days under the Studies of the Pathogenesis and Natural History of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus protocol (94-AR-0066) may be included in this study. This is to avoid patient inconvenience and repeat testing. Research data from the same subject may als o be shared directly with NIAMS investigators on protocol 94-AR-0066 . Pre-screening assessments may be collected on multiple days to accommodate the patient’s schedule. 2. Visit 2 : This visit will occur within 14 days of completion of all pre -screening assessments (Visit 1) . All eligible subjects will complete a treadmill CPET to volitional exhaustion to evaluate cardiorespiratory capacity and to obtain anaerobic threshold and peak heart rate measures from which the work rate for the VO 2 on-kinetics test s and the exercise training target heart range can be determined. Bioimpedance cardiography (ZCG) and arterial occlusion with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS ) will be performed before the CPET. The subjects will also complete the PROMIS instrument. The vi sit will require three hours to complete. 3. Visit 3 : Subjects will undergo one submaximal swCPET, treadmill VO 2 on-kinetics test, which is a submaximal, moderate exercise intensity test. Arterial occlusion with NIRS will be performed before the swCPET. Bioimpediance cardiography (ZCG) will be measured during the swCPET. The VO 2 on-kinetics test s will be used to evaluate how readily the oxidative metabolic pathway can respond to increased work rates and energy demands. The VO 2 on-kinetics test will take p lace 1-7 days after Visit 2 and will require about two hours to complete. 4. Visit 4 and Exercise Training Session 1 : This visit will be conducted between 1-7 days after the completion of Visit 3, and may be perform ed over multiple days to accommodate the patient’s schedule . This visit will also include the first exercise session of the 36 -session aerobic exercise -training regimen. Subjects who would like to participate in the optional non -invasive vascular studies to examine the effect of exercise on vascular function in patients with SLE will do so at this visit. The methods for these studies are described in the research testing section and will take an additional 1.5 hours to complete. After the vascular studies and a light breakfast (since a 3-8 hour fast is required before vascular study testing) , there will be a timed walk test to evaluate performance fatigability by measuring how far the subject can walk over a 10 -minute interval (10 -minute timed walk test). After a nother brief rest, subjects will complete 20 additional minutes of treadmill walking exercise at the target heart rate to be used for exercise training (70-80% heart rate reserve calculated from CPET) . Target heart rate will"

The evaluation will consist of a medical history, physical examination, serological evaluation, and completion of the SELENA -SLEDAI, SLICC/ACR -DI and the F SS questionnaire. Subjects will undergo pulmonary function tests with DLCO to rule out obstructive and restrictive lung disease, and doppler echocardiography to rule out left ventricular dysfunction, cor pulmonale and pulmonary arterial hypertension , and an electrocardiogram to rule out abnormal cardiac rhythm and myocardial injury. Subjects meeting inclusion criteria and not meet ing an exclusion criteri on will be qualified for participat ion in the study . Participating subjects will then complete the aerobic exercise training regimen, interim tests , medical evaluations, and post - training tests, which are similar to those completed at baseline. Medical Tests : Blood Draw : Patients will undergo a blood draw in the National Institutes of Health Phlebotomy Laboratory or the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine. Nine tests will be run with approximately 5 tablespoons of blood taken vi a a standard blood draw technique . Additionally, approximately 6 tablespoons of blood will be collected via PAX gene, Serum Separator Tube , sodium heparin and CPT tubes and used for research purposes . 1) Nt ProBNP: N-terminal pro b - type natriuretic peptide assays will be performed before and after the intervention period to objectively monitor for potential myocardial damage.

Follow -up pregnancy tests will be perf ormed at subsequent testing visits to the National Institutes of Health. In order for a patient to be enrolled or continue with this study, this test must be negative. Electrocardiogram: All subjects will be screened for signs/symptoms of coronary arte ry disease, cardiomyopathy, or any other underlying cardiovascular diseases that may increase the subject’s risk of performing an exercise -based intervention by screening all patients with a 12 lead electrocardiogram (EKG). This will be performed in the N ational Institutes of Health Electrocardiography Laboratory prior to the subject’s inclusion in the study. Subjects will be required to lay supine on an examination table while 1 2 electrodes are placed on the subject’s chest and then connected to an elect rocardiogram by an EKG technician. A cardiologist will interpret all electrocardiograms prior to the performance of any exercise testing. Echocardiogram : Cardiac echo is required for this protocol. Subjects must not have pulmonary hypertension (PH) and have an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≥50%. To evaluate both of these measures, all subjects will be required to undergo a Doppler echocardiogram prior to inclusion in the study. This may be perfor med at the National Institutes of Health Echocardiogram Laboratory. A transducer placed on the subject’s chest will allow us to measure the subject’s right ventricular size/thickness and systolic pressure. 1) PH causes a retrograde flow of blood from the pulmonary arteries into the right ventricle (RV) which, when chronic, results in ventricular remodeling, increasing the size and thickness of the myocardium, thus increasing the chronic RV systolic pressure. To determine the probability of PH we will use the guidelines as presented in the 2015 ESC/ERS guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of PH.29 These guidelines suggest using tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV) at rest and the presence of additional pre -specified echocardiographic variables sugge stive of PH. The probability of PH may then be judged as low, intermediate, or high (Table A). Echocardiographic ‘PH signs’ used in addition to criteria based on TRV provide an assessment of the RV size and pressure overload, the pattern of blood flow ve locity out of the RV, the diameter of the PA and an estimate of RAP (Table B). Based on echocardiogram interpretation, the patient will be admitted to the study if the probability of pulmonary hypertension is low or intermediate. Table A"

Echocardiographic signs from at least two different categories (A/B/C) from the list should be present to alter the level of echocardiographic probability of pulmonary hypertension. LVEF will be estimated through echocardiogram volumetric measurements of the left ventricle. Placing the transducer over the subject’s left ventricle allows for the measurement of the chamber’s size in end -systolic and end -diastolic states thus giving an estimation of LVEF by comparing the difference in size. Subjects in this protocol will be required to have an estimated LVEF of ≥50%, because a decreased LVEF will increase the risk of exercise testing/training in this study population. Pulmonary Functio n Test: Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Maximal Voluntary Ventilation (MVV), and Diffusion Capacity (DLCO) tests will be assessed for all subjects. These tests will be performed at the National Institutes of Health Pulmonary Function Laboratory prior to inclusion in the study. FVC is used to evaluate the degree of obstructive and restrictive lung disease. MVV is used to evaluate the subject’s ventilatory limitation. Both tests will be obtained while the subject is at rest. We will determine whether the subject ’s exercise capacity is limited by ventilation by computing the ratio between expired minute ventilation (Ve) measured at maximum exercise and MVV (Ve / MVV must not exceed 0.90). To perform the FVC and the"
13,page_13,"SLE and Exercise 14 Leighton Chan 9/23/2019 MVV test the subject will be instructed to stand, plug their nose with their free hand (or wear a nose clip) and create an airtight seal over the mouth piece. For the FVC, the subject will be asked to take in three regular breaths, followed by a deep inhalation and a quick and complete exhalation , blowing air until there is nothing left to expire. This test will be performed 2 -3 times. Completion of the test will be when two test results are within 5% of each other. For the MVV, the subject will be asked to breathe in and out normally three tim es followed by breathing in and out rapidly (90 -100 breaths·minˉ¹) for 12 -15 seconds. The teeth and tongue must refrain from blocking airflow. A DLCO test is used to determine the lungs’ ability to exchange gases across this respiratory membrane wall. Using a mouthpiece and nose clip, the subject will be required to inhale air containing a small amount of carbon monoxide and then exhale rapidly fo r 10 seconds. Exhaled air is then measured to determine the amount of carbon monoxide that is absorbed by the lung tissue and as such determine the subject’s diffusion capacity. Research Tests : Fatigability Tests: For this measure, subjects will complet e a 10 -minute timed walk test. Subjects are instructed to walk as far as they can, in ten minutes. Velocity measurements are taken each minute and at 2.5 minutes. Two fatigability types, perceived and performance, are measured during a 10 -minute walk test. Fatigability is best defined as the change in physical performance or/and feelings of tiredness over the duration of a particular intensity, duration or frequency of activity (NIH/NIA PAR -12-227). Performance fatigability is the decline in physical perfo rmance over time and is measured directly in the laboratory or as a field test in the clinic by measuring physical performance over, in our case, work intensity sustained for a given duration. A performance fatigability index is calculated by dividing the average velocity of the entire 10 - minutes of the test into the average velocity over the first 2.5 minutes (decline in performance) and further dividing the previous quotient in performance by the total distance walked (an index of intensity). Perceived f atigability is simultaneously evaluated by having the subject rate perceived changes in the feeling of tiredness over the 10 -minutes of the test on a numerical visual response scale and dividing the change by the total distance walked. This test will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. Treadmill Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test (CPET) : We will be measuring time to anaerobic threshold (AT -time) during this test. The anaerobic threshold is a physiological measure that is unaffected by motivation or the p erception of fatigue, which indexes the metabolic intensity at which intracellular buffering capacity is exceeded . For activity intensities above the anaerobic threshold , oxidative metabolism is insufficient for supplying all of the ATP needed to sustain the work rate resulting in increased glycolytic supplementation . The by -products of anaerobic glycolysis and insufficient buffering, particularly free ions and metabolic acids, mediate fatigue. Above the anaerobic threshold, glycolytic supplementation inten sifies as the energy demand increases. Measuring the AT -time during CPET further scales the index to exercise duration. Thus, AT -time is a physiological measure of performance fatigability in which its prolongation reflects low fatigability and shortening reflects proportionally higher levels. This test will also include muscle oxygenation and cardiac function measurements described below. Ratings of Perceived Exertion ( RPE) will be measured incrementally throughout the CPET. Each CPET will take about 120 minutes to complete and one CPET will be performed at baseline and one will be performed after exercise training (for pre to post -training comparison)."
14,page_14,"SLE and Exercise 15 Leighton Chan 9/23/2019 Square Wave CPET (swCPET) : The swCPET is a submaximal, moderate treadmill test of 3 moderate bouts of continuous work rate exercise alternated with longer bouts of active rest at low intensity. The bouts are comprised of an initial stabilization period of treadmill walking at 0.7 mph for 3 mi nutes. The stabilization bout is followed by an increase in walking velocity to that corresponding to 85% of the anaerobic threshold measured on the CPET sustained for six minutes. The 6 -minute interval is followed by an 8 -minute active rest period. The 6 -minute exercise, 8 -minute recovery sequence is repeated a total of three times. This test is used to measure VO 2 on-kinetics. VO 2 on-kinetics is a measure of the rapidity with which the cardiorespiratory and oxidative metabolic systems can respond to incr eases in energy demand. Prolonged VO2 on -kinetics contributes to increased fatigability whereas more rapid VO 2 on- kinetics is associated with lower levels of fatigability. Muscle oxygenation and cardiac function measurements will also be made during this t est, as will RPE . One of these tests will be completed at baseline and since the work intensity is based on CPET performance, two will be performed after completing the exercise training regimen: one at the original baseline intensity and one at a new int ensity established from the post -training CPET. These tests will each take about 45 minutes to complete. Near Infrared Spectroscopy: Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) will be used to assess microvascular reactivity and muscle oxygen extraction. Both of th ese components are necessary for optimized cardiorespiratory function. Diminished muscle oxygenation capacity is associated with exercise intolerance and performance and perceived fatigability. The NIRS test will be performed during a gastrocnemius total a rterial occlusion to assess muscle oxygenation capacity test just prior to the CPET and swCPET . The NIRS light emitters and sensors will be left in place to assess the muscle oxygenation during the swCPET and CPET . The NIRS analysis will help to determine the relative contribution of muscle oxygenation to overall oxygen kinetics in these women with SLE. Times for preparation and making the occlusion measurements are included in the time estimates for both the CPET and swCPET. Arterial Occlusion Muscle Oxyg enation Capacity Test: NIR light source and receiving sensors will be placed on the belly of the dominant gastrocnemius muscle to record muscle oxygen - hemoglobin flux. A blood pressure cuff will be placed around the distal hamstrings of the dominant leg. Using a Hokanson® rapid inflation vascular testing system, the cuff will be rapidly inflated to a pressure that totally occludes blood flow into the gastrocnemius, typically between 60 and 80 mmHg above systolic pressure. The occlusion will be maintained for up to 10 minutes and tissue saturation will be measured over the time course. The tissue saturation index will be calculated as STI= [O2 -Hb] / Tot -Hb. The rate of decline in STI will be the main muscle tissue saturation measure. Bioimpedance Cardiography (ZCG) Test: Bioimpedance cardiography will be used to measure changes in cardiac function at rest and during exercise and the cardiodynamics associated with VO2 on -kinetics . Data will be collected before and after the 12 -week aerobic exercise -training regimen. The primary variables for this test are cardiac output and stroke volume however, other cardiac function variables will also be available. The ZCG analysis will be performed during both the CPET and the swCPET. Aluminum/aluminum chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrodes will be placed on the sternum at the level of the heart and another to the standard precordial V6 position. Two Ag/AgCl electrodes will also be placed on the lateral triangle of the neck and two directly over the spine at the level of the xiphoid process. Data will be measured prior to each CPET after subjects rest for at least 10 minutes in a semi -recumbent position. Measurements will subsequently be taken in the standing position on the treadmill and then"
15,page_15,"SLE and Exercise 16 Leighton Chan 9/23/2019 continuously during both the CPETs and the swCPETs. Time requirements have been included in the estimates for both CPET and swCPET. Biomarkers and Mitochondrial Profile : We will collect samples of whole blood, serum CPT and PAX gene tubes for future exploration biomarkers with fatigab ility. These include serum cytokine markers such as but not limited to IL -2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL -9, IL-10, IL-12, IL -15, IL - 17, IL -23, IFNα, IFNγ, TNF -α and TGF -β, and interferon gene signature.30 They also include analysis to look for alterations in the “interferon signature” and the “granulocyte signature” in PBMCs using nanostring and measures of CD3+ T cell expression of IFN regulatory factor - related genes using RNAseq and/or NanoString. We will collect whole blood samples to assess mitochondrial prof ile of the PBMCs. This includes testing for the maximum respiratory capacity, spare respiratory capacity, and ATP production of PBMCs. The amount of blood drawn for clinical care indication and research purposes will be kept within the NIH guidelines of 10.5 mL/kg or 550 mL, whichever is smaller, over any 8-week period for adults. We plan to collect samples during Visits 1, 5 and 7 . Non-Invasive Vascular Function Testing (Optional ): Changes in vascular function, as assessed by the reactive hyperemia index (RHI) using Endopat device, arterial stiffness using cardio -ankle vascular index (CAVI), and by using SphygmoCor device to determine c entral blood pressures and arterial stiffness. Patients with SLE have vascular endothelial dysfunction and premature atherosclerosis. To date there are no studies looking at effect of exercise on vascular function in patients with SLE. These are surrogate markers of vascular damage and future atherosclerosis development which may be amenable to change within the timeframe of this study. Pulse wave analysis (SphygmoCor): This optional proce dure will be performed duringVisits 4, 5 and 6. SphygmoCor is a set of non -invasive tools used to determine central blood pressures and arterial stiffness. It (1) derives the pressure wave from the ascending aorta to the carotid artery and (2) gives an accurate measurement of pressure at the heart, brain, and ki dneys. However, it cannot be used on patients who may suffer from heart arrhythmias or arterial stenosis. The SphygmoCor consists of the following: SphygmoCor Px Pulse Wave Analysis System – a diagnostic tool to measure central blood pressure . SphygmoCor Pulse Wave Analysis System – an algorithm used to determine central aortic pressure and visualize ventricular - vascular interactions . SphygmoCor Pulse Wave Velocity System - a tool that derives a pressure pulse waveform using the pressure tonometer and an ECG signal simultaneously. Arterial tonometry uses a pressure sensor to detect the speed of a pulse wave and may indicate a problem in the arteries. SphygmoCor Pulse Wave Monitoring System – a tool that provides an estimated pressure waveform from the a scending aorta. Cardio -ankle vascular index (CAVI): This optional procedure will be performed the morning of Visits 4, 5 and 6 . For this procedure, placement of ECG electrodes on both wrists and a microphone for phonocardiograph on second intercostal spa ce and 4 blood pressure cuffs wrapped around 4 extremities. Arterial stiffness is calculated followed specified formulas. Main advantage of this procedure versus other procedures to measure arterial stiffness is that it is not altered by blood pressure. I n addition, it is simple to perform. All vasodilators, antihypertensives"
16,page_16,"SLE and Exercise 17 Leighton Chan 9/23/2019 and statins will be held the morning of the test and will be restarted after the procedures are completed. This is in order to avoid having additional variables interfering with the readings of the vascular measurements. The test takes approximately 20 minutes to be performed. Peripheral arterial tonometry (Endopat ): This optional procedure will be performed the morning of Visits 4, 5 and 6 . EndoPAT™ quantifies the endothelium -medi ated changes in vascular tone, elicited by a 5 -minute occlusion of the brachial artery (using a standard blood pressure cuff). When the cuff is released, the surge of blood flow causes an endothelium - dependent. Flow Mediated Dilatation (FMD). The dilatati on, manifested as Reactive Hyperemia, is captured by EndoPAT as an increase in the PAT Signal amplitude. A post - occlusion to pre -occlusion ratio is calculated by the EndoPAT software, providing the EndoPAT index. The test takes approximately 15 minutes to complete, is very easy to perform, and is both operator and interpreter independent. It is a noninvasive test, providing automatic analysis, office -based procedure. The five -minute blood pressure cuff inflation is an accepted standard test to cause reactiv e hyperemia (the increase of blood flow after a temporary restriction in blood supply) for the assessment of endothelial function. While the occlusion may cause some minor discomfort, and tingling in the fingers, the test is absolutely harmless. It is rec ommended that the patient fast 3 to 8 hours before the test. Subjects will be requested to hold all medications including but not limited to all vasodilator, antihypertensive and statin on the morning of the test. Subjects will be requested to bring their medication with them on the day of the procedure they will resume their medications right after the completion of procedures. This is in order to avoid any possible confounding variables interfering with the readings of the vascular measurements. Heart ra te variability (HRV) : HRV may be calculate d during rest and exercise using the ECG and HR data collected during the CPET, swCPET, exercise sessions and /or vascular function tests to examine autonomic functioning. Patients with SLE have been reported to have decreased HRV at rest, suggesting autonomic dysfunction in this population . There have been no studies that examined HRV during exercise and as a result of exercise training in patients with SLE. Health Related Quality of Life Measures PROMIS and FSS-: These are validated patient reported outcome measure s. The fatigue, physical function, mental and sleep domains will be scored for each of these scales. Use of PROMIS and FSS, will permit an assessment of the relative contributions of factor s, other than cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity, such as mental and social functioning, to fatigue. Examining the relationships among fatigue and physical function provides an index of general fatigability. PROMIS will provide a venue for ch aracterizing health related quality of life. These questionnaires are estimated to take 30 minutes to complete. Treadmill Exercise T raining : After the above baseline tests are completed, subjects will undergo aerobic exercise training. The training regimen used in this project is known to elicit improvements in cardiorespiratory function in healthy cohorts and in those who have chronic illnesses in general. This training regimen has been shown to improve cardiorespiratory function and fatigue/fatigab ility in patients with autoimmune disease comorbid with pulmonary hypertension and/or interstitial lung disease , with subject adherence to the protocol at over 90% in both subject subsets and with no serious adverse events in either group . The target train ing heart rate range is 70 -80% of heart rate re serve, computed as: 0.7 and 0.80 (peak heart rate minus resting heart rate) + resting heart rate. This method allows for the target heart rate range to be determine relative to each subject’s own capacity sinc e it accounts for both the resting as well as"
17,page_17,"SLE and Exercise 18 Leighton Chan 9/23/2019 the measured maximum heart rate. The 70 -80% range defines performance of physical activity that is within the recommendations for prescription of safe, effective, and enjoyable exercise put forth by the Americ an College of Sports Medicine (ACSM).28 The frequency of the visits will be on average three times per week, unless make up visits are needed in order to atte nd 80% or 29 visits in 12 weeks. During the training session, heart rate, treadmill speed, tread mill inclination, and RPE will be recorded. In the event that subjects cannot sustain 30 minutes of continuous treadmill walking at the target intensity, an interval approach will be used in which walking at the target will be sustained at smaller training interval durations of no shorter than 5 minutes followed by an active rest interval that is no longer than 1.5 times the training interval until the subject achieves a total exercise time of 30 minutes, excluding the rest intervals. Each of these sessions will last about 60 minutes but slightly longer if an interval approached is used . Post Training Protocol : After completing the 12 -week aerobic exercise training regimens, subjects will repeat the medical examinations, 10 MWT, vascular studies, CPET with muscle oxygenation and cardiac function measures, swCPET, fatigability tests, PROMIS, Fatigue Severity Scale, SELENA -SLEDAI, and SLICC/ACR -DI. Pre-post differences in the outcome measures will then be compared between the groups and analyzed for clinical and biological relevance. Statistical Analysis Pre-post differences in the outcome measures will be analyzed for clinical and biological relevance using t tests or ANCOVA to control for confounding or intervening modulators if discovered. The p rimary outcome variable for this study is the change in performance fatigability as determined by pre to post exercise training changes in the time taken to attain the anaerobic threshold on the CPET and oxygen kinetics time constant measured during the sw CPET. We also assess changes in the performance fatigability index (PFI) and the perceived fatigability index. Secondary outcome measures will include exercise training induced changes in muscle oxygenation and cardiac function, as well as changes in ques tionnaire responses, including the PROMIS and Fatigue Severity Scale. Changes in disease activity and severity will be assessed by comparing post -training to baseline scores on the SELENA -SLEDAI and SLICC/ACR -DI. As change in these measures are expected to be small, Chi -square tests or logistic regression after dichotomizing changes into categories of up to no change and increase by at least 3 points will be used. Subject Withdrawal Subjects may withdraw voluntarily anytime during the study. Any subject who misses more than 7 exercise training sessions without making them up before the end of the study or missing more than 2 consecutive weeks of exercise at the NIH Clinical Center will be withdrawn. Subjects who develop a SLE flare , defined as an increase in SELENA -SLEDAI score of ≥4 compared to baseline during the study or any other medical condition as determined by the clinician that will impair their ability to participate in the study will be withdrawn. In addition, the emergence of any of the exclus ion criteria after subject enrollment or any changes in medications that may make subject participation unsafe or interfere with the study interpretation will lead to that subject’s withdrawal. Any subject withdrawn after completion of more than 12 visits will not be replaced."
18,page_18,"SLE and Exercise 19 Leighton Chan 9/23/2019 Risks and Discomforts to Subjects: 1. CPET : The most serious risks of participating in vigorous exercise are cardiovascular abnormalities including sudden cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, angina and electrocardiographic abnormalities, shortness of breath, dizziness, early fatigue onset and exhaustion. These risks are slight and the likelihood of their occurrence is small even in individuals with known coronary atherosclerosis or chronic heart failure during maximal exercise testing. The general risk of serious adverse events during CPET is low at 0.0 to 8.3 per 10,000 tests.14-23 Pre-screening minimizes the risk to almost negligible levels. Exercising at submaximal intensities, such as during aerobic exercise training, carries with it an even lower risk of serious adverse events that is not gr eater than that occurring during routine activities or exercising in unsupervised settings. To minimize risk and maximize safety, subjects will be evaluated by medical history and physical examination, ECG , Doppler cardiac echocardiography, and pulmonary function tests with DLCO, to exclude those with contraindications to exercise prior to initial CPET. During CPETs , subjects will be monitored by continuous 12 -lead EKG and before beginning the tests subjects will be informed of the signs and symptoms of he art disease and questioned frequently during the test regarding their presence. Staff with training appropriate for exercise testing and training will supervise CPET and training sessions for individuals with chronic illnesses, credentialed by the NIH Clin ical Center, Rehabilitation Medicine Department, in which the testing and training procedures will take place. 2. PROMIS and FSS: These questionnaires are generally not provocative and used to describe overall domains relative to health quality of life. The major risk associated with their use is accidental identification of the data. To avoid this, no names or other personal identification information will be written or attached to the questionnaire forms. To de -identify the data, the completed questionnai res will be li nked to other study data only by a study identifier, which will be a number assigned to each subject’s information. The identification key will be kept in secure files in the offices of Dr. Chin, Dr. Keyser and Dr. Hasni and available only to Drs. Chin, Keyser and Hasni. 3. Square wave CPET (swCPET) : This test does not require vigorous levels of exertion, is of moderate intensity and does not use an exercise intensity greater than that encountered in routine daily activities . As such the risk to patients is minimal. The major risk of this test is tripping and falling on a moving treadmill belt or falling off the treadmill. This could result in contusions and bruising, lacerations, abrasions from the treadmill belt, concussion, and sprains, stra ins and fractures. Again these risks are minimal. To optimize safety, swCPETs will be conducted after first completing the CPETs as described above. Thus, subjects will have demonstrated their ability to safely exercise at a severe intensity that is much higher than the moderate intensity used for the swCPET. The tests will be conducted by t rained and experienced staff all of who m are credentialed to supervise cardiopulmonary testing in the NIH Clinical Center, Rehabilitation Medicine Department after phys ician clearance of the subject for testing. The treadmill itself is equipped with 2/3 length handrails to enable the subject to maintain balance or catch herself in the event of a stumble. At least two staff members will be present for the swCPET and subje cts will have been pre -screened for all exercise and tests by a physician prior to participation."
19,page_19,"SLE and Exercise 20 Leighton Chan 9/23/2019 4. Fatigability Tests : Subjects are instructed to walk as far as possible around an 80 -meter circular corridor in 10 minutes . The major risks to this test are stumbles and falls, which could result in sprains, strains, fractures, contusions, and concussion. Additional risks include chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, pallor, diaphoresis, heart attack, cardiac arrest and s udden death similar to the CPET. To maintain the safety of participation in this test, all Fatigability tests will be conducted after the CPET, which imposes volitionally maximum cardiovascular stress. Only subjects able to tolerate the CPET without clini cal signs and symptoms of cardiovascular disease will be enrolled in the study. Therefore, subjects will have demonstrated their ability to tolerate exercise intensities and stress greater than that imposed by the 10 - minute walk test. Credentialed staff wi th expertise in exercise testing will conduct the 10 - minute walk test. Subjects will sit immediately following the test to avoid falling in the event they would become dizzy after strenuous exercise. 5. NIRS Test with Arterial Occlusion Muscle Oxygenation Cap acity Test : The near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) test involves placing infrared light emitters and sensors on the belly of the gastrocnemius (calf) muscle. These are held in place by a sticky cement and are often covered with an elastic wrap to help hold them in place. The light itself does not cause burns and we could find no reports o f any untoward events regarding the use of NIRS. Some very minor risk may be due to minor skin breakdown under the emitter/sensor patches. This usually resolves in a few hou rs to several days and is usually not painful or uncomfortable. This test also involves total occlusion of blood flow just above the knee. Subjects may experience pain, tingling, and/or numbness in the lower leg during the test. To diminish these effects , occlusion time will be kept minimal, after observing complete deoxygenation of the gastrocnemius muscle (not more than 10 minutes). No ischemic injury is associated with this test due to the high anaerobic capacity of skeletal muscle and the short occlu sion time. Arterial occlusion for measures of reactive hyperemia is a non -invasive and safe technique commonly used in patients with peripheral vascular disease. We are using arterial occlusion in our current interstitial lung disease (ILD) protocol. Of th e 16 participants who have completed the ILD study, three participants did not participate in the a rterial occlusion due to Raynaud’s Syndrome and one requested to stop due to discomfort. All participants fully recovered within minutes of cuff removal with no reports of residual pain or discomfort after leaving our facility. There have been no adverse events from arterial occlusion in our lab. It is a well -accepted procedure deemed safe and tolerable . 6. Bioimpedance Cardiography (ZCG) Test : This test involves passing a small, unnoticeable electrical current between electrodes of known distance on the thorax and back. The voltage and amperage of the current is below the threshold for perception or stimulation of action potentials in skeletal, smooth, or cardiac muscle and sensory, motor or CNS neurons. We could find no reports of adverse events due to use of the ZCG. Risks are basically those associated with skin breakdown due to sliver/silver chloride electrode patch contact with the skin. Som e slight itching has been reported in some subjects. These symptoms are minimal and last only for a few hours to a few days. 7. Treadmill Exercise Training : The risks are those associated with aerobic exercise and treadmill walking in general. These are the risks of provocation of signs and symptoms of"
20,page_20,"SLE and Exercise 21 Leighton Chan 9/23/2019 cardiovascular disease including chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness/syncope, diaphoresis, sweating, nausea, heart attack and sudden death. Risks also include contusions, abrasions, concussion, sprains, strains and fractures associated with falling on a moving treadmill. Subjects are likely to experience immediate or delayed muscle soreness due to initiating an exercise -training program after having been sedentary. The onset of muscle soreness typically occurs immediately or within 48 hours and lasts a few days to a week. As a method of establishing her exercise training regimen is within the ranges recommended for safe and effective exercise by the ACSM and as a safety precaution, subjects will have un dergone CPET prior to beginning exercise training. The intensity for training will be well below the maximum attained on the CPET and subjects presenting clinical signs and symptoms on the CPET will be excluded from the study. All subjects will be pre -screened and approved for participation by a medical staff member before beginning participation. In addition, treadmills used for training will have handrails and an emergency stop button easily accessible for the subject in the event they begin to fall or ne ed to stop immediately. The stop button is linked to a clip worn on the subject’s clothing and in the event she falls the treadmill will stop immediately preventing further abrasions from a moving treadmill belt. Subjects’ treadmill exercise training sessi ons will be overseen and monitored by staff specifically credentialed for the supervision of aerobic exercise. 8. Echocardiography: The use of diagnostic transthoracic ultrasound is not associated with significant risk. There is however the possibility of an allergic response to the gel used to optimize contact of the ultrasound transducer with the skin in a few people. The allergy may present as a rash and/or itching localized to the area of contact and subsides after a few hours to a few days. 9. PFT with DLC O: Serious risks are not associated with pulmonary function tests or lung diffusion tests. Patients may experience perceptions associated with exertion on the PFT and may feel dizzy and short of breath for a short time after completion of the test. Patient s may also experience slight dizziness and shortness of breath during and shortly after the DLCO procedure. In both cases these symptoms are not specific to any emergent condition, unless severe and persistent, and should only last a few minutes following the tests. 10. Blood draw: The risks are those associated with routine blood draws. These include infection, vein collapse, and the need for multiple sticks. These risks will be minimized by personal credentialed at the Clinical Center for obtaining and handli ng blood samples. On occasion, some subjects may be come dizzy, nauseous, or may fain t at the sight of their own blood. We will instruct subjects to face a different direction during the draws if they are prone to these reactions. If these reactions do occ ur, subjects will be given appropriate instructions for managing them by the trained technician acquiring the sample. 11. Electrocardiogram: There is no clinically significant risk associated with this procedure. There may be minor discomfort, when the ECG ele ctrodes taped to chest are removed. Rarely, a reaction to the electrodes may cause redness or swelling of the skin. 12. Vascular function studies : SphygmoCor, CAVI , and Endopat, (optional ). These procedures are very well tolerated. Other than potential transient minimal discomfort with blood pressure cuff, no side effects are expected."
21,page_21,"SLE and Exercise 22 Leighton Chan 9/23/2019 Benefits to Subjects: This research involves greater than minimal risk with the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects. Potential benefits of participation include improvements in cardiorespiratory capacity that may enable individuals to accomplish a given amount of activity or work at a lower percentage of maximum capacity and with less fatigue. Mor eover, improvement of exercise tolerance generally increases quality of life by permitting individuals to engage more easily in daily physical activities and perhaps full or part time employment. Improved cardiorespiratory fitness may also decrease the ris k for cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, obesity and diabetes mellitus. Human Subject Research Protections (HSRP) Subject Selection Rationale : Patients referred from the Baltimore/Washington/Northern Virginia area will be potential subjects for this study. All subjects will be classified by SELENA -SLEDAI score, which measures Lupus disease activity. No participants will be excluded based on race or ethnicity. Recruitment: Subjects will be primarily recruited from the pool of subjects available at National Institute of Health’s, National Institute of Arthritis, Musculoskeletal, and Skin Diseases clinic. The majority of these subjects are enrolled in the Pathogenesis and Na tural History of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) study, which has been ongoing since the early 1990’s and currently has approximately 1100 enrollees. Other recruitment efforts may be directed toward presentations to Lupus support groups and an introduct ory study letter for local private rheumatology practices. We may also utilize NIH Clinical Center -sponsored digital media resources such as Twitter, Facebook, CC Radio, CC TV, Photo Gallery; databases such as NIH Search the Studies, ClinicalTrials.gov, a nd Research Match; and local newspapers such as the Washington Post to disseminate information about the study to potential participants and their healthcare providers. The recruitment strategy offered by the NIH/CC Office of Patient Recruitment, including sample recruitment messages and advertisements in the form of study flyers will be used. IRB-approved flyers may be left with clinics for interested t reating physicians to refer subjects to this study with approval of the venue or in accord with their pol icy; self -referral is also permitted. Recruitment flyers may also be given directly or sent electronically to those requesting study information. Flyers may be made available at outreach exhibits, speaking engagements, support group meetings, professional meetings or association/trade meetings with approval of the venue or in accord with their policy. Pre-Screening Process in the NIAMS Clinic"
22,page_22,"SLE and Exercise 23 Leighton Chan 9/23/2019 If any physicians in NIAMS feel they have a patient that may be an appropriate candidate for enrollment base d on inclusion/exclusion criteria, then an associate investigator will b e introduced to the patient after a brief overview of the study. If she is interested, they will be consented at that time or make an appointment for a future date in order to be consen ted and tested. If the NIH Study Coordinator or Associate Investigator interviews a potential subject from any source the following script will be followed : “Thank you for your interest regarding the research we are conducting to determine the benefits of an exercise program on Lupu s. We are accepting volunteers 21-80 years of age who have been diagnosed with Lupus, with moderate to severe fatigue, and are currently stable in their disease and treatments. If you are enrolled in the study we would ask tha t you come to NIH for 3 days of testing, which do not have to be in a row, which would include a test to determine how far you can walk in 10 minutes, breathing tests and a treadmill exercise test. During the treadmill test you will have 16 electrodes on your chest, we will ask that you wear a neoprene mask to collect data on the amount of oxygen you breathe in and out, as well as an electrode on your calf to determine the amount of oxygen your muscle utilizes for energy. After testing you will begin an ex ercise regimen that will include 36 exercise training sessions over 12 weeks. Does this sound like something that you would like to participate in?” If they answer “yes,” we ask if they have time to answer a short questionnaire that would allow us to evalu ate their eligibility and safety for inclusion into the study. If, based on this interaction, we think the subject might meet the inclusion criteria for the study, we will request medical records such as (recent history, medication list, pulmonary functi on test, resting EKG, six-minute walk and echo cardiogram ) to further evaluate their eligibility for the study . Their medical records will be reviewed and, if it appears that the patient meets the inclusion criteria, we will set up an appointment for the pa tient to come to the NIH Clinical Center for consent and testing. If, after obtaining a patient’s medical records it is clear that the patient does not meet inclusion criteria, the information may be used to refine our inclusion and exclusion criteria; ho wever, these medical records will not be used for any research purposes. Upon arriving at the NIH, the patient will proceed through admissions and then consented to the study, followed by a history and physical examination , blood draw, ECG, transthoracic echocardiogram, pulmonary function testing, arterial occlusion muscle oxygenation capacity test, cardiopulmonary exercise test, questionnaires, and ten minute walk test. Exclusions: Exclusion of Children: Individuals younger than 21 years will not be incl uded in the protocol because reference ranges for normative aerobic capacity and aerobic fitness have not been established for children and adolescents . The objectives of this project do not include establishing these normative reference ranges. Moreover, far less is understood about Lupus in children and the mechanisms by which it occurs. This lack of information could introduce critical levels of bia s into the interpretation and cause the interpretation of our results to be"
23,page_23,"SLE and Exercise 24 Leighton Chan 9/23/2019 misleading. Exercise response and adaptation in children with Lupus should be studied in separate and specific protocols. Exclusion of Male s: Males account for less than 10% of t hose diagnosed with Lupus and this accounts for less understand ing of Lupus as it relates to males. Due to the limited access of male patients and decreased likelihood to find willing male subjects we chose to exclude them because they will not be a viable comparison for this study. Exclusion of Pregnant Women: Women of childbearing age will undergo urine pregnancy testing during screening and follow -up visits and will be excluded from the study should results be positive. Pregnant women will necessari ly be excluded from the study for safety reasons. Women who do not exercise before pregnancy should not begin a rigorous exercise during pregnancy and would not be able to achieve the target heart rate required as part of the testing and training. Exclu sion of Those Who Are Unable to Provide Informed Consent: Individuals unable to give informed consent will necessarily be excluded from the study because of the risk to subject safety and the need to maintain integrity of the study. Subjects must be able to comprehend and follow directions, and express their own needs adequately during all testing and retesting procedures, and exercise and educational training sessions. Participation of NIH employees : We anticipate eligible NIH employees may participate in this study. We will follow the Guidelines for the Inclusion of Employees in NIH Research Studies and will give each employee a copy of the “NIH information sheet on Staff Research Participation” as per NIH SOP 14F, “Research Involving NIH Staff as Sub jects.” If the employee is within the same branch, section, or unit such that the individual obtaining consent is a supervisor then independent monitoring of the consent process through Clinical Center Department of Bioethics Consultation Service will be requested. Study staff will be trained that communication of any personal or medical information about an NIH employee, including the fact that they are participating in this study, should be restricted to those investigators who need to know this informati on, and such information will not be discussed with anyone outside of the study without permission from the subject. We will discuss the following applicable safeguards to the eligible NIH employee: - Unbiased participation for protocol integrity and partici pant risk assessment. - Ensure there is no perceived workplace pressure or expectation on either participation or deciding not to participate on the protocol in regards to a benefit or adverse effect on their NIH employment or staff position. - Protection of privacy and confidentiality will be maintained, but also with acknowledgement of the limits due to sensitive information that may be in their NIH file. - Discussion of time commitments of the study and compensation in accordance with NIH policy 2300 -630-3, Leave Policy for NIH Employees Participating in NIH Medical Research Studies ."
24,page_24,"SLE and Exercise 25 Leighton Chan 9/23/2019 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan : As the PI, Dr. Chan will closely monitor patient safety throughout the duration of the study. As the medically responsible physician , Dr. Sarfaraz Hasni, will monitor the patient’s condition as it relates to their Lupus disease activity . Since t he risk of performing several exercise tests on patient s with SLE is unknow n, our plan may need more than just PI monitoring, but fails to meet the criteria for the involvement of a full DSMB. We suspect that the risk is a minor increase over minimal risk, but we are not sure. For this reason, w e have enlisted the assistance of Michael M. Ward M.D., Senior Investigator in the Clinical Trials and Outcomes Branch of NIAMS , as the independent medical monitor (IMM) for this study. He will be apprised of all significant adverse events. In addition, this monitor will also have access to the study data. RMD’s Epidemiology and Biostatistics Departme nt will examine the results on an interim basis. If, at any point, they feel that the study should be stopped because of concern for safety of study subjects, they will inform the PI, the IRB, and the clinical and scientific directors of CC and NHLBI. NIH IRB and CD r eporting : Adverse events, non-compliance, protocol deviations, unanticipated problems (UP), and serious adverse events are defined as described in NIH HRPP SOP Policy 801 (“Reporting Research Events ”). All adverse events and deviations occurring during the study, including those observed by or reported to the research team, will be recorded. Reporting research events to the IRB will conform to the reporting requirements and timeframes as specified i n Policy 801. Specifically, any actual or suspected non -compliance, major deviations, or UPs will be reported within 7 calendar days. Deaths that are possibly, probably or definitely related to the research will be reported to the IRB within 24 hours of an investigator becoming aware of the death. Minor deviations, adverse events and SAEs that are not UPs will be summarized and reported to IRB at the time of continuing review, or when otherwise requested by IRB or OHSRP office of Compliance and Training . Conflicts of Interest : This study does not include any commercial interests, technology transfer, or any products made by a commercial interest. No conflicts of interest have been identified for any NIH employees associated with this study. Travel and C ompensation : No travel reimbursement will be provided.

Those deemed appropriate will both read and sign the NHLBI NIH approved consent form. A copy of the signed informed consent shall be given to the individual signing the consent and the original consent document will be re tained in the medical record. Upon giving consent, the subject will undergo a full examination by a physician, and a review of available medical records will be performed to confirm their suitability for the trial. Additionally, they will undergo an echoc ardiogram, EKG, PFT with DLCO and a pregnancy test to ensure the patient is safe to exercise and do not meet any exclusion criteria. After this, they will begin the baseline research tests including: treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise test, arterial occlus ion muscle oxygenation capacity test, pulmonary gas exchange analysis, heart rate measurement, bioelectrical impedance plethysmography, near infrared spectroscopy, six -minute walk and fatigability tests, and patient self-report instruments. All tests will be performed again post rehabilitation for outcome comparisons. Management of Data and Samples : Data will be collected using appropriately calibrated computer -assisted instrumentation, commercial software programs, data collection sheets and self-report ed outcome questionnaires. Clinical Trials Survey System (CTSS) will be used to manage data collection of the following subject self -reported outcome questionnaires and subjects will have the choice of using an NIH mobile device or paper format to comple te the questionnaires. All digital CTDB forms will be considered source documentation. CTDB Source Fatigue Severity Scale Digital or Paper PROMIS Digital or Paper Clinical Trials Database (CTDB) will be used to manage data collection and tracking of the intervention through the use of an NIH mobile device.

26,page_26,"SLE and Exercise 27 Leighton Chan 9/23/2019 Upon enrollment, subjects will be assigned a protoc ol number that will be used as a subject identifier for all subject files and data collection sheets. All computer software with associated data files is kept on password -protected computers that are off -network and are stored in a locked laboratory with restricted access. Paper data collection sheets will be kept in de - identified subject folders in locked filing cabinets in secure areas. Patient consent forms and other relevant medical records with patient names and other identifiable data are kept in s eparate folders and locked in separate filing cabinets. No information will be kept in either folder that could be used to link a subject’s medical record file to a subject’s study data file. Electronic data collected in the laboratory will be transferr ed to a restricted access folder on the Clinical Center network with appropriate firewall protection. Only study PIs and AIs will have access to this folder. A password protected USB device will be used to transfer data. Email communication with patient information or data will be transmitted via encrypte d email as per NIH guidelines. Data will be analyzed as discussed in the Data Analysis section of this document . Analysis will be conducted using an assigned protocol number as the subject identifier described above. Analysis of de -identified data may be performed at George Mason University by approved associate investigators on this protocol . This includes de -identi fied data from the treadmill exercise tests, 10 MWT, fatigability tests, exercise training data and questionnaires. Sample Storage : As described under the biomarkers section we will collect samples of whole blood, serum CPT and PAX gene tubes for future e xploration biomarkers with fatigability and other related research studies . These include serum cytokine markers such as but not limited to IL -2, IL -6, IL - 10, TNF -α and TGF -β, and interferon gene signature.30 The amount of blood drawn for clinical care i ndication and research purposes will be kept within the NIH guidelines of 10.5 mL/kg or 550 mL, whichever is smaller, over any 8 week period for adults. Research samples collected from subjects consenting to this protocol will be stored in locked secure f reezers belonging to NIAMS. The freezers are located in Building 10 at the NIH. Only study investigators and participating research personnel will have access to the samples. Samples will be kept indefinitely unless there is a significant justification f or destroying them. The Principal Investigator will report the loss or destruction of samples collected under this protocol to the Institutional Review Board (IRB). All samples will be coded and will not have personal identifiers. The codes for identifie rs will be contained in a secure electronic database (CTDB) and a subject code log that is maintained in secure research files. An electronic record log with identifiers of all collected research specimens will be kept. These will be stored in secure N IH computers.

Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) Name ______________________________ Date ____________ The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is a method of evaluating the impact of fatigue on you. The FSS is a short questionnaire that requires you to rate your level of fatigue. The FSS questionnaire contains nine statements that rate the severity of your fatigue symptoms. Read each statement and circle a number from 1 to 7, based on how accurately it reflects your co ndition during the past week and the extent to which you agree or disagree that the statement applies to you. A score of 1 indicates you disagree and a score of 7 indicates you agree. FSS Questionnaire During the past week, I have found that: Disagree <-------- > Agree My motivation is lower when I am fatigued. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Exercise brings on my fatigue. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 I am easily fatigued. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Fatigue interferes with my physical functioning. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Fatigue causes frequent problems for me. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 My fatigue prevents sustained physical functioning. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Fatigue interferes with carrying out certain duties and responsibilities. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Fatigue is among my three most disabling symptoms. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Fatigue interferes with my work, family, or social life. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 The Fatigue Severity Scale is copyrighted by Lauren B.
