6,page_6,"Alliance A221504 7 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 1.0 B ACKGROUND 1.1 Rationale for Proposed Study Opioid medications are the mainstay of treatment for severe, chronic cancer pain. The analgesic activity of opioids is mediated via central mu opioid receptors (MORs) in the central nervous system (CNS). However, MORs are also present on endothelial cells1 and in human tumors (peripheral MORs), including lung2-4 and prostate5 cancer. Compelling pre -clinical studies indicate that expression and activation of peripheral MORs are associated with tumor progression in animal models. Recent clinical studies raise the possibility that opioid exposure is also associated with tumor progression in patients with various malignancies including lung cancer. See section 1.7. In patients with advanced malignancies, symptoms related to progression of cancer and its treatments, as well the adverse effects of commonly used opioids, all contribute to impair the health -related quality of life (HRQoL). In view of the above, our long -term goal is to develop a novel, non- chemotherapeutic intervention blocking the activation of peripheral opioid receptors that contributes to tumor progression and adverse effects of opioids may improve the HRQoL of patients with advanced malignancies, and may also improve disease outcomes. Towards this eventual goal, we will perform this pilot study to firs t determine the feasibility and safety of long -term administration of an orally available, FDA -approved, peripherally acting mu opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA) in a patient population receiving standard systemic therapy for advanced, incurable lung cancer. We hope to eventually study this agent in a more advanced phase clinical trial. 1.2 Rationale for selecting lung cancer Worldwide, lung carcinoma is the most common malignancy and the leading cause of cancer deaths. The global incidence of lung cancer was estimated to be 1.8 million cases/year in 2012, resulting in nearly 1.6 million deaths/year (nearly 20% of all cancer deaths). 6 In the United States, the incidence of lung cancer is projected to be 224,390 new cases in 2016, which will lead to approx imately 158,000 deaths (26.5% of all cancer deaths).7 The majority (≥ 80%) of lung cancers are non -small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), of which adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype. Advanced malignancies, including NSCLC, are often accompanied by pain. Approximately 2/3 of patients with advanced malignancies experience pain, with 50% experiencing at least moderate pain; lung cancer ranks third highest for pain prevalence among all malignancies. 8 Malignancy options that were considered for the current study included (a) patients with various advanced malignancies, or (b) patients with a single tumor type (non -small cell lung cancer, pancreatic, breast or prostate cancer). Including patients with diverse malignancies would accelerate accrual and generalization of the results, but we were concerned that heterogeneity in this patient population and their cancer treatments would have an insurmountable impact on statistical analysis of adverse effects and activity. Advanced pancreatic cancer is common, often presents with inoperable/incurable disease in which survival is relatively short, and is associated with severe, refractory pain. However, there is a lack of basic, pre- clinical or clinical data relevant to the current concept. Breast and prostate cancer were not considered as the optimal malignancies to study because long survival of patients with both of those malignancies will require very prolonged follow-up to detect possible benefit. The clinical course and prognosis of the various subtypes of NSCLC including adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are similar (overall response rate of ~30%, time to progression of 4-6 months, 1-year survival of 30-40% and 2 year survival of 10-15%). Impairment of HRQoL (the primary endpoint of this study) is therefore likely to occur at similar time points in patients with adenocarcinoma as in patients with other subtypes of NSCLC."
7,page_7,"Alliance A221504 8 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 Several groups (including ours) have reported that pain/opioids/peripheral opioid receptor activation is associated with poorer outcomes (including shorter survival) in cohorts of NSCLC patients including both adenocarcinoma and other subtypes.24, 47, 48, 49, 58, 59, 93 We and others have also reported that similar effects occur in diverse malignancies, including those of the prostate, breast, pancreas, esophagus, stomach, co lon.5, 48, 53- 59, 94, 95 There fore, the evidence indicates that the association of peripheral opioid receptor activation with poorer clinical outcomes is likely to be a phenomenon that occurs in ma ny common malignancies, and is not restricted to adenocarcinoma of the lung. When this study was initially designed, the standard systemic therapy for adenocarcinoma of the lung was a combination of a platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and pemetrexed, so we accordingly restricted eligibility to adenocarcinoma alone. However, the field has advanced rapidly, and current standard therapy for adenocarcinoma as well as other subtypes of NSCLC includes immune checkpoint inhibitor alone (e.g. pembrolizumab) for all subtypes of NSCLC where tumor PD -L1 expression is ≥50%, and a combination of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy with platinum -based chemotherapy in all subtypes of NSCLC where tumor PD -L1 expression is ≥1%. While pemetrexed itself is not recommended fo r patients with squamous cell carcinoma, the other commonly used standard platinum -based regimens are all Category 1 options common to adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (e.g. those including paclitaxel, docetaxel, etoposide or gemcitabine: NCCN Gu idelines version 6.2018 for Non- Small Cell Lung Cancer ). For the above reasons, we believe that it is no longer necessary to restrict eligibility to adenocarcinoma of the lung, and that patients with other subtypes of NSCLC receiving standard first -line sy stemic therapy should also be eligible. We therefore elected to limit this study to patients with advanced NSCLC, because (a) it is a very common tumor type, (b) patients often present with advanced (incurable) disease associated with relatively short surv ival, (c) there is extensive basic and pre- clinical data available regarding opioid receptor expression and activity that provides a solid scientific basis for this study, as well as retrospective clinical data showing association of opioid exposure with p oorer clinical outcomes, and (d) tumor progression (that usually occurs within 5-8 months of starting first-line chemotherapy 9) impairs HRQoL .10-12 For the above reasons, we expect to reach the primary endpoints relatively quickly in this pilot study. See section 1.7. 1.3 Rationale for selecting feasibility and safety as the primary endpoint: In an initial pilot study, it is most important to determine if (a) a sufficiently high accrual rate will be achieved in a diverse multi- center setting to make it possible to successfully undertake a larger, more definitive study, (b) the majority of patients will be able to continue taking the study drug together with systemic therapy for an extended period, (c) the study drug is associated with an acceptably low rate of severe (grade III or higher) side effects in this sett ing, and (d) there is any signal that administration of the study drug may be associated with unexpected adverse clinical outcomes when given together with systemic therapy . Of note, several pre- clinical studies from study team and others demonstrating tha t PAMORAs inhibit morp hine-induced upregulation of angiogenesis and multi -drug resistance to chemotherapy 13-14 provide reassurance that the study drug is not likely to adversely affect the efficacy of systemic therapy . 1.4 Rationale for estimating change i n HRQoL in the current study Tumor progression is known to impair, and effective chemotherapy is known to improve, HRQoL in advanced NSCLC.11-12 Early initiation of non- chemotherapeutic interventions (e.g., palliative care) in patients with advanced NSCLC further improves HRQoL, irrespective of anti - cancer therapies.15"
8,page_8,"Alliance A221504 9 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 The HRQoL of patients with advanced malignancies is adversely affected by pain and other symptoms due to tumor progression as well as by the adverse peripheral effects of opioid analgesics, including constipation, nausea, vomiting, xerostomia and drowsiness.16 Recent studies further suggest that opioid -associated tumor progression may be an additional factor that impairs HRQoL. In patients with advanced non- squamous NSCLC (adenocarcinoma), pe metrexed -based chemotherapy achieves a median progression -free survival (PFS) of 5.3 (95% CI: 4.8-5.7) months, with a median overall survival (OS) of 12.6 months; approximately 75% patients remain alive at 6 months. 17 Pemetrexed -based induction chemotherapy followed by maintenance pemetrexed achieves a median PFS of 4.4 (95% CI: 4.1- 5.7) months from randomization to maintenance pemetrexed,18 or 7.5 (95% CI: 6.9 -8.6) months from the start of initial induction chemotherapy.9 Overall HRQoL (total FACT -L score) and the trial outcome index (TOI) of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with standard induction chemotherapy declines significantly by 6 months.19 A more recent HRQoL analysis of patients receiving pemetrexed maintenance chemotherapy for NSCLC found that the time to worsening of symptoms (TWS) for pain occurred at a median of 6.1 (95% CI: 4.6 – 9.6) months and TWS for overall HRQoL occurred at a median of 5.8 (95% CI: 4.4 – 8.4) months from randomization to maintenance pemetrexed (please see figure 1). 10 Of note, there was a rapid decline in HRQoL within the first few months of starting maintenance pemetrexed (i.e., after 3 months of prior induction chemotherapy). In the above study, there was a highly significant correlation between TWS of pain or HRQoL and progression- free survival and overall survival (P < 0.0001) for all comparisons, indicating that worsening of pain and HRQoL coincide with disease progression and death.10 The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the American Society of Clinical Onc ology (ASCO) have opined that determining the effect of treatment on symptoms and HRQoL is of major importance in advanced NSCLC.20,21 Accordingly, HRQoL has been used as a primary endpoint in recent phase III trials comparing pemetrexed based chemotherapy with other regimens in NSCLC.22,23 For the above reasons, HRQoL may therefore serve as the “best” overall measure of potential benefit of the study drug with respect to mitigation of opioid- induced tumor progression as well as mitigation of the periphera l adverse effect of opioids. In view of the expected PFS, OS and time to decline in HRQoL in advanced NSCLC (detailed above), we propose to estimate the difference in HRQoL at 6 months in this pilot study, to inform the design of the subsequent phase II or III studies. Patients may experience objective progression of disease by this time, 9,18 but naloxegol/placebo will be continued for up to 2 years, and data will continue to be collected regarding the safety and potential efficacy of the study drug during this time, even in patients who progress on first line therapy. See Section 1.7 . The Alliance has considerable experience in ensuring continued data collection by mail or phone in patients who become unable to come to clinic visits because of clinical deterioration, so we expect the drop -out rates for HRQoL data collection to be relatively low for the proposed duration. 1.5 Rationale for selecting baseline l evels/presence/absence of pain , opioid use and peripheral adverse e ffects of opioids: Inclusion/exclusion criteria regarding pain and opioid use prior to registration/initiation of study : We considered various options, including (a) limiting the study to patients with minimal pre - study pain and little/no opioid use, (b) limiting the study to patients with high levels of pain and extensive opioid use, or (c) not requiring patients to be experiencing a specific level of pain, but only requiring patients to have needed opioid medication(s) for pain within 4 weeks of registration."
9,page_9,"Alliance A221504 10 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 Option (a) would minimize the theoretical likelihood that pain/opioids would have impacted on tumor biology prior to initiation of study drug, but might delay detection of improvement in HRQoL endpoints. Option (b) would increase likelihood of early detection of improvement in HRQoL, but would also increase likelihood of GI side effects of the study drug (due to a rapid reversal of constipation). Such patients may also be too ill to stay on the study for sufficient length of time and experience short survival, compromising their contribution to provide adequate longer -term data on the endpoints being studied. Furthermore, potential benefit of study drug may not be seen because pain/opioids may already have induced tumor angiogenesis/signaling pathways causing tumor progression. Considering all these aspects, we initially selected option (c) because it was suggested by reviewers, that we do this when an early version of this protocol concept was reviewed, it might achieve the best possible balance between testing the underlying pathophysiological phenomena, facilitate rapid enrollment, allow for widest possible applicabi lity of the results, and allow detection of improvement in HRQoL during the planned duration of the study (please see section on HRQoL above, and Figure 1 for the basis for this expectation), since patients would have started requiring opioid medications for pain control already. We did not expect this criterion to create a significant barrier to enrollment, since, in our recent study 24 the majority of patients with advanced NSCLC had required opioids prior to initiation of chemotherapy. Inclusion/exclusion criteria regarding opioid -induced adverse effects prior to registration/initiation of study : The study design includes specifically and prospectively assessing the separate impact of naloxegol on constipation (using a validated opioid- induced constipation [OIC] instrument) and other side effects of opioids (using Linear Analogue Self -Assessment [LASA] and Patient - Reported Outcome - Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [PRO -CTCAE] items) as they may arise over time, so that the results of this pilot study will provide an exploratory assessment of the effect of naloxegol on diverse side effects of opioids in cancer patients, and directly inform the design of a future definitive study. While the patients who we enter on this trial may not have a large number of symptoms or a poor HRQoL at baseline, we fully expect that HRQoL will decrease over time as the lung cancer disease becomes more prominent. Thus, we will have patients who could give a positive HRQoL signal due to beneficial effects on cancer -related symptoms, and perhaps also on peripheral adverse effects of opioids as they arise in patients who requir e escalating opioid doses with cancer progression (see section on HRQoL above, and Figure 1)."
10,page_10,"Alliance A221504 11 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 1.6 Rationale for a 3- arm study design including placebo and 2 dose arms of study drug: Why a pilot study is needed: Data are not available on long -term administration of naloxegol in patients with advanced malignancies receiving chemotherapy. Specifically, what is not know n is: (a) if a sufficiently high accrual rate will be achieved to a study of a PAMORA in patients with advanced malignancy, (b) what proportion of patients can take the study drug together with chemotherapy or other first -line systemic therapy , (c) the length of time patients can stay on the study drug together with systemic therapy, (d) the frequency of severe adverse effects of the study drug, and rate of discontinuation, when given with systemic therapy (d) if there is any signal that the study drug may be associated with unexpected clinical outcomes when given together with systemic therapy, (e) the length of time patients will be compliant with completing HRQoL and other questionnaires in this setting, and (f) if PAMORAs will improve HRQoL, as HRQoL has not been directly assessed in the retrospective clinical studies of PAMORAs thus far. It will be advisable to ascertain the feasibility and safety of administering naloxegol at selected doses in patients receiving systemic therapy for advanced NSCLC, before committing greater resources and a larger number of patients to a phase II or III study. We propose to conduct a pilot, placebo -controlled trial of two FDA -approved doses of naloxegol. This pilot trial will test the feasibility of the study design, prov ide reassurance regarding the tolerability and safety with systemic therapy of at least one of the two doses of naloxegol in this patient population, and perhaps provide a signal regarding efficacy, to inform the design of a subsequent definitive study. Further, the effect of PAMORA medications (e.g. naloxegol) on HRQoL in cancer patients needs to be evaluated prospectively, which we propose to initiate in this pilot study. Use of placebo : A placebo design is essential to provide a control arm for comparison of potential adverse effects and possible activity (difference in HRQoL between the study drug arms and placebo) of the study drug, although it will increase the sample size. Use of a 3- arm design : The commonly used phase I type study design (sequential testing of escalating doses of study drug) will not be optimal for the current study because (a) it will not permit inclusion of a placebo arm, and (b) it will not lend itself well to assessment of [i] relative safety in patients receiving systemic therapy , i.e., relative frequency of systemic therapy side effects and discontinuation in patients receiving systemic therapy without vs with naloxegol, or [ii] efficacy of the study drug with respect to improvement in HRQoL. We therefore elected to use a study design that allows randomization to placebo or one of two doses of the study drug. We have used this design previously. 29,30 We propose to test two doses of the study drug to increase the likelihood of identifying an “optimal” dose, and reduce the likelihood of missing an activity signal because of insufficient dosing (if dosing is based on prior studies where amelioration of opioid- induced constipation was the primary endpoint). We recognize that testing two doses will increase the sample size, and the higher dose may be associated with more adverse effects. Using a placebo and 2 doses of the study drug will still be possible with a sample size of ~200 patients, which is feasible in this setting. We considered several approaches regarding the number of doses (1, 2 or 3) of the study drug to test, before selecting the current 2 -dose design: Testing one dose will require the smallest sample size. However, it may miss potential activity of naloxegol on inhibiting morphine -induced tumor progression, since the currently approved lower dose (12.5 mg/day) is based on activity in ameliorating opioid- induced constipation. Mechanisms such as higher levels of drug efflux from malignant cells may require a higher dose for optimal activity against tumor progression."
11,page_11,"Alliance A221504 12 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 Testing three doses will increase the likelihood of identifying an “optimal” dose, and reduce the likelihood of missing an activity signal because of insufficient dosing (if dosing is based on prior studies where amelioration of opioid -induced constipation was the primary endpoint). However, this will considerably increase sample size, and a dose higher than the FDA -approved doses may be associated with more adverse effects. We therefore elected to test two FDA- approved doses of naloxegol, to achieve the best possible balance between improving the chances of identifying possible activity against tumor progression, while maintaining tolerability/safety and limiting the total sample size. 1.7 Basic and pre -clinical studies Studies in animal models Pre-clinical studies from our group and others have shown that morphine and other opioids, in clinically relevant doses, promote cancer growth and metastasis by stimulating pro -angiogenic, survival - and growth - promoting signaling in endothelium.1,31,32 We also showed that chronic morphine treatment stimulates angiogenesis, tumor growth and metastasis, and impairs survival, in mouse models of breast cancer.1,31 In a mouse model that spontaneously develops breast cancer and mimics the evolutionary spectrum o f human breast cancer, we found that morphine activates mast cells and lymphangiogenesis in the tumors, while promoting tumor progression and shortening survival. 33 The relevance of this finding is further supported by observations from our laboratory and others that the opioid receptor antagonists, including naloxone, inhibit breast cancer growth in rodents. 1,34-37 However, naloxone cannot be used clinically in this context because it antagonizes the analgesic effect of opioids. Studies in lung cancer Our group has shown that MORs and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are expressed and co- localized in advanced lung cancer, and that morphine induces RTK activation and signaling, leading to growth and spread of lung cancer cells.2 These human lung cancer cells, as well as primary lung adenocarcinomas showed significantly increased expression of MOR (mu opioid receptors) as compared to control Beas- 2B cells and normal lung tissue. Concurrently, complementary studies by members of our study team demonstrated that MOR silencing of Lewis lung carcinoma cells (LLC) led to decreased metastasis in mice, and that MOR knockout mice did not develop significant LLC tumor growth as compared to wild type mice. 4 Importantly, pharmacological treatment with methylnaltrexone (a PAMORA) inhibited LLC invasion in soft agar and LLC tumor volume and metastasis in mice.4 Subsequent studies by our study team showed that overexpression of MOR in human lung cancers promotes tumor growth and metastases in xenografts in mice. 38 More recent ly we showed that morphine, acting via MOR, upregulates multi -drug resistance to chemotherapeutic agents in human NSCLC cells; this effect is blocked by the PAMORA methylnaltrexone.13 Together, these preclinical data provide compelling evidence for the role of MOR in lung cancer progression and metastasis; and amelioration of lung cancer progression and metastasis with strategies utilizing inhibition of MOR including antagonism with a PAMORA. Taken together, these pre- clinical studies provide strong evidence that in animal models of several malignancies, activation of peripheral MORs (on endothelial cells and tumors, not in the CNS), by clinically used opioid medications, promotes tumor progression via several different mechanisms including Stat3, MAPK/ERK and Akt phosphorylation, nitric oxide synthesis, COX -2 activation, PGE2 production, cross -activation of EGFR and VEGF -R2, substance P (SP) and mast cell activation.14,31-33,38-42 Notably, these mechanisms play a central role in cancer progression as well a s nociception. More recently, Suzuki et al. have shown that the peripheral opioid receptor antagonist methylnaltrexone augments the antineoplastic activity of the"

The effects of pain, opioid requirement, and known prognostic variables on outcomes were analyzed in univariable and multivariable models. Both the severity of chronic pain and greater opioid requirement after starting chemotherapy were strongly associated with shorter OS by univariate analysis. The survival of patients experiencing lower levels of chronic pain and requiring lower doses of opioids (LPLO group) w as markedly longer than the survival of patients experiencing higher levels of chronic pain and/or requiring higher doses of opioids in the period from starting chemotherapy until death/last follow up (median overall survival, 16.4 vs ~7 months, p ≤ 0.001) . Remarkably, the level of pain experienced and opioid analgesics required during the first 3 months after diagnosis were strongly predictive of survival. Patients in the LPLO group during the first 3 months after starting chemotherapy had nearly 12 months longer median survival compared to the other 3 groups: 17.9 months vs. 5.7 months (severe pain but low opioid requirement), 6.5 months (low pain but high opioid requirement), and 6.2 months (severe pain and high opioid requirement), log -rank p = 0.002. In multivariable models, longer survival in the LPLO group was sustained after adjustment for known prognostic factors including age, stage and performance status. In various malignancies, at least 3 prospective studies suggest that endogenous or pharmacolog ical opioids may promote cancer progression in patients with astrocytomas, 45 pancreatic cancer46 and various advanced solid tumors.47 More recently, we found that opioid exposure during the first 3 months after first treatment in 1,386 patients with stage IV non- hematologic malignancies (largest subgroup [~ 40%] lung cancer) was independently predictive of overall survival (P < 0.0001).48 Several additional retrospective clinical studies from our group and others have reported that (1) human lung cancers e xpress opioid receptors,3 (2) opioid receptor expression is greater in metastatic lesions compared to the primary tumor,49 and (3) opioid exposure is associated with tumor progression/recurrence and shorter survival.50,51 Importantly, a recent study showed that administration of a PAMORA to patients with advanced malignancies was associated with a significantly lower rate of tumor progression compared to placebo (13.8% vs 25.4% respectively; P = 0.03). 52 Further, pain itself increases the levels of circul ating endogenous opioids (e.g. endorphins). It is therefore possible that even in patients who are not receiving pharmacological opioid medications, elevated levels of endogenous opioids may themselves activate peripheral MORs and cross -activate signaling pathways that influence tumor progression. This mechanism may be responsible for the known adverse prognostic effect of pain in malignancies including prostate cancer, 53-57 NSCLC58 and other malignancies.59"
13,page_13,"Alliance A221504 14 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 The above observations raise the possibility tha t inhibiting the activity of opioids on peripheral opioid receptors by a PAMORA medication may improve HRQoL by mitigating both the symptoms related to tumor progression and the peripheral adverse effects of opioids. Figure 1 Panels from Fig. 1 in Belani et al. 2012,10 showing the time to worsening (TWS) of pain and overall quality of life (QoL) in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving maintenance pemetrexed (blue/lighter lines) or placebo (red/darker lines). In these figures, TWS is shown from the date of randomization to maintenance pemetrexed or placebo. Randomization to maintenance was preceded by platinum -based induction chemotherapy given over approximately 3 months. TWS for pain occurred at a median of 6.1 (95% CI: 4.6 – 9.6) months and TWS for overall QoL occurred at a median of 5.8 (95% CI: 4.4 – 8.4) months in patients receiving maintenance pemetrexed. The corresponding durations were 4.6 (95% CI: 3.3 – 6.0) and 3.7 (3.0 – 5.5) months respectively in patients on the placebo arm who did not re ceive maintenance pemetrexed. 1.8 Naloxegol and other PAMORAs Clinically, PAMORAs are well known to ameliorate opioid -induced constipation mediated by peripheral opioid receptors, without compromising the analgesic effect of opioids mediated by central opi oid receptors.13 In short -term studies in healthy volunteers, these drugs also reduce morphine- induced peripheral adverse effects including nausea, pruritis and flushing, as well as a composite score of these and other adverse effects.25,26 The PAMORA methylnaltrexone i s effective in relieving opioid -induced constipation in terminally ill patients with diverse advanced malignancies, and intermediate- term (up to 4 months) administration is well tolerated without inducing opioid withdrawal or worsening of pain.61,62 A rece nt post -hoc analysis suggests that PAMORAs may also ameliorate tumor progression in humans.52 Of the PAMORAs, naloxegol (PEGylated naloxone; Movantik®) is the only oral agent approved by the FDA for prolonged treatment of opioid -induced constipation in non- cancer patients.27 Naloxegol needs to be administered only once a day by mouth, does not adversely affect the analgesic effects of opioids, and is generally well tolerated with adverse effects largely"

Secondary hypothesis : Activation of peripheral opioid receptors promotes cancer progression and mediates the distressing side effects of opioid medications, together leading to worsening of disease -related symptoms and impairment of HRQoL. Selective inhibition of peripheral opioid receptors will improve HRQoL by ameliorating both these undesirable effects of opioid receptor activation (tumor progression and peripheral adverse effects), without compromising analgesia (which is mediated by central opioid receptors, i.e. in the CNS). 1.10 How this pilot study will provide essential d ata for a future, more definitive study, and its possible design: Information that needs to be generated from the currently proposed pilot study in order to proceed to a phase II or III trial: (a) best dose of naloxegol to use , (b) tolerability/safety and feasibility information , (c) ideally, suggestions of efficacy pertaining to HRQoL (from inhibition of tumor progression and amelioration of opioid peripheral adverse effects). (a) It is possible that the optimal dose of naloxegol for relieving constipation may be different from the dose that effectively inhibits opioid receptors in advanced NSCLC. If both FDA - approved doses of naloxegol induce an equally significant beneficial effect, we will choose the lower (12.5 mg/day) dose for a subsequent study. If the higher dose (25 mg/day) demonstrates greater efficacy without causing a significant increase in toxicity, we will select that dose. (b) Since this will be a pilot study of a relatively recently approved medication, we chose to include a co- primary endpoint of safety and feasibility. Acceptable levels of the feasibility endpoints (accrual rate ≥ 80% of target and ≥ 80% of patients alive at 6 months remaining on study for at least 6 months) are specified in the study design (below ). The duration of tr eatment with the study drug/placebo will be 2 years, since the primary endpoints will be reached by this time and because this period will be beyond the expected median survival of 13 -17 months for the study population. (c) Naloxegol is likely to influence HRQoL by reducing the adverse peripheral effects of opioid analgesics, particularly constipation, and perhaps nausea, vomiting or other adverse effects. We therefore expect that physical well -being and functional well -being will be most likely to be impro ved by use of this drug. HRQoL may be further improved if tumor progression is slowed, and therefore all aspects of HRQoL could be positively affected. In this study, we therefore want to observe that administration of naloxegol is associated with a genera lly accepted magnitude of clinically meaningful improvement (change in TOI score at 6 months11; FACT -L; Appendix VI ) that naloxegol improves HRQoL items listed in Appendix V (e.g. dry mouth, urinary symptoms, increased sweating, or vomiting etc.,) more than placebo, and that naloxegol results in less constipation than placebo ( Appendix III )."
15,page_15,"Alliance A221504 16 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 The design of a future phase II or III study will largely depend on the above aspects.

Paraffin blocks of diagnostic tumor tissue (from primary or metastatic site) should be sent to the Alliance Biorepository at Mayo Clinic FFPE Tissue. The Alliance has instituted special considerations for the small percentage of hospitals whose policy prohibits long -term storage of blocks, and the smaller percentage of hospitals whose policies prohibit release of any block. If, due to institutional policy, a block cannot be sent then please send slides of diagnostic tumor tissue. The goal of the Alliance Biorepository is to provide investigators with quality histology sections for their research while maintaining the integrity of the tissue. For these reasons it is preferred that the Alliance Biorepository bank the block until the study investigator reques ts thin sections. Please contact the Alliance Biorepository if additional assurances with your hospital pathology department are required. If an institution is unable to provide a tissue block, please submit either of the following: 10 unstained PLUS -charged glass slides (or as many as possible if fewer than 10) of 4 -6 micron thick sections from: • The most recent diagnostic biopsy confirming advanced (stage IIIB/IV) non-small cell carcinoma of the lung OR • A diagnostic biopsy (or surgery) performed previously, if the patient was previously diagnosed and/or treated for the same malignancy (i.e., early stage non-small cell carcinoma of the lung) and has now progressed or relapsed OR • A fine needle aspiration (FNA) or cell block, if only a FNA or bronchoscopic washings were performed (or found to contain diagnostic material). Label the unstained slides with Alliance patient ID number, accession number, and order of sections via institution’s standard method for labeling clinical slides or using a permanent m arker. Please DO NOT use sticky labels. Tissue sample should be sent within 7 days after registration. A de -identified surgical pathology report should be sent with tumor tissues (blocks or unstained slides). Usually, this is generated by obscuring all PHI (names and dates) with white- out or a black magic marker, labeling each page of the report with the Alliance patient ID, and photocopying the report."

Laxatives/stool softeners/fiber can be restarted and used as needed if constipation persists for three or more days after starting naloxegol/placebo. Advanced lung cancer is considered to be incurable, and patients with progressive disease often experience increasing pain that requires treatment with escalating doses of opioids. Since the objective of this study is to examine whether naloxegol can mitigate the adverse effects of opioids, the study drug should be continued for as long as possible for up to 2 years. Recommendations for missed doses: If a patient vomits, there is a possibility that some of the dose may already have been absorbed. Another dose must NOT be administered the same day. The patient should take the following day’s dose at the correct time on the next day. Similarly, if a patient has forgotten a dose, it may be reasonable for them to take it if only a few hours have elapsed since the scheduled time, but skip that day’s dose if it has been many hours. 7.2 First -line systemic therapy . The choice of first -line systemic therapy , number of cycles to be administered, and whether or not maint enance treatment is used, will be at the discretion of the treating physician. Systemic therapy may include chemotherapy with/without immunotherapy (e.g. pembrolizumab) or anti-angiogenic agents (e.g. bevacizumab), immunotherapy alone, or other agents. 7.3 Opioids The use of standard opioids (and other analgesics) to control pain adequately will be permitted at the discretion of the treating physician. While patients are receiving naloxegol/placebo, the use of mixed opioid agonists/antagonists or other opioid antagonists will not be permitted (e.g. pentazocine, buprenorphine, nalbuphine, naloxone and other naloxone containing products such as oxycodone/naloxone combinations [e.g., Targin®], naltrexone and other naltrexone containing products such as morphine/naltrexone combinations [e.g., Embeda®], methylnaltrexone [Relistor®], or alvimopan [Entereg®]). Patients who have used such drugs in the past will not be eligible for this study. Additionally, since patients receiving methadone may experience a higher f requency of GI adverse effects possibly related to opioid withdrawal upon administration of naloxegol, the use of methadone while patients are receiving naloxegol/placebo will not be permitted .

PRO- CTCAE data should not be used for determining dose modifications. 8.2.1 Abdominal Pain If patients develop unusually severe, persistent or worsening ≥ grade 2 abdominal pain or other symptoms/signs of GI perforation or obstruction, naloxegol/placebo will be temporarily held and patients will be advised to obtain urgent medical attention. 8.2.2 Hepatotoxicity For grade 2 or higher (ALT or AST > 3 x ULN) hepatotoxicity, patients will be evaluated clinically. Naloxegol/placebo will be temporarily held for patients who develop any of the following: • Grade 2 ALT or AST > 3 -5 x ULN AND any of the following: Grade 2 or higher total bilirubin (> 1.5 x ULN) Grade 2 or higher INR (> 1.5) Symptoms including fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain/tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia. • Grade 3 or higher ALT or AST (> 5 x ULN) Naloxegol/placebo may be resumed for patients who recover to ≤ grade 2 ALT or AST (≤ 5 x ULN), ≤ grade 1 bilirubin and INR, and have no symptoms or signs of liver dysfunction. All patients developing liver dysfunction should be monitored clinically and wit h serial laboratory tests, as clinically appropriate. 8.2.3 Diarrhea, nausea or vomiting An assessment of whether these symptoms are related to systemic therapy or to naloxegol/placebo must be made. For grade 2 or higher nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, bel ieved to be at least possibly related to the study drug , naloxegol/placebo will be held temporarily. Naloxegol/placebo may be resumed with the original treatment schedule once these symptoms have improved to grade 1 or better. At the treating physician’s discretion, anti -diarrheal and anti -emetics can be used prophylactically to prevent another episode of grade 2- 4 symptoms. If grade 2 or higher"

Naloxegol/placebo will be resumed with the original treatment schedule once toxicity has improved to grade ≤ 1. If toxicity of grade 2- 4 recurs, the naloxegol/placebo will be permanently discontinued. Patients will be taken off protocol treatment if they are unable to resume naloxegol/placebo for ≥ 4 weeks because of persistent grade 2 -4 toxicity that is possibly/probably/definitely related to the study drug/placebo. If patients develop symptomatic brain metastases during the study (while patients are taking the study drug), it will be recommended that the study drug be temporarily withheld until 7 days after the end of radiation therapy, or until after recovery from brain surgery/resection of brain metastases. If patients develop leptomeningeal carcinomatosis during the study, the study drug will be discontinued permanently. 8.2.5 Pregnancy: Naloxegol/placebo will be discontinued immediately and permanently for any patient who becomes pregnant during the treatment period of the study. 8.2.6 Chemotherapy Dose adjustments and cycle delays for the individual chemotherapeutic agents used will be per institutional guidelines/practice and the package inserts. 8.3 Unblinding Procedures Unblinding can be done only in cases of an emergency. Follow the directions below to unblind patient treatment. Please note that if a treatment assignment is unblinded, the patient must discontinue protocol therapy. Emergency Unblinding Procedures: Examples of emergencies include 1) a life- threatening unexpected adverse event that is at least possibly related to the investigational agent and for which unblinding would influence treatment decisions; or 2) medication error, such as accidental overdose. Expected adverse events are listed in the “Toxicities” section below.

After the Executive Officer deems unblinding is warranted, the treatment assignment will be provided to the contact person at the treating site. Procedures for unblinding after completion of treatment with naloxegol/placebo Study participants can be unblinded after 2 years of treatment with naloxegol/placebo and all appropriate study forms have been completed. To receive patient treatment assignment in either of these cases, contact the Alliance Registration Office at during regular business hours. 9.0 A DVERSE EVENTS The prompt reporting of adverse events is the responsibility of each investigator engaged in clinical research, as required by Federal Regulations. Adverse events must be described and graded using the terminology and grading categories defined in the NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0. However, CT CAE v5.0 must be used for serious AE reporting through CTEP -AERS as of April 1, 2018. The CTCAE is available at . Attribution to protocol treatment for each adverse event must be determined by the investigator and reported on the required forms. Please refer the NCI Guidelines: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements for further details on AE reporting proce dures. NOTE: PRO- CTCAE data should not be used for determining attribution, or reporting of adverse events. 9.1 Routine adverse event reporting Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial are done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled in the studies as well as those who will enroll in future studies using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled times according to the study calendar in Section 5.0. For this trial, the Adverse Event Solicited form is used for routine AE reporting in Rave. Solicited Adv erse Events: The following adverse events are considered ""expected"" and their presence/absence should be solicited, and severity graded, at baseline and for each cycle of treatment by CTCAE, PRO -CTCAE, or both.

Alliance investigators are required to notify the Alliance Central Protocol Operations Program, the Study Chair, and their Institutional Review Board if a patient has a reportable serious ad verse event. The descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5 will be utilized for AE reporting. The CTCAE is identified and located on the CTEP website at: . All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE. All reactions determined to be “reportable” in an expedited manner must be reported using the Cancer Therapy Eva luation Program Adverse Event Reporting System (CTEP -AERS). For further information on the NCI requirements for SAE reporting, please refer to the ‘NCI Guidelines for Investigators: Adverse Event Reporting Requirements’ document published by the NCI. PRO -CTCAE data should not be used for determining attribution, or reporting of serious adverse events. Note: All deaths on study require both routine and expedited reporting regardless of causality. Attribution to treatment or other cause should be provided."

Additional Instructions or Exclusion to CTEP -AERS Expedited Reporting Requirements • All adverse events reported via CTEP -AERS (i.e., serious adverse events) should also be forwarded to your local IRB. • Grade 3/4 hematosuppression and hospitalization resulting from such do not require CTEP - AERS, but should be submitted as part of study results. All other grade 3, 4, or 5 adverse events that precipitate hospitalization or prolong an existing hospitalization must be reported via CTEP- AERS. • Reporting of cases of secondary AML/MDS is to be done using the NCI/CTEP Secondary AML/MDS Report Form. New primary malignancies should be reported using Form Notice of New Primary. • Death due to progressive disease should be reported as Grade 5 “Disease progression” in the system organ class (SOC) “General disorders and administration site conditions.” Evidence that the death was a manifestation of underlying disease (e.g., radiological changes sug gesting tumor growth or progression: clinical deterioration associated with a disease process) should be submitted. • All new malignancies must be reported via CTEP -AERS whether or not they are thought to be related to either previous or current treatment. All new malignancies should be reported, i.e. solid tumors (including non -melanoma skin malignancies), hematologic malignancies, myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelogenous leukemia, and in situ tumors. Secondary Malignancy: A secondary malignancy is a cancer caused by treatment for a previous malignancy (e.g., treatment with investigational agent/intervention, radiation or chemotherapy). A secondary malignancy is not considered a metastasis of the initial neoplasm. CTEP requ ires all secondary malignancies that occur following treatment with an agent under an NCI IND/IDE be reported via CTEP- AERS. Three options are available to describe the event: • Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy (e.g., acute myelocytic leukemia [AML]) • Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) • Treatment -related secondary malignancy Any malignancy possibly related to cancer treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting mechanisms outlined in each protocol."

Naloxegol contains naloxegol oxalate as the active ingredient. Naloxegol is an antagonist of opioid binding at the mu -opioid receptor which functions as a peripherally -acting mu -opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA) in tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract, thereby decreasing the constipating effects of opioids. The PEG moiety reduces its passive permeabil ity. It is a substrate for the P -glycoprotein transporter (P -gp). Due to reduced permeability and increased P-gp mediated efflux across the blood- brain barrier, CNS penetration is negligible. Naloxegol therefore does not antagonize centrally mediated opioid analgesia. No antidote is known for naloxegol. Dialysis was ineffective as a means of elimination in a clinical study in patients with renal failure. Patients who have received an overdose of the study drug should be monitored closely for potential evidence of opioid withdrawal symptoms such as chills, rhinorrhea, diaphoresis or reversal of central analgesic effect. Treatment should be based on the degree of opioid withdrawal symptoms, including changes in blood pressure and heart rate, and on the need for analgesia. Procurement Naloxegol will be provided by Astra Zeneca and distributed by the Alliance Research Base Pharmacy. The pharmacy will deliver patient- specific supplies of 18 tablets per bottle, and patients will be provided with a 3 month supply of five bottles containing 12.5 mg tablets and another five bottles containing 25 mg tablets at a time. Sites should not repackage bottles within the kit, and drug should be dispensed in the original bottles."

41,page_41,"Alliance A221504 42 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 Patients should avoid consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit juice. Drug Interactions Concomitant use of naloxegol is not r ecommended with the following classes of medications: Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, ketoconazole [except topical use], cyclosporine, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, itraconazole, verapamil) Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, erythromycin, verapamil) Strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin) Opioid antagonists and mixed agonists/antagonists. EXAMPLES of such medications include: pentazocine, buprenorphine, nalbuphine, naloxone and other naloxone containing products such as oxycodone/naloxone combinations [e.g., Targin®], naltrexone and other naltrexone containing products such as morphine/naltrexone combinations [e.g., Embeda®], methylnaltrexone [Relistor®], or alvimopan [Entereg®]). Pharmacokinetics Absorption: rapid. With a high fat meal, C max and AUC increase by 30% and 45% respectively. Distribution: V d 968-2140 L. Protein binding: Low at approximately 4.2%. Metabolism: Primarily hepatic via CYP3A4. Half-life: 6 -11 hours. Excretion: primarily fecal (68%, approximately 16% as unchanged drug); urinary (16%, <6% as unchanged drug). Adverse Events Warnings/Precautions : Gastrointestinal Perforation: Gastrointestinal perforation has been reported with another peripherally acting opioid antagonist in patients with conditions associated with compromised structural integrity of the gastrointestinal tract wall. Monitor for the development of severe, persistent or worsening abdominal pain; discontinue study drug and obtain urgent medical evaluation of patients who develop this sympto m. Opioid Withdrawal: Hyperhidrosis, chills, diarrhea, abdominal pain, anxiety, irritability, and yawning have occurred in patients treated with naloxegol. Patients receiving methadone have a higher frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions possibly related to opioid withdrawal, compared to patients receiving other opioids. Patients having disruptions to the blood-brain barrier may be at increased risk for opioid withdrawal or reduced analgesia. Monitor for symptoms of opioid withdrawal, particularly in such patients. Adverse events: >10%: GI: Abdominal pain 1%-10%: Central Nervous System: Headache Dermatologic: Hyperhidrosis GI: Diarrhea, nausea, flatulence, vomiting Table 1 lists adverse reactions in pooled data from clinical studies in non -cancer patients receiving naloxegol for opioid -induced constipation, and occurring in ≥ 3% of patients receiving 12.5 mg or 25 mg naloxegol and at an incidence greater than placebo."

Patient should be reminded to take naloxegol/placebo at least one hour before a meal or at least two hours afterwards. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should be avoided while on naloxegol/placebo. The patient medication diary should be explained to the patient and caregiver with instructions to note time/date of administration of naloxegol/placebo each day. The level and incidence of pain should be noted on the Pain and Pain Medication Diary using a s cale of 0 -10. Patients should be instructe d to call the site coordinator whenever a new drug is ordered, especially if the provider is outside of the cancer center and not fully aware of the study requirements and limitations. In the event of hospital admission, the study coordinator should monitor any new drugs to avoid undesirable interactions. Patients should be instructed to call the site coordinator with any concerns. Ideally, a 24 -hour number should be provided to the patient. In the event that a 3- week interval visit is missed by the patient , the site coordinator can call the patient and obtain responses to the questionnaire(s) items OR discuss mailing the self -reported questionnaires with a stamped, returned envelope for return. 10.2 Placebo A matching placebo will be provided by Astra Zene ca. It will match the active naloxegol 12.5 and 25 mg tablets in size, shape and color. The placebo tablets contain mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate. The coating material contains hypromellose, iron oxide/ferric oxide (red, black and yellow), macrogols/polyethylene glycol and titanium dioxide. 11.0 H EALTH OUTCOMES MEASURES Each questionnaire administered in this study is described below. These self -reported questionnaires are expected to take less than 15 minutes for completi on and be minimally burdensome. In the event that the patient is unable to complete the questionnaires, the local study coordinator may help the patient. Patients appreciate being asked about their symptoms on such questionnaires, and usually do not find t hem difficult or inconvenient to fill out. 74 11.1 FACT -L The FACT -L75 includes the FACT -G [version 4.0], developed by Cella et al76 as an overall cancer -specific HRQoL questionnaire, with a 9- item subscale concerning specific lung cancer issues. The FACT -G consists of a self -report 28- item HRQoL measure grouped into four subscales: physical well -being (PWB), social/family well- being (SFWB), emotional well -being"
43,page_43,"Alliance A221504 44 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 (EWB), and functional well -being (FWB). Most items are rated on a 5 -point Likert scale, from 0, 'not at all' to 4, 'very much'. When the Lung Cancer Subscale (LCS) is added to FACT -G, 9 additional items focus on symptoms and issues more specific to lung cancer patients. The FACT - L will be scored according to the published scoring algorithm and following endpoints computed at each time point: FACT -L (PWB + SFWB + EWB + FWB + LCS), Trial Outcome Index (TOI; PWB + FWB + LCS), PWB, SFWB, EWB, FWB, and LCS. Higher scores indicate better HRQoL. Minimum clinically meaningful change in TOI and LCS scores hav e been determined11 and will be used as a guide to assess the effect observed in this trial. See Section 13.0 and Appendix VI. The focus of the secondary objective is to estimate the difference in HRQoL (TOI, FACT -L) improvement at 6 months from baseline between the study drug and placebo. However, collecting HRQoL data beyond 6 months (until the end of the 2 year study period) will allow us to explore the effect of treatment on long -term HRQoL . HRQoL data collected beyond 6 months will be summarized and compared, using similar methods described for change in HRQoL at 6 months (See Section 13.4.2). This exploratory analysis may inform the design of future randomized long- term studies. 11.2 PRO -CTCAEs and urinary hesitancy question The standard mechanism for reporting toxicities in cancer research has been clinician -only reporting using items from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAEs). Recently , the NCI has developed a patient- reported version of the CTCAE called the Patient -Reported Outcome -CTCAE (PRO -CTCAE). The PRO -CTCAE is a library of questions asking patients about specific symptomatic adverse events associated with cancer therapy, such as constipation or nausea. In multiple studies, PRO -CTCAE measures have improved the predictive accuracy of clinician CTCAE reporting. In a prospective study including lung cancer patients PRO measurements of toxicities better reflected patients’ underlying state and functional status than clinicians’ evaluations. 77 For this study, we will use selected PRO -CTCAE items to assess the following symptoms: abdominal pain (3 PRO -CTCAE questions), headache (3 PRO -CTCAE questions), hyperhidrosis (sweating, 2 PRO -CTCAE questions ), diarrhea (1 PRO -CTCAE question), nausea (2 PRO- CTCAE questions), flatulence (gas; 1 PRO -CTCAE question), vomiting (2 PRO - CTCAE questions) and dry mouth (1 PRO -CTCAE question). These items will be included in the questionnaires that patients complete at the same time as CTCAE assessments and a urinary hesitancy question, every 3 weeks for the first year, then every 3 months during year 2 . The urinary hesitancy question (a visual analogue scale from 0 -10 with 0 representing no symptom and 10 r epresenting a symptom as bad as imaginable) is necessary because there are no PRO - CTCAE items that measure this symptom adequately. Summary statistics will be generated regarding change in PRO -CTCAE responses and change in urinary hesitancy scores over tim e in the three arms of the study. See Appendix V. 11.3 Bowel function -diary (BF -Diary) Constipation will be assessed using modified versions of modules 1 and 2 of the bowel function-diary (BF -Diary) 78 prior to start of treatment and every 3 weeks (+/ -7 days). See Section 5.0 and Appendix IV. 11.4 Pain and analgesic use Pain and analgesic use will be assessed via a self -report daily medication/pain diary that patients will be asked to complete every day at home and bring to all study -related visits. See Sec tion 5.0. See Appendix I."

Naloxegol/placebo wi ll NOT be discontinued for disease progression. After 2 years of protocol treatment, patients may be unblinded per Section 8.3 and initiate open- label naloxegol treatment at the discretion of the treating physician. 12.1.2 Discontinuation of study agent: If the patient discontinues naloxegol/placebo, he/she should be followed for disease progression and survival by telephone or cli nic visit every 3 months until 2 years after the date of registration. Submission of QOL booklets after discontinuation of naloxegol/placebo is not required. 12.2 Managing ineligible patients and registered patients who never receive protocol intervention Definition of ineligible patient A study patient who is registered to the trial but does not meet all of the eligibility criteria is deemed to be ineligible. Follow -up for ineligible patients who continue with protocol treatment Patients who are deemed ineligible after registering may co ntinue protocol treatment, provided the treating physician, study chair, and executive officer agree there are no safety concerns if the patient continues protocol treatment. All scans, tests, and data submission are to continue as if the patient were elig ible. Notification of the local IRB may be necessary per local IRB policies. Follow -up for ineligible patients who discontinue protocol treatment For patients who are deemed ineligible after registering to the trial, who start treatment, but then discontinue study treatment, the same data submission requirements are to be followed as for those patients who are eligible and who discontinue study treatment. Follow -up for patients who are registered, but who never start study treatment For all study patients w ho are registered to the trial but who never receive study intervention (regardless of eligibility), the follow -up requirements are specified below. Baseline and off -treatment notice data submission required. See the Data Submission Schedule accompanying the All Forms Packet. 12.3 Extraordinary Medical Circumstances If, at any time the constraints of this protocol are detrimental to the patient's health and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, protocol therapy shall be discontinued. In this event: • Document the reason(s) for discontinuation of therapy on data forms. • Follow the patient for protocol endpoints as required by the Study Calendar. 13.0 S TATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 13.1 Study Overview This is a randomized, double blind, placebo -controlled, three -arm pilot study primarily designed to determine the safety and feasibility of the PAMORA naloxegol and to determine the optimal"
45,page_45,"Alliance A221504 46 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 of two FDA -approved doses of the study drug. Patients will be randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio to either one of the two doses of naloxegol or placebo. 13.2 Sample Size, Accrual Time and Study Duration 13.2.1 Sample Size As this is a pilot study to assess feasibility and safety, it is not powered to test specific hypothesis. We plan to enroll a total of 204 patients, 68 patients per arm. Assuming approximately 10% of patients will be ineligible due to cancellation or major violations leading to a total 184 patients (61 per arm) evaluable for the primary endpoints of feasibility and safety. Among patients with advanced NSCLC, 0%, 25% and 33% of those receiving < 6, 6 – 8, and > 8 cycles discontinued pemetrexed + carboplatin induction chemotherapy for toxicity, respectively. 79 In phase III studies, deaths attributable to drug toxicity occurred in 1% and 0.3% patients during the induction and maintenance therapy phases, respectively. 17,18 About 75% of all patients who start pemetrexed- based chemotherapy for NSCLC are expected to be alive at 6 months.17 Thus, we would like to observe that ≥ 80% of 75%, corresponding to ≥ 60% of all patients enrolled, continue on naloxegol/placebo for at least 6 months (the time point on which the change in Trial Outcome Index (TOI) of the FACT -L [secondary endpoint] will also be calculated). We will evaluate the safety of the naloxegol/placebo in NSCLC patients receiving systemic therapy by looking at the incidence of adverse events according to CTCAE criteria, including potentially expected and unexpected toxicities, and study drug vs placebo discontinuation rates, between the study arms. Although the study is not powered to test specific hypotheses regarding HRQoL, the focus of the secondary objective of the study is to estimate the difference in HRQoL improvement at 6 months from baseline between the study treatment and placebo. Assuming 75% of patients will be alive at 6 months and 80% of these patients will return completed forms, we expect 111 patients (37 per arm) to be evaluable for this endpoint. The margin of err or of a 90% two- sided confidence interval with this sample size is .38 SD. Cella et al. 11 reported that, in patients with advanced NSCLC receiving standard chemotherapy, the minimal Clinically Meaningful Change (CMC) size was 5 -6 points (effect size, 0.14 – 0.45 SD) on the TOI and 2- 3 points (effect size, 0.23 – 0.66 SD) on the LCS of the FACT -L, which correlated closely with changes in the disease status (objective response vs progression; early vs late progression). Using the SD reported in Cella et al. 11, the margin of error of .38 SD is equivalent to a difference of 5.7 points (SD = ~15 points) in TOI and 2 points (SD = 5 points) in LCS. Therefore, an observed improvement of 5.7 points or higher in TOI (or 2 points or higher in LCS) in one of the naloxegol arms when compared to the placebo arm suggests a benefit in favor of naloxegol. This sample size allows estimation with sufficient precision to detect a moderate effect size that falls within the published CMC range. 13.2.2 Accrual Rate and Accrual Du ration We anticipate accruing approximately 9 – 10 patients per month, based on our previous experience in clinical practice. This would mean completing the primary accrual within 20 – 22 months from study initiation. 13.2.3 Primary Endpoint Completion Date for ClinicalTrials.gov Reporting For purpose of ClinicalTrial.gov reporting, the Primary Endpoint Completion Date (PECD) for this study is the time the last patient registered has been followed for at least one day."

HRQoL scores at each timepoint and changes in scores between 6 months and baseline will be summarized by mean (SD), median (inter -quartile range). Scores will be plotted to explore the pattern over time and to examine differences between treatment arms. Differences in HRQoL between the treatment arms and the placebo arm will be conducted through linear mixed models and growth curve models to account for repeated assessments.

Because of exploratory nature, we will not adjust for multiple comparisons. The frequency and pattern of missing data will be summarized descriptively and sensitivity analyses will only be performed if the over all missing rate is more than 10% and most missing data are deemed not at random. Sensitivity analyses are composed of simple imputation, multiple imputations, and pattern mixture models and selection models. HRQoL data beyond 6 months (until the end of the 2 year study period) will allow us to explore the effect of treatment on long -term HRQoL. HRQoL data collected beyond 6 months will be summarized and compared, using similar methods described for change in HRQoL at 6 months. This exploratory analysis may inform the design of future randomized long- term studies. 2) PRO- CTCAE and Urinary hesitancy items will be summarized by arm. PRO -CTCAE response will be compared between the treatment arms vs. placebo arm using a chi -square test or Fishe r’s exact test as appropriate.

PFS time is defined as the time from randomization to disease progression/relapse, death, or loss to follow -up whichever occurs first. Progression will be assessed using the standard RECIST 1.1 criteria. Patient who are alive and disease- free at the end of study will be censored at that time point. PFS probabilities will be estimated by arm using the Kaplan -Meier estimator. In an exploratory manner, a Cox proportional hazards model will be used to determine the effect of naloxegol on PFS. Adjustment for known prognostic factors (age, sex, stage [IIIB vs IV], smoking status [non -smoker or light smoker vs heavy smoker]) will be included in the model if feasible. The model will be stratified by ECOG PS and planned use of bevacizu mab. 7) The event for OS is death from any cause. OS time is defined as the time from randomization to death or loss to follow -up whichever occurs first. Patient who are alive at the end of the study will be censored at that time point. OS will be analy zed in the same manner as PFS. 8) MOR expression and activation will be included as a covariate in the linear mixed model from the analysis described in 13.4.2 1. An interaction between MOR expression/activation and treatment will be evaluated. 13.5 Study Monitoring 13.5.1 Adverse Event Stopping Rule The stopping rule specified below is based on the knowledge available at study development.

50,page_50,"Alliance A221504 51 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 14.0 C ORRELATIVE AND COMPANION STUDIES There will be 1 substudy and all patients are encouraged to participate. 14.1 Biological mechanism of action, and biomarkers that would predict response/risk to the study drug 14.1.1 Background Biological end -points based on our hypothesis will be evaluat ed in tumor biopsies and plasma, pre -treatment and plasma post- treatment. For practical reasons, obtaining post - treatment biopsies may not be feasible in this multi -center study. The hypothesis to be addressed is that high mu opioid receptors (MOR) in the tumors co- activates receptor tyrosine kinases for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) -2 (on endothelium) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the tumor cells and downstream signaling pathways of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) that promote cell proliferation and survival, respectively, and cyclo -oxygenase (COX) -2 signaling, leading to tumor progression and impairment of HRQoL. We anticipate that tumors with higher mu opioid receptor expres sion will show more responsiveness to naloxegol treatment and/or tumors with lower mu opioid receptor expression may show slower growth on their own. Thus, tumors with higher mu opioid receptors will show a correlative increase in the phosphorylation of en dothelial VEGFR2, EGFR on endothelial/tumor cells, MAPK/ERK and Akt, Stat3 and increased COX - 2/prostaglandin (PG) -E2 in association with higher cell proliferation (by proliferating cell nuclear antigen: PCNA) and cell survival (TUNEL staining) indices. Pain can influence pro- inflammatory and vasoactive neuropeptide substance P (SP), which can promote tumor growth -specific effects such as vascular permeability and angiogenesis, which may be higher in patients with more pain in association with beta -endorphin, the endogenous ligand for MOR. The levels of beta- endorphin and substance SP in the plasma will therefore correlate with increased MOR in the tumor and with pain. In addition, since opioid receptors can also modulate angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, t hese would correlate with MOR and opioid use and beta-endorphin levels. 14.1.2 Objectives The main objective of the correlative science studies is to examine if MOR expression or activation is a prognostic marker in advanced NSCLC, and whether its expressi on/activation can be used to guide pain management. To examine this, the correlative studies will examine if any potential beneficial effect of selective peripheral MOR inhibition by naloxegol on HRQoL is limited to, or greater in, patients: • Whose tumors demonstrate a higher level of MOR expression/activation • With higher circulating levels of endogenous opioids, or • Those requiring higher doses (≥5 mg/day average oral morphine equivalents [OME]) of pharmacological opioids We will assess the mechanism of the study drug’s impact by analyzing whether the HRQoL differences between the arms are greatest: 1) in patients with higher than the median MOR expression on their tumors; 2) in those with higher than the median circulating endogenous opioids; and 3) in thos e taking ≥ 5 mg/day average oral morphine at the start of the trial. If our hypothesis proves to be true, this line of investigation can be further advanced in future studies to use fresh biopsies for isolating tumor cells and endothelial cells for mechani sm based studies and can also be used in organ culture to determine the therapeutic potential of naloxegol on a case by case basis."
51,page_51,"Alliance A221504 52 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 14.1.3 Methods Expression of opioid receptors and correlative growth and survival -promoting signaling pathways in the tumor biopsies: We provide the staining strategy with an example of one set of staining. Four to six micron thick sections will be co -stained with the following primary antibodies: goat anti -human CD31 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:50 dilution to label blood vessels, mouse anti -human total or phospho EGFR (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) at 1:100, and rabbit anti-human MOR (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) at 1:100, followed by staining with species- specific secondary antibodies labeled with Cy2 (CD 31), Cy3 (EGFR), and Cy5 (MOR) (Jackson Immunoresearch, Westgrove, PA). z- stacks of 0.5 micron thick images will be acquired using LSCM (Olympus FluoView 1000 BX2, Olympus Corporation, Center Valley, PA) for all 3 markers in the same field of view (FOV) . MOR will be pseudo -colored green, EGFR red, and CD31 blue using Adobe Photoshop, and images from the same FOV will be merged to analyze for co -expression of molecular markers as described by us previously.2 Quantitative analysis of immunoreactive (ir) pixels for each marker: Each acquired image will be binarized and analyzed for immunoreactive pixels using Adobe Photoshop as described by us previously5 and expressed as ir pixels divided by total stained area. To reduce non- specific background all acquisitions will be thresholded similarly for a specific antibody. Data will be expressed as ir-pixels per FOV at a fixed magnification. Sets of markers exami ned will be as follows: CD31, MOR, phospho- VEGFR2, Total VEGFR2 CD31, MOR, phospho- EGFR, Total EGFR CD31, MOR, phospho- MAPK/ERK, Total MAPK/ERK CD31, MOR, phospho- Stat3, Total Stat3 (this set will be tested if adequate number of slides are available) Quan titative analysis of SP and beta-endorphin in the plasma: SP will be analyzed in heparinized plasma using competitive ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), using negative and positive controls with each set of analysis, as described by us.80 Levels of bet a-endorphin will be determined in EDTA -plasma, using competitive high sensitivity ELISA (Peninsula Laboratories International, Inc, San Carlos, CA). We have standardized this assay and recognize that it has to be run at least in duplicate on each sample fo r reproducibility. These methods have been standardized in the investigator’s laboratory using human and mouse plasma. Quality control assessments have been performed on human plasma, which will also be used while analyzing the plasma samples from this current study. Longitudinal studies on beta -endorphin and SP have been performed on the plasma of transgenic mice during cancer progression. These longitudinal studies have shown a significant correlation between tumor burden and the concentration of beta- endorphin in the plasma. Anticipated Problems and Alternative Strategies Limited number of slides or no biopsy slides (FNA) : In general, throughout the study we will stain for 3 markers/section. We will ask for 4-6 unstained slides per patient. Each slide wi ll be stained for 4 markers if fewer slides are available using our established immunofluorescent labeling techniques.2,33,81 To maximize the analytical output and minimize the effect of regional heterogeneity, 3 -5 different fields of view (FOV) will be imaged per section for each marker. All 4 markers per section will be analyzed in each FOV"
52,page_52,"Alliance A221504 53 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 and 2 sections will be stained per set of 4 markers. Therefore, with 4- 6 slides we will be able to analyze 8 -12 markers. However, based on our past experience with sim ilar studies,2-5 we realize the challenges involved in obtaining slides from limited tissue biopsies and/or FNA. In our previous study, biopsies from about 30 tumors analyzed for MOR immunoreactivity yielded significance in an analysis similar to that prop osed in the current study.5 In similar studies reported by other investigators, biopsies could not be available for analysis from all the patients, but significance could be achieved for the clinical correlations examined for intratumoral markers of hypoxi a and angiogenesis with respect to % freedom from biochemical failure against time in years.82 We anticipate analyzing 10 -12 markers, but in the event of limited availability we will limit our analysis to 6 -8 most important markers, namely MOR; phospho and total-EGFR, phospho and total -VEGFR2, and anti -CD31; and total and phospho- MAPK/ERK and -Stat3, which can be performed on 2 unstained slides . In cases where FNA is performed, we will request slides from the paraffin cell block , if available. Therefore, w e are cautiously optimistic of obtaining the targeted sample size for correlative analytical studies. Hemolysis : Another observation that we have made is occasionally blood samples are hemolyzed. The analysis using ELISA may be compromised on hemolyzed sam ples and they will need to be excluded from the study. To overcome this issue, we will examine the samples immediately upon arrival in the lab. If we find a hemolyzed sample, we will immediately contact the collecting center to consider the possibility of re-draw and replacing the sample. Exploratory outcomes: Measuring the circulating levels of beta- endorphin and SP is exploratory, but their translational potential is high for identifying novel markers of pain associated with tumor progression independently and also after opioid use. This is therefore a high risk, high reward analysis. It is based on our strong pre -clinical studies in cancer -bearing mice and in transgenic mice with sickle cell disease expressing human sickle hemoglobin, both of which exper ience constitutive chronic pain. 33, 81,83 Studies by other groups on sickle patients have clearly shown an increase in blood levels of SP in sickle patients at steady state as compared to ethnicity - and age -matched controls; as well as a further increase i n sickle patient’s blood during vaso- occlusive crises (VOC), a condition associated with acute severe pain.84 In our mouse studies, sickle mice showed significantly increased blood levels of SP at steady state compared to control mice expressing normal human hemoglobin A. Upon treatment with imatinib, cromolyn sodium, cannabinoids and an investigational drug (AT200), SP levels decreased significantly, and correlated with decreased pain following these treatments. 80,85 Complementary to these observations, tr ansgenic breast cancer bearing mice showed increased SP expression in the tumors of mice receiving chronic morphine treatment as compared to those receiving PBS.33 These data provide convincing evidence of increased SP in the tumors and in the blood in res ponse to pain as well as after treatment with morphine. Importantly, treatments influencing the pathobiology of the disease leading to decreased pain also led to a decrease in circulating SP. Together, these data in two conditions with chronic pain show that SP is modulated in response to disease pathobiology, pain and pain treatment. SP may therefore serve as a potential marker of pain and its response to therapy. In addition, since SP appears to mediate neurogenic inflammation and cancer progression in pr e-clinical studies, its receptor NK1 provides an additional target to block the adverse effect of SP. Some NK1 receptor antagonists are FDA approved and can be utilized to reduce pain and/or reduce disease progression. Therefore, levels of SP will be critical to analyze and are likely to generate a novel hypothesis to be examined in future studies."
53,page_53,"Alliance A221504 54 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 Timing of SP and beta-endorphin measurement: We realize that due to the complex and heterogeneous tumor microenvironment which is further influenced by stress and different treatments for cancer and/or pain, the circulating levels of ligands can vary considerably. In transgenic sickle mice with severe systemic inflammation and pain, and in transgenic cancer -bearing (C3TAg) mice which have an inflammatory milieu and pain, we found that inflammatory cytokines and SP were both significantly modulated as early as 5 days and as late as 7 weeks of treatment, the last period of observation. 33,80,85,86 Therefore, we chose three time points for the current clinical study (i.e., at the start of the study to provide a baseline to compare subsequent effect of progression/treatments, and two relatively early time points [at 3 and 6 weeks]) with the expectation that we will detect a significant effect. Relatively early analysis of these biomarkers is important because it will provide a window of opportunity to offer additional treatment choices based on these biomarkers, such as NK1 antagonists if SP is increased or PAMORAs if beta -endorphin is increased. As described above, this would be supportive of our novel hypothesis of the role of pain associated mechanisms involving MOR/SP leading to the identification of actionable targets. We are cautiously optimistic of observing significant changes in the plasma levels of these marker s within 6 -8 weeks as compared to baseline and/or in response to therapy. Correlation of tumor progression, inflammatory response and pain: It is well known that inflammation is associated with both advanced cancer and pain independently as well as with cancer associated pain. In our pre -clinical studies, we observed a parallel increase in inflammatory cytokines and SP in the tumors of C3TAg mice treated with morphine. 33 Similarly, in transgenic sickle mice we found a significant increase in inflammatory cytokines and SP in the plasma and their release from skin biopsies as compared to that of control mice.85 While SP levels were uniformly increased, individual cytokines released from the skin were variable and were further modulated in a heterogeneous man ner with modulation of pain by different targeted therapies. Therefore, SP provides a more uniform measure of neuro- inflammation, which is relatively more specific to pain associated conditions. However, it could be an indicator of systemic inflammation as well. Therefore, its correlation with MOR may be critical for its association with pain leading to impairment of HRQoL. Correlation between SP and MOR expression: In pre -clinical studies, we found that treatment with morphine increased the expression of several inflammatory cytokines and SP in the tumors, correlating with increased tumor burden in transgenic C3TAg mice. 33 Importantly, while MOR expression was undetectable in early/small tumors, there was high expression of MOR in large tumors. Consistent with this observation, morphine administration stimulated the growth of relatively large, but not small tumors (at the time of tumor initiation). Thus, increased MOR expression complements increased SP expression. This could occur in response to morphine treatment as observed by us in sickle mice, but also in response to increased beta- endorphin, a ligand for MOR. In our clinical study on patients with prostate cancer, we found that MOR expression in the tumor biopsies was independently associated with sho rter time to progression, progression- free survival and overall survival, irrespective of opioid requirement for pain.5 Therefore, in the absence of exogenously administered opioids, activation of MOR (whose expression is increased in advanced tumors) is l ikely due to endogenous ligands such as endorphins, which may be increased due to stress and/or in response to pain. Our rationale to analyze beta- endorphin is further complemented by a recent study on cancer patients showing significantly increased plasma beta-endorphin levels in patients treated with the COX inhibitor drug flurbiprofen axetil in combination"
54,page_54,"Alliance A221504 55 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 with morphine as compared to morphine treatment alone, for 7 days.87 Satisfactory analgesia in this study was associated with increased plasma beta- endorphin levels as demonstrated by negative correlation between beta- endorphin in the plasma and pain scores (R2, 0.929 and P<0.01). Therefore, beta -endorphin can be a prognostic marker for analgesia, in addition to its activation of mitogenic signaling via MOR in the tumors, plausibly contributing to cancer progression. Seminal observations from our group showed that like morphine, beta- endorphin activated MAPK/ERK signaling in endothelial cells.1 Since both beta-endorphin and SP are released in conditions associated with pain and in response to morphine/pain treatment, their circulating levels may have a diagnostic as well as prognostic potential, with a bearing on improving HRQoL and clinical outcomes. Tumor specimens will be evaluated for expression of t he following markers by analysis of images acquired using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM): Mu opioid receptor 2-5 Kappa opioid receptor88 COX -2 (partly mediates the pro- angiogenic activity of MOR)31 Total and phosphorylated VEGFR2 and EGFR (cross- activated by MOR)2 Total and phosphorylated Stat3, Akt and MAPK (phosphorylated by MOR activation)1,2,38,42 Substance P (SP: marker of neurogenic inflammation and pain)85 CD31 (marker of blood vessels, for assessment of microvessel density)2 LYVE1 (mar ker of lymphatic vessels)33 Circulating levels of beta -endorphin and SP will be determined in plasma samples obtained at registration and at 3 weeks (+/ - 7 days) and 6 weeks (+/ - 7 days) after initiation of the study medication. All analysis will be perfor med in a double blind manner. The assays and analyses proposed herein are routinely performed in Dr. Kalpna Gupta’s laboratory using antibodies for each marker that have been validated and published. Paraffin embedded tumor sections will be stained with th ree different primary antibodies and species- specific secondary antibodies tagged with different fluorophors. A montage of Z -stack images acquired using a LSCM will be analyzed to quantitate immunoreactive (ir) pixels for each marker using Adobe Photoshop and Image Processing tool -kit Plug -in functions (Reindeer Games, Ashville, NC) as described by us. 5 The tumor microenvironment is composed of several different cellular entities critical to cancer progression which express opioid receptors, including tumor- , endothelial and lymphatic cells, of direct relevance to this proposal. Therefore, opioid- receptor associated activity will be analyzed in a cell -specific manner. Since associations with MOR will be defined, co- staining will be performed for each marker with MOR using three color immunostaining of tumor sections. Expected results: High MOR expression will be associated with endothelial, lymphatic and tumor cells. VEGFR2 phosphorylation associated with MOR will only be observed in the vasculature, wherea s EGFR, Stat3 and MAPK/ERK will be observed in endothelial as well as non- endothelial cells. It is likely that higher MOR -ir will be accompanied by decreased kappa opioid receptor -ir, suggestive of increased MOR activity as compared to kappa opioid recepto r in the tumors when opioids are used to treat pain. Correlative analysis with survival will reveal the significance of the mechanisms involved and additional targets to develop"
55,page_55,"Alliance A221504 56 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 strategies to ameliorate MOR -associated disease progression. Due to increased stress and pain, circulating levels of beta -endorphin and SP will be higher in subjects with higher disease burden, progression and pain. These will be even higher in subjects on higher doses of opioids, but may be attenuated in those receiving naloxegol t hat blocks peripheral opioid receptors. In this pilot study, statistical analysis of these correlative studies will be exploratory and hypothesis- generating. Potential for future clinical translation: Importantly, these correlative studies performed in a clinical setting will identify the receptors and signaling pathways activated in association with MOR. This would lead to future investigations to determine mechanisms underlying MOR -induced co- activation of these specific signaling pathways in human endothelial and/or cancer cells. In turn, these observations will provide targets to block MOR -induced tumor progression without compromising analgesia. Additionally, if we observe an inhibitory effect of naloxegol on mitogenic signaling pathways in the tumor, it could be further examined for its effect in combination with standard systemic anti -cancer therapies to improve clinical outcomes including HRQoL. 15.0 G ENERAL REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS AND CREDENTIALING None"

You are being asked to take part in this study because you have been diagnosed with a common type of advanced lung cancer ( non-small cell lung cancer: NSCLC ). You have also used pain medicines (such as morphine or similar drugs, called opioids) in the past 4 weeks to control pain caused by your cancer. People who are not in a study are usually treated with a variety of FDA - approved medications . Many patients with advanced lung cancer also require opioid pain medications to control pain at some time during the cours e of their disease. What are my other choices if I do not take part in this study? If you decide not to take part in this study, you have other choices. For example: • you may choose to have the usual approach described above • you may choose to take part in a different study, if one is available • or you may choose not to be treated for cancer but you may want to receive comfort care to relieve symptoms. Why is this study being done? You have advanced lung cancer and will be receiving opioids to relieve some of the cancer - related pain that you are experiencing. Opioids relieve pain through their action inside the brain. However, by their action outside of the brain, opioid medications can cause unwanted side effects such as constipation, nausea, vomiting, dry mouth, and problems passing urine. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effects of naloxegol . Naloxegol is a medicine that blocks the actions of opioids outside the brain, without interfering with the pain-relieving effect of opioids inside the brain. The researchers want to see if naloxegol will relieve some of the side effects of the opioid pain medications you are taking. They also want to see if naloxegol fights off future growth in the cancer that you have, whether or not you are taking pain medications. The effect of two different doses of naloxegol will be compared to placebo. A placebo is a pill that looks like the study drug but contains no medication."

One or both of the tablets could be a placebo. You should not have grapefruit or grapefruit juice while on this study. You should also check with your doctor or pharmacist before using any new medicines, including over-the-counter drugs because of possible drug interactions. You will be asked to record the day, number of pills taken, and time of each dose of naloxegol/placebo on a medication diary. You will be asked to bring the calendar and the pill bottles with you to your clinic visits. You will also be asked to record how much pain you are feeling and any pain medications you may have taken on another form. How long will I be in this study? You will receive naloxegol/placebo f or up to 2 years or until you experience any severe side effects. If you receive naloxegol/placebo for 2 years, you may choose to find out at that time whether you were receiving naloxegol or placebo. If you were receiving naloxegol, you and your doctor will decide whether you should continue taking naloxegol. The study wi ll not provide naloxegol after 2 years. Whether or not you remain on study treatment, the study doctor will continue to follow your progress. What extra tests and procedures will I have if I take part in this study? Most of the exams, tests (such as blood tests), and procedures (such as CT or other scans) you will have are part of the usual treatment and monitoring of your cancer. However, there are some extra tests that you will need to have if you take part in this study. Before you begin the study medication : You will complete some questionnaires before you start taking your study drug. During the study: You will be asked to come to the clinic for follow -up about 3 and 6 weeks after starting the study medication to see how you are doing physically and check your blood tests. You will also be asked to complete questionnaires 3 weeks and 6 weeks after you start naloxegol/placebo, and then every 3 weeks for one year and then every 3 months. These surveys will be about your pain medications, your urinary functions, your bowel movements and your quality of life. This should take about 15 minutes to complete."
65,page_65,"Alliance A221504 66 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 A patient study calendar that shows how often these tests, and questionnaires will be done is attached at the end of this document. If you do not come to the clinic at these times, you may either mail the questionnaires to your study doctor, or the clinic staff may obtain the information needed from you over the phone. What possible risks can I expect from taking part in this study? If you choose to take part in this study, there is a risk that: • You may lose time at work or home and spend more time in the hospital or doctor’s office than usual • You may be asked sensitive or private questions which you normally do not discuss • The addition of naloxegol to usual anti- cancer therapy may not be better, and could possibly be worse, than the usual anti- cancer therapy given by itself for your cancer. The Naloxegol used in this study may affect how different parts of your body work such as your liver, kidneys, heart, and blood. The study doctor will be testing your blood and will let you know if changes occur that may affect your health. There is also a risk that you could have side effects from naloxegol. Here are important points about side effects: • The study doctors do not know who will or will not have side effects. • Some side effects may go away soon, some may last a long time, or some may never go away. • Some side effects may interfere with your ability to have children. • Some side effects may be serious and may even result in death. Here are important points about how you and the study doctor can make side effects less of a problem: • Tell the study doctor if you notice or feel anything different so they can see if you are having a side effect. • The study doctor may be able to treat some side effects. • The study doctor may adjust naloxegol/placebo to try to reduce side effects."
66,page_66,"Alliance A221504 67 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 The tables below show the most common and the most serious side effects that researchers know about. There might be other side effects that researchers do not yet know about. If important new side effects are found, the study doctor will discuss these with you. Possible Side Effects of Naloxegol COMMON, SOME MAY BE SERIOUS In 100 people receiving Naloxegol, more than 20 and up to 100 may have: • Pain in the abdomen (stomach) OCCASIONAL, SOME MAY BE SERIOUS In 100 people receiving Naloxegol, from 4 to 20 may have: • Diarrhea • Nausea • Flatulence (bloating, gas) • Vomiting • Headache RARE, SOME MAY BE SERIOUS In 100 people receiving Naloxegol, 3 or fewer may have: • Perforation (tear) in the wall of the stomach, intestines or bowel • Symptoms due to blocking the effect of opioids (“opioid withdrawal”), such as excessive sweating, chills, diarrhea, pain in the abdomen (stomach), anxiety, irritability, and yawning. Let your study doctor know of any questions you have about possible side effects. You can ask the study doctor questions about side effects at any time. The topics discussed in questionnaires may cause you to feel embarrassed or uncomfortable. If this happens to you, please let your study doctor, nurse or other study staff know about your discomfort. Reproductive risks: You should not get pregnant, breastfeed, or father a baby while in this study. The study medication naloxegol/placebo used in this study could be very damaging to an unborn baby. Check with the study doctor about what types of birth control, or pregnancy prevention, to use while in this study. What possible benefits can I expe ct from taking part in this study? It is not possible to know at this time if addition of naloxegol/placebo to standard anti -cancer therapy is better than the usual approach ( anti-cancer therapy) so this study may or may not help you. This study will help researchers learn things that will help people in the future."
67,page_67,"Alliance A221504 68 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 Can I stop taking part in this study? Yes. You can decide to stop at any time. If you decide to stop for any reason, it is important to let the study doctor know as soon as possible so you can stop safely. If you stop, you can decide whether or not to let the study doctor continue to provide your medical information to the organization running the study. The study doctor will tell you about new information or changes in the study that may affec t your health or your willingness to continue in the study.

If you are injured or hurt as a result of taking part in this s tudy and need medical treatment, please tell your study doctor. The study sponsors will not offer to pay for medical treatment for injury. Your insurance company may not be willing to pay for study-related injury. If you have no insurance, you would be responsible for any costs. If you feel this injury was a result of medical error, you keep all your legal rights to receive payment for this even though you are in a study. Who will see my medical information? Your privacy is very important to us and the r esearchers will make every effort to protect it. Your information may be given out if required by law. For example, certain states require doctors to report to health boards if they find a disease like tuberculosis. However, the researchers will do their best to make sure that any information that is released will not identify you. Some of your health information, and/or information about your specimen, from this study will be kept in a central database for research. Your name or contact information will not be put in the database. There are organizations that may inspect your records. These organizations are required to make sure your information is kept private, unless required by law to provide information. Some of these organizations are: • The study sponsor and any drug company supporting the study. • The Institutional Review Board, IRB, is a group of people who review the research with the goal of protecting the people who take part in the study. • The Food and Drug Administration and the National Cancer Institute in the U.S., and similar ones if other countries are involved in the study. The Alliance has received a Certificate of Confidentiality from the federal government, which will help us to protect your privacy. The Certificate protects against the involuntary release of information about you collected during the course of the study. The researchers involved in this project may not be forced to identify you in any legal proceedings (criminal, civil, administrative, or legislative) at the federal, sta te or local level. However, some information may be required by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or for purposes of program review or audit. Also, you may choose to voluntarily disclose the protected information under certain circumstances. For example, if you or your guardian requests the release of information about you in writing (through, for example, a written request to release medical records to an insurance company), the Certificate does not protect against that voluntary disclosure."

ADDITIONAL STUDIES SECTION: This section is about optional studies you can choose to take part in This part of the consent form is about optional studies that you can choose to take part in. You will not get health benefits from any of these studies. The researchers leading this optional study hope the results will help other people with cancer in the future. The results will not be added to your medical records and you or your study doctor will not know the results. You will not be billed for these optional studies. You can still take part in the main study even if you say “no” to any or all of these studies. If you sign up for but cannot complete any of the studies for any reason, you can still take part in the main study. Circle your choice of “yes” or “no” for each of the following studies."
70,page_70,"Alliance A221504 71 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 Optional Sample Collections for Laboratory Studies and/or Biobanking for Possible Future Studies Researchers are trying to learn more about pain, cancer, and other health problems. Much of this research is done using samples from your blood or tissue. Through these studies, researchers hope to find new ways to prevent, detect, treat, or cure health problems. Some of these studies may be about genes. Genes carry information about features that are found in you and in people who are related to you. Researchers are interested in the way that genes affect how your body responds to treatment. If you choose to take part in this study, the study doctor for the main study would like to collect blood for research on substances in the body that cause pain and others that relieve pain. Researchers would also like to study samples from your lung cancer tissue that were obtained from you for diagnosis. The tissue will be analyzed for factors that are involved in causing pain and others that are involved in promoting tumor growth. We are asking for you r permission to store and use your samples and related health information (for example, your response to cancer treatment, results of study tests and medicines you are given) for medical research. The research that may be done is unknown at this time. Storing samples for future studies is called “biobanking”. The Biobank is being run by the Alliance Biorepository at Mayo Clinic and supported by the National Cancer Institute. WHAT IS INVOLVED? If you agree to take part, here is what will happen next: 1) About two extra teaspoons of blood will be collected from a vein in your arm once before starting the study medication and twice more (at about 3 and 6 weeks) after you start the study medication). All these blood samples will be collected at the time you are gi ving blood samples for routine (usual) tests related to your anti -cancer therapy. You will NOT have to undergo extra needle sticks to provide blood samples for these laboratory studies. 2) In addition, a sample from the tissue that was collected previously at the time of your biopsy or surgery will be sent to the Biobank. You will NOT be asked to undergo another biopsy to provide tissue for these laboratory studies. 3) Your sample and some related health information will be sent to a researcher for use in the stu dy described above. Remaining samples may be stored in the Biobank, along with samples from other people who take part. The samples will be kept until they are used up. 4) Qualified researchers can submit a request to use the materials stored in the Biobanks. A science committee at the clinical trials organization, and/or the National Cancer Institute, will review each request. There will also be an ethics review to ensure that the request is necessary and proper. Researchers will not be given your name or any other information that could directly identify you. 5) Neither you nor your study doctor will be notified when research will be conducted or given reports or other information about any research that is done using your samples. 6) Some of your genetic and hea lth information may be placed in central databases that may be public, along with information from many other people. Information that could directly identify you will not be included."
71,page_71,"Alliance A221504 72 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE RISKS? 1) The most common risks related to drawing blood from your arm are brief pain and possibly a bruise. 2) There is a risk that someone could get access to the personal information in your medical records or other information researchers have stored about you. 3) There is a risk that someone could trace the information in a central database back to you. Even without your name or other identifiers, your genetic information is unique to you. The researchers believe the chance that someone will identify you is very small, but the risk may change in the future as people come up with new ways of tracing information. HOW WILL INFORMATION ABOUT ME BE KEPT PRIVATE? Your privacy is very important to the researchers and they will make every effort to protect it. Here are just a few of the steps they will take: 1) When your samples are sent to the researchers, no information identifying you (such as your name) will be sent. Samples will be identified by a unique code only. 2) The list that links the unique code to your name will be kept separate from your sample and h ealth information. Any Biobank and Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology staff with access to the list must sign an agreement to keep your identity confidential. 3) Researchers to whom Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology send your sample and information will not know who you are. They must also sign an agreement that they will not try to find out who you are. 4) Information that identifies you will not be given to anyone, unless required by law. 5) If research results are published, your name and other perso nal information will not be used. WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS? You will not benefit from taking part in these laboratory studies. The results may help other patients in the future. ARE THERE ANY COSTS OR PAYMENTS? There are no costs to you or your insurance. You will not be paid for taking part. If any of the research leads to new tests, drugs, or other commercial products, you will not share in any profits. WHAT IF I CHANGE MY MIND? If you decide you no longer want your samples to be used, you can call the study doctor, _________________, (insert name of study doctor for main trial) at ________________________ (insert telephone number of study doctor for main trial) who will let the researchers know. Then, any sample that remains in the bank will no longer be used and related health information will no longer be collected. Samples or related information that have already been given to or used by researchers will not be returned."

The doses of long-acting opioids or liquid preparations are calculated exactly as for short -acting or immediate release opioids. 2) Multiply that total amount by the number for that opioid from the table below (e.g. 1.5 for oral oxycodone), to get the OME. 3) Add up all the OMEs to get the total OME, as illustrated in the examples below. Opioid Parenteral (IV/IM/SC, in mg) Oral (mg ) Multiplication factor Multiplication factor Buprenorphine 75 - Butorphanol 15 - Codeine 0.25 0.15 Fentanyl 300 2* (transdermal: see below) Hydrocodone - 1 Hydromorphone 20 4 Levorphanol 15 7.5 Meperidine 0.4 0.1 Methadone** 13.5 4.7 Morphine 3 1 Nalbuphine 3 - Oxycodone - 1.5 Oxymorphone 30 3 Tapentadol - 0.4 *Multiply the fentanyl patch strength by 2 to get the OME directly. Thus, a 25 microgram/hour fentanyl patch = 50 OME.89 Example 1: The patient is using MS Contin 30 mg PO BID + oxycodone/acetaminophen (Percocet; 5 mg/325 mg strength) 2 tabs every 6 hours (for breakthrough pain): MS Contin 30 mg x 2 times/day = 60 mg/day Multiply 60 by 1 (the number for oral morphine) = 60 x 1 = 60 OME + Oxycodone 5 mg x 2 tabs x 4 times/day = 40 mg/day Multiply 40 by 1.5 (the number for oral oxycodone) = 40 x 1.5 = 60 OME Total OME = 60 + 60 = 120 OME"
81,page_81,"Alliance A221504 82 Update 2 Version Date 6/25/2019 Example 2: The patient is using a fentanyl patch 50 micrograms/hour strength + morphine elixir (10 mg/5 ml strength) 5 ml every 4 hours (for breakthrough pain): Fentanyl 50 micrograms/hour Multiply 50 by 2 (*see above) = 50 x 2 = 100 OME + Morphine elixir 10 mg x 6 times/day = 60 mg/day Multiply 60 by 1 (the number for oral morphine) = 60 x 1 = 60 OME Total OME = 100 + 60 = 160 OME **For conversion of methadone to OMEs, we will use the conversion factors recommended by Walker et al. 90 This is a carefully conducted analysis of patients who switched from IV or oral methadone to morphine or other opioids. The authors recommend using a ratio of 1:4.7 for conversion of oral methadone to oral morphine, and a ratio of 1:13.5 for conversion of IV methadone to oral morphine. Of note, the conversion ratio remained constant (did not change) with increasing dose of methadone, unlike the change in ratio recommended when the conversion is in the opposite direction, i.e. when morphine is converted to methadone.91"
