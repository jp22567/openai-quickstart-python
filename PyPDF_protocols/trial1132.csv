SYNOPSIS Protocol Title: A Phase 3, Multi -Center, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo - Controlled, 104 -Week Study to Evalu ate the Efficacy and Safet y of Belimumab Administered in Combination with Rituximab to Adult Subjects with Sy stemic L upus Erythematosus (SL E) Short Title: A Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safet y of Belimumab Administered in Combination with Rit uximab to Adult Subjects with Sy stemic L upus Erythematosus (SL E)-BLISS -BELIEVE Rationale: SLE is characterized by autoantibodies, including antibodies to double -stranded DNA (dsDNA), and b y abnormal B cell activation and differentiation , indicating that therapies which deplete or modulate B cells could be beneficial in treating SL E. Belimumab and rituximab are monoclonal antibodies that achieve their expected pharmacology through different but complementary mechanisms; therefore, based on their mechanisms of action, sy nergistic effects when used in combination in the treatment of SLE are possible compared to either treatment alone. Belimumab treatment increases peripheral memory B cells potentially by mobilization from tissues this may include the autoreac tive B cell compartment. This mobilization would expose these cells to more efficient depletion by rituximab. Continuing belimumab after a single course of rituximab would then suppress the B-lymphocy te stimulator ( BLyS)elevation observed after rituximab monotherap y, thus suppressing the signal which leads to rapid repopulation of B cells, including autoreactive B cells. This study will assess whether co -administration of belimumab and a single cy cleof rituximab may optimize treatment with belimumab, resu lting in improvements in clinical status with a favorable safety profile. Objectives and Endpoints: The key evaluations are based on comparing belimumab with or without a single cy cle of rituximab (the combination arm vs. the control arm). There are limi ted analy ses planned to compare the combination of belimumab with a single cy cle of rituximab (combination arm) to belimumab with standard therap y (reference arm) .Details of the analy ses to be conducted will be described in the Reporting and Analy sis Plan (RAP), including analysis of the combination arm vs. the control arm and the combination arm vs. the reference arm.

Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms; belimumab plus rituximab -placebo (Arm A , control ), belimumab plus rituximab (Arm B , combination ), or open -label belimumab plus standard therapy (Arm C , reference ). Blinded independent assessors will conduct the SL EDAI -2K at key time points . An I ndependent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will review the safety data on a regular basis. Number of Participant s: A total of approximately 560participants are expected to be screened, with a goal of randomizing at least 280participants ( 50% scree n failure rate). The sample size may be increased up to a maximum of 320 participants if the dropout rate, missing data or number of major protocol deviations suggests further participants are necessary to ensure robust conclusions can be drawn. The decisi on to increase the sample size will be made without unblinding the trial. Treatment Groups and Duration: Overview At least 280participants will be randomized in a 1:2:1 ratio to 1 of 3 arms: belimumab plus rituximab -placebo (Arm A, control, target N= 70),belimumab plus rituximab (Arm B, combination, target N= 140), or belimumab plus standard therapy (Arm C, reference, target N= 70). Arms A and B are double -blind; participants will receive belimumab 200 mg/week for 51 weeks. Arm C (reference) is an open -label arm with belimumab subcutaneous (SC) 200 mg/week and standard therapy for 104 weeks. Arm C (reference) will provide a qualitative reference to assess the relative performance of Arm A (control) and Arm B (combination) vs. currently available standard SLE therapy (Arm C). The concomitant medication rules and definitions of treatment failure are the same for the"
15,page_15,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 16double -blind control and combination arms, Arms A and B, but differ from those for the open -label reference arm, Arm C. Randomization and the first dose of belimumab should be completed within 35 days of initiation of screening procedures. Participants will be receiving stable standard therapy at entry . At randomization, participants will be stratified by their screening SL EDAI -2K score ( 9 vs. 10),by immunosuppressant use at screening (immunosuppressant use vs. no use) and b y screening corticosteroid dose (prednisone equivalent 10 mg/day vs. >10mg/day ). Belimumab will be administered SC on Day 1 and then weekly (i.e., every 7 day s 1 day ) through Week 51 for Arms A and B, and through Week 103 for Arm C . SC injections will be administered at alternating injection sites between the left or right thighs and the abdomen. Rituximab -placebo or rituximab will be administered b y intravenous (IV) infusions at Weeks 4 and 6 for Arms A and B. Participants in Arms A and B will be administered a pre -medication regimen 30 minutes before each rituximab - placebo or rituximab infusion on Weeks 4 and 6, including meth ylprednisolone 100 mg IVor equivalent , an antihis tamine, and acetaminophen or equivalent . Participants in any arm who are deemed treatment failures for efficacy endpoints at any time during the stud y will be encouraged to remain in the study and continue to have all efficacy and safet y assessments. Participants randomized to Arms A or B who enter the study on immunosuppressants will discontinue immunosuppressants prior to or on the day of the Week 4 visit. Continuing the stable immunosuppressant dose until Week 4 allows participants to receive 3 weeks ofbelimumab SC prior to discontinuing their immunosuppressants. Corticosteroids may be adjusted as necessary during this transition period. If participants in Arms A and B receive immunosuppressants after the Week 4 visit they will be deemed treatment failures. Participants in Arm C will continue their stable immunosuppressants throughout the study at the discretion of the investigator. If participants in Arm C require an increased dose of their stable immunosuppressant after Week 1 2or addition of a new immunosuppressant they will be considered a treatment failure . After the initial 12 weeks of study treatment, a protocol -specified corticosteroid taper will be initiated and conducted under the direction of the investigator for participants in all 3arms. Th e taper will proceed with a target of reaching a prednisone equivalent dose of 5mg/day by Week 26. If the investigator believes the participant would benefit from continued steroid taper and, if tolerated, a prolonged corticosteroid taper should continue after Week 26 with the goal of corticosteroid discontinuation. Participants who are able to tolerate the final taper will be withdrawn from corticosteroids. If a participant is unable to tolerate the final stage of the corticosteroid taper, the investigato r may reinitiate corticosteroids at a prednisone equivalent dose of up to and including 5 mg/day . If a 7- day average prednisone equivalent dose of >5 mg/day is required at any time after Week 26visit (i.e., beginning first day of Week 27) , the participant will be considered a treatment failure for the efficacy endpoints. Anti-malarial therapies for SL E may not be initiated during the study , but may be continued or dose -adjusted during the study , and will be allowed within the definitions of"

Switching of anti -malarial due to toxicity or lack of availabili tyis permitted Non-Steroidal Anti -Inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs )(for 7 day s) may not be initiated during the stud y, but may be continued and dose adjusted as clinicall y indicated un til the Week 44 visit. After the Week 44 visit any increase in the NSAID dose above the baseline (Day 1) or Week 44 dose, whichever is higher, will declare the participant as a treatment failure unless the NSAID is given for <7 day s. During the 52 -week dou ble-blind portion of the study , participants in Arms A and B who cannot tolerate discontinuation of immunosuppressants or taper of corticosteroids or, in the opinion of the investigator, require added therapy , will be considered treatment failures for the efficacy endpoints. Blinding to the treatment assignments in Arms A and B will be maintained. At the investigator's discretion, these participants may continue treatment with belimumab, and/or be treated with additional SL E therapies as necessary , includin g corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants. Participants in Arm C who are unable to tolerate the corticosteroid taper or, in the opinion of the investigator, require increased doses of their baseline immunosuppressants or addition of a new immunosuppressa nt will be considered treatment failures for the efficacy endpoints. Participants in Arms A and B will enter into the 52 -week treatment -free, observational phase of the stud y after completing Week 52 (Weeks 53 through 104). “Treatment -free” refers to no a ctive treatment with study treatment (i.e., belimumab and/or rituximab). Participants in Arm C will continue to receive belimumab SC and their stable immunosuppressants during Weeks 53 through 104. For participants in all three treatment arms, treatment wi th anti -malarials, NSAIDs, and/or corticosteroids with a prednisone equivalent dose of 5 mg/day will be allowed in Weeks 53 to 104. During Weeks 53 to 104, additional treatment may be given if the investigator believes the participant would benefit becau se he/she: a) responded to study treatment but did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint, or b) responded to study treatment but subsequently experienced increasing disease activity which requires additional therap y. Additional treatment may include open -label belimumab, corticosteroids (>5 mg/day ), and/or immunosuppressants, and will be administered at the discretion of the investigator. Treatment with open -label rituximab is allowed within the protocol, but is not encouraged. Belimumab will be provided b y the sponsor for those participants who reinitiate treatment with belimumab, but additional treatment with rituximab and/or other medications will not be provided b y the sponsor . NOTE: These participants will be considered treatment failures for the Week 64 efficacy anal yses if the additional treatment (see above) occurs before theWeek 64visit, and for the Week 104 efficacy analyses if the additional treatment occurs before theWeek 104 visit.Participants who are deemed treatment failures will continue to be followed in the study and have all efficacy and safet y assessments performed. In the event that a participant discontinues the study or withdraws consent early, an Early Withdrawal visit 1 -4 weeks after last dose of study treatment and a Follow Up v isit 8 weeks after the last dose of study treatment should be scheduled. Additionally , an attempt"

Stud y Rationale Systemic Lupus Ery thematosus ( SLE)is characterized by autoantibodies, including antibodies to double -stranded DNA (dsDNA), and by abnormal B cell activation and differentiation [ Davidson , 2001], indicating that therapies which deplete or modulate Bcells could be beneficial in treating SLE. Belimumab and rituximab ar e monoclonal antibodies that achieve their expected pharmacology through different but complementary mechanisms; therefore, based on their mechanisms of action, sy nergistic effects in the treatment of SL E are possible .Belimumab treatment increases periphe ral memory B cells potentially by mobilization from tissues this may include the autoreactive Bcell compartment. This study will assess whether co -administration of belimumab and a single cy cle of rituximab may optimize treatment with belimumab ,resulting in improvements in clinical status with a favorable safety profile, by comparing participants randomized to belimumab plus rituximab vs. belimumab plus rituximab -placebo. An open -label arm is included to provide a qualitative reference to standard therapy . 3.2. Background Belimumab is an important treatment option for patients with SL E, but significant numbers of patients do not achieve a state of low disease activity , and are still left with moderate level of residual disease activit y. There is a large unmet m edical need for additional effective treatment which could meaningfull y reduce disease -related morbidity and mortality and limit the toxicity associated with traditional treatment regimens such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. Rituximab treatment results in nearly complete depletion of CD20+ B cells in the peripheral blood within hours of treatment. In contrast, relativel y high numbers of CD20+ B cells persist in the bone marrow following initial treatment with rituximab [ Boumans , 2011]. Belimumab treatment increases peripheral memory B cells potentially by mobilization from tissues this may include the autoreactive B cell compartment from tissues into the periphery. This mobilization would expose these cells to more efficient depletion by rituximab. Continuing belimumab after a single course of rituximab would suppress the B-lymphocyte stimulator ( BLyS)elevation observed after rituximab monotherap y, thus suppressing the signal which leads to potential repopu lation of autoreactive B cells. A treatment regimen which could reliabl y and effectively achieve and maintain low disease activity or remission, including patients with earlier and potentially more reversible disease prior to the development of permanent d isability or end -organ damage, would change the paradigm b y which SLE is treated today. This patient population has a large unmet medical need as 50% of SLE patients develop end -organ damage within the first 5 years of diagnosis [ Urowitz , 2012]. Recent scientific research suggests that a combination treatment with anti -BLyS and anti -CD20 may potentially address this need. Anti-BLyS and anti -CD20 therapeutics operate through different but complementary mechanisms and t he addition of a single cy cle of rituximab treatment may optimize the effect of belimumab treatment in SLE."
34,page_34,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDE NTIA L 205646 35Synergy may emerge through the following mechanisms: Belimumab may cause redistribution of memory and germinal center B cells from ly mphoid tissue i nto blood, where they are exposed to higher rituximab concentrations in the absence of local tissue factors that protect the B cells in their niches, which is likely to increase B cell depletion. Neutralization of serum BLy S level increases seen after ritu ximab monotherapy , preventing rapid B cell repopulation which is associated with SL E disease flares. Increased stringency of B cell reconstitution in the presence of anti -BLyS therap y with belimumab, resulting in fewer auto -reactive cells being formed after B cell depletion with rituximab. Preclinical data supporting the h ypothesis that a combination of belimumab and rituximab may provide additional efficacy over either agent alone were generated in a human -CD20 expressing mouse model. Experiments using thi s model demonstrated relative resistance of the marginal zone (MZ) B cell compartment to anti -CD20 antibody monotherap y. Approximately 50% of these cells remained following anti -CD20 mAb as compared to complete depletion of circulating mature B cells. MZ B cells were rendered sensitive to anti -CD20 mAb depletion when they were effectivel y mobilized from tissues into the vasculature with anti -L and anti -4 integrand mAbs. Thus, the tissue B cells were not inherentl y resistant to anti -CD20 mAb treatment: tre atment response was enhanced b y prior mobilization of the MZ B cells into the vasculature [ Gong , 2005]. Additionally , when mouse BLy S receptor (BR3) -Fc and anti -hCD20 were combined in this model, there was more effectiv e tissue B cell depletion of MZ B cells and follicular (FO)B cells than with either agent alone. Similar observations were made in murine SL E models [ Lin, 2015] in which dual targeting resulted in greater efficacy with increased tissue B cell depletion, greater reduction in a range of auto -antibody levels, and significant decreases in total IgG1, IgG2b, IgG3, IgM, and IgA when compared to BLy S inhibition and CD20 B cell depletion alone. There have been 4 recent case repo rts of patients with SL E and Sjogren’s Sy ndrome demonstrating the ability of the combination to induce remission or states of disease control for prolonged periods [ Kraaij , 2014; De Vita , 2014; Simonetta , 2016]. I n one case a 32-year-old woman with a 3 y ear history of lupus nephritis who previously failed 2induction regimens was treated with rituximab which led to a partial response. When there was still B cell depletion but as B cells began to repopulate, the patient was started on belimumab at which point the patient entered remission on no steroids or immunosuppressants. Remission persisted after 18 months. The second case involved a 42-year-old man with lupus nephritis who likewise had failed standard therapy and induction regimens. Initiation of rituximab led to only partial response and a full relapse occurred while the patient was still B cell depleted but B cells began to repopulate , at which point belimumab was started. The patient entered a prolonged (>12 months) state of disease control on no steroids or immunosuppressants but on belimumab. The third case involved a 23 -year-old woman with refractory lupus nephritis who failed stan dard therap y and the addition of belimumab only resulted in transient partial reduction of proteinuria. Belimumab was stopped and the patient received one cy cle of rituximab with no significant or sustained effects on disease activity , and a rebound increa se in serum B-"
35,page_35,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDE NTIA L 205646 36cell activating factor of the TNF ligand family (BAFF )levels was detected. Belimumab was reintroduced and the patient experienced “rapid and dramatic” improvements in clinical and biological parameters including proteinuria. After more than 18 months no disease flares or proteinuria relapses were observed. I n the fourth case, a patient with severe, refractory (including to prior courses of rituximab) Sjogren’s Sy ndrome with associated Mucosa associated ly mphoid tissue ( MAL T)lymphoma and cryg lobulinemic vasculitis was treated with belimumab. The patient did not respond and so, as a last resort, rituximab was tried again, while there was still ongoing exposure to belimumab. This was followed b y complete and persistent regression of the l ymphoma , skin ulcers and vasculitis. Cry oglobulins and rheumatoid factor became persistentl y negative and the patient is in remission after three and a half years. A detailed description of the chemistry , pharmacology , efficacy and safet y of belimumab is provided in the most recent version of the Belimumab I nvestigator’s Brochure . Refer to the local rituximab approved product label for description of the chemistry , pharmacology , efficacy , and safet y of rituximab. 3.3. Benefit/Risk A ssessment More det ailed information about the established benefits and risks of belimumab and rituximab, including expected adverse events (AEs), may be found in the Belimumab Investigator’s Brochure and local rituximab approved product label, respectivel y. There are no published clinical trial data for the co -administration of belimumab with rituximab ; however, the following data were reviewed and no new safety risks bey ond what would be expected for either agent alone is suggested from the limited data available from patients who may have had overlapping exposures to belimumab and rituximab: The GSK Safet y Database of AEs from clinical trials and post -marketing experience An insurance claims database (Safety Works) In-stream, blinded data from an ongoing GSK study of belimumab in subjects with vasculitis who were induced with high dose corticosteroids and either rituximab or cy clophosphamide In stream, blinded data from an ongoing GSK study of belimumab co - administered with rituximab in the treatment of pr imary Sjögren’ s syndrome Given that the experience of co -administration of anti -CD20 and anti -BLyS therapies to date is very limited, robust safety monitoring and stopping rules are being implemented to safeguard subject safety . The key risk assessment an d mitigation strategy for this protocol is outlined below and in Section 8.2."

Risk A ssessment Potential Risk of Clinical Significance Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy Investigational Pr oduct (IP): Belimumab (GSK1550188), Rituximab, and Belimumab and Rituximab Coadministration Infections: Prolonged B cell suppression and more complete B cell depletion expected; potential for more profound hypogammaglobulinemia with increased risk for se rious infections including opportunistic infections (OIs), Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML), and Hepatitis B virus ( HBV)reactivation. Rituximab: The rate of serious infections with rituximab in the rheumatoid arthritis ( RA) population is 4% per year. Reactivation of hepatitis B has also been very rarely reported in RA patients receiving rituximab. Late onset neutropenia occurs rarely in patients treated with rituximab. Belimumab: The rate of serious infections for SLE is 5% of subjects rec eiving either belimumab or placebo. Belimumab and Rituximab Coadministration: Infections are expected events for both belimumab and rituximab. Cases of PML have been very rarely reported, including fatal events, for both rituximab and belimumab in autoimmu ne diseases. There is preclinical evidence for prolonged B cell suppression and more complete B cell depletion as well as effect on IgG1+ plasma cells in the long-lived bone marrow niche thought to be less Exclusions based on significant infection history, serologic evidence of past or present HBV or Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection; IgG <250 mg/dL (note: <400mg/dL for Germany) , IgA deficiency (IgA level <10 mg/dL), neutrophils <1.5X 109/L. A PML management plan including neurologic questionnaire, patient alert card, and stopping criteria will be utilized. An independent PML Panel is also available for consultations. A diagnosis of PML should be considered in any subject presenting with new -onset or deteriorating neurological signs and symptoms. The subject should be referred to a neurologist or other appropriate specialist for evaluation. If PML is confirmed, study agent should be discontinued and consideration should be given to stopping immunosuppressant therapy. If PML is suspected, this should be reported to the Medical Monitor within 24 hrs. The"

Assessment of the translatability of the IgG reductions to humans is difficult to make due to species differences in B cell biology and different treatments; however, the mouse data raises the hypoth etical risk that immunoglobulin levels may reduce more with coadministration treatment. Neutropenia: SLE disease related neutropenia and Rituximab induced neutropenia may result in further reduction in circulating neutrophils and/or influence timing of thi s neutropenia onset as compared to when Rituximab is administered alone.appropriateness of continuing study agent, while the case is being assessed, should be discussed. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection, monitor laboratory values, request that patients report signs of infection. Treat infections immediately and appropriately. Neutropenia : Individual subject’s treatment with belimumab and rit uximab/rituximab -placebo will be discontinued for (a) life threatening infection; (b) IgG <400 mg/dL if associated with a serious infection. Subjects should be monitored for neutropenia throughout the study. Neutropenia should be managed appropriately acc ording to local practice and clinical judgement should be applied with regard to the appropriateness of continuing study treatment in these subjects. •Study treatment with rituximab/rituximab - placebo (infusions Week 4 and/or Week 6) must be temporarily with held and the GSK medical monitor consulted about"

Systemic Infusion / Injection -Related Reactions, Hypersensitivity Reactions and Immunogenicity: Serum Sickness: Serum sickness has been associated with rituximab in autoimmune indications [ Meijer , 2010]. There is a potential risk for increased immunogenicity due to cross reactivity which could lead to increased frequency of hypersensitivity reactions, particularly of the delayed type.Rituximab: The incidenc e of serum sickness associated with rituximab in pSS studies has ranged from 6 -38% [ Carubbi , 2014]. Administration of belimumab and rituximab may result in infusion and hypersensitivity reactions, which can be severe and can be fatal. Delay in the onset of serious hypersensitivity reactions can occur. Both rituximab and belimumab have been associated with delayed type non -acute Hypersensitivity reaction ( HSR )/serum sickness, although no relationship to Anti-drug Antib ody (ADA)has been established. Belimumab and Rituximab Coadministration : Incidences of hypersensitivity and infusion reactions have been noted to be higher with co - administration vs. mono -biologic therapy but no Immunogenicity will be evaluated with periodic assessment over the course of the study. A pre -medication regimen will be given before each rituximab/rituximab placebo infusion: methylprednisolone 100 mg IV, an antihistamine and acetaminophen or equivalent . Subjects should remain under clinical supervision for 3 hours after completion of the first belimumab injection and the rituximab/placebo infusions. Should symptoms of acute hypersensitivity oc cur, an extended period of monitoring may be appropriate, based on clinical judgement. If subjects are to receive belimumab after 4 consecutive weeks of not receiving belimumab, the first belimumab dose must be administered in the clinic and subject"

Patients will be given an alert card for HSR and delayed HSR/serum sickness. Malignancy: There is an increased risk of malignancy, including Non -Hodgkin’s lymphoma, in SLE. There is a theoretical increased risk of malignancy with combination immunosuppressive mechanisms.Belimumab and Rituximab: Immunomodulatory drugs like rituximab and belimumab may increase the risk of malignancy. To date, no causal relationship between be limumab or rituximab and malignancy, including B cell lymphoma, has been detected, both of which have been administered long term and in combination with other immunosuppressants of various mechanisms.Subjects with a history of malignancy in the 5 yrs prior to randomization, except for adequately treated basal or squamous cell cancers of the skin, or carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix, will be excluded. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of malignancy, monitor laboratory values, request that pati ents report signs and symptoms. Treat appropriately. Interaction with Vaccinations: There is a risk of reduced antibody titers with mono and dual B cell immunotherapy. The potential synergistic effect of rituximab and belimumab may result in a prolonged B cell depletion that could have a similar inhibitory impact on vaccine responses as administering repeated doses of rituximab.Rituximab: As described in the label [ Rituxan package insert, 2016], the response to pneumococcal vaccination (a T cell independent antigen) as measured by an increase in antibody titers to at least 6 of 12 serotypes was lower in patients treated with rituximab plus methotrexate (MTX) as compared to patients treated with MTX alone (19% vs. 61 %). Additionally, a lower proportion of patients in the rituximab plus MTX Immunization with live vaccines is prohibited from 30 days prior to Day 1 and during belimumab use. Subjects’ v accination status should be assessed and current immunization guidelines followed; all necessary vaccinations should be administered if possible no later than 30 days prior to Day 1."

In a comb ination study, median antibody titers (tetanus, diphtheria, pneumococcus) at Week 32 were reduced from baseline in atacicept (recombinant fusion protein which inhibits BLyS and APRIL) but not placebo -treated patients who had been previously treated with ri tuximab. However, these values recovered close to baseline by Week 16 of the follow -up, there were few shifts to below protective titers, and no between group differences with respect to the frequency of shifts. Belimumab: The efficacy of concurrent vaccin ation in patients receiving belimumab is not known; however, in the belimumab vaccination trial, evaluation of the impact of belimumab treatment on response to on - treatment vaccination with 23 -valent pneumococcal vaccine revealed that immune responses to t he different serotypes were similar in SLE patients receiving belimumab compared with those not receiving treatment at the time of vaccination."

43,page_43,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 443.3.2. Benef it Assessment The primary data supporting efficacy of intravenous ( IV)belimumab were the Phase 3 trials (C1056 and C1057) in which 1684 subjects were treated for up to 52 weeks (C1057) or 76 weeks (C1056) ( Belimumab Investigator’s Brochure , Section 5.3.1.2). Belimumab produced significant improvements in the SL E Responder Index as well as in the individual component Safety of Estrogen in Lupus National Assessment Trial (SEL ENA) -Systemic Lupus Ery thematosus Disease Activit y Index (SL EDAI) score in both studies. Pooled analyses demonstrated steroid sparing and decreased risk of severe flares over 52 weeks. Clinical trial data for belimumab since approval continue to show efficacy in the treatment of SL E through decreased SL Eflares and decreased disease activity across multiple organ s ystems ( Belimumab I nvestigator’s Brochure , Section 5.3.1.3). Similar results were observed in the pivotal Phase 3 trial of belimumab SC 200 mg/week (BEL112341) , with significant improvements in the SL E Responder Index and time to first severe flare endpoints. The inclusion of rituximab provides an opportunity for subjects with active SLE despite standard lupus therap y to benefit from potentially disease modify ing regimen that may include induction of disease control or clinical remission and a reduction in or complete discontinuation of corticosteroids and immunosuppressant therapy . 3.3.3. Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion Taking into account the measures that will be im plemented to minimize risk to subjects participating in this study, the potential risks associated with co -administration of belimumab and rituximab are justified b y the anticipated benefits that may be afforded to patients with SL E who choose to participa te in this trial. 4.

Overall Design This is a Phase 3, multi -center, 3 -arm, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 104week superiority study to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of belimumab administered in combination with a single cy cle of rituximab to adult participants with SLE. Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment arms; belimumab plus rituximab -placebo (Arm A, control), belimumab plus rituximab (Arm B, combination), or belimumab plus standard therap y (Arm C, reference). Arms A and B are double -blind; Arm C is open -label. In order to min imize bias given that Arm C is open -label, blinded independent assessors will conduct SL EDAI -2K evaluations at key time points, including the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (I DMC) will review the safe ty data periodically to ensure external medical and statistical review of safet y issues (Section 10.4.4 ). Randomization and the first dose of belimumab should be completed within 35 days of initiation of screeni ng procedures. Participants will be receiving stable standard therapy at entry . At randomization, participants will be stratified by their screening SL EDAI -2K score ( 9 vs. 10), b y immunosuppressant use at screening (immunosuppressant use vs. no use), an d by screening corticosteroid dose (prednisone equivalent 10 mg/day vs. >10mg/day ). Belimumab will be administered subcutaneousl y (SC)on Day 1 and then weekl y (i.e., every 7 days 1 day ) through Week 51 for Arms A and B, and through Week 103 for Arm C. SC injections will be administered at alternating injection sites between the left or right thighs and the abdomen. Rituximab -placebo or rituximab will be administered b y IV infusions at Weeks 4 and 6 for Arms A and B. Participants in Arms A and B will be administered a pre -medication regimen 30 minutes before each rituximab - placebo or rituximab infusion on Weeks 4 and 6, including meth ylprednisolone 100 mg IVor equivalent , an antihistamine , and acetaminophen or equivalent . The primary efficacy endpoint wi ll be measured at Week 52. Participants from an y arm who are deemed treatment failures at an y time during the stud y will be encouraged to remain in the study and continue to have all efficacy and safet y assessments. Participants randomized to Arms A and B who enter the study on immunosuppressants will discontinue immunosuppressants at or prior to the Week 4 visit. Continuing the stable immunosuppressant dose until Week 4 allows participants to receive 3 weeks of belimumab SC prior to discontinuing their imm unosuppressants. Corticosteroids may be adjusted as necessary during this transition period. If participants in Arms A and B receive immunosuppressants after the Week 4 visit they will be deemed treatment failures for the efficacy endpoints. Participants i n Arm C who enter the stud y on stable immunosuppressants may continue their stable immunosuppressants throughout the study at the discretion of the investigator. If participants in Arm C require an addition of a new immunosuppressant after Week 1 2they will be considered a treatment failure. See Section 7.7.1.4 for additional details on management of immunosuppressants."
50,page_50,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 51After the initial 12 weeks of study treatment, a protocol -specified corticosteroid taper will be initiated and conducted under the direction of the investigator for participants in all 3arms. The taper will proceed with a target of reaching a prednisone equivalent dose of 5mg/day by Week 26. If the investigator believes the participant would ben efit from continued steroid taper and, if tolerated, a prolonged corticosteroid taper should continue after Week 26 with the goal of corticosteroid discontinuation. Participants who are able to tolerate the final taper will be withdrawn from corticosteroid s. If a participant is unable to tolerate the final stage of the corticosteroid taper, the investigator may reinitiate corticosteroids at a prednisone equivalent dose of up to and including 5 mg/day . If a 7- day average prednisone equivalent dose of >5 mg/d ay is required at any time after Week 26, the participant will be considered a treatment failure for the efficacy endpoints. The recommended corticosteroid taper scheme is described in Appendix 2. Anti-malarial therap ies for SLEmay not be initiated during the study , but may be continued or dose -adjusted during the study , and will be allowed within the definitions of the efficacy endpoints. During the 52 -week double -blind phase, participants in Arms A and B who cannot tolerate discontinuation of immunosuppressants or taper of corticosteroids or, in the opinion of the investigator, require added therap y, will be considered treatment failures for the efficacy endpoints. Blinding to the treatment assignments in Arms A and B will be maintained. At the investigator's discretion, these participants may continue treatment with belimumab, and/or be treated with additional SL E therapies as necessary , including corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants. Participants in Arm C who are unable to tolerate the corticosteroid taper or, in the opinion of the investigator, require increased doses of their baseline immunosuppressants or addition of a new immunosuppressant will be considered treatment failures for the efficacy endpoints. Participants in Arms A and B will enter into the 52 -week treatment -free, observational phase of the stud y after completing Week 52 (Weeks 53 through 104). “Treatment -free” refers to no active treatment with study treatment (i.e., belimumab and/or rituximab). Participants in Arm C will continue to receive belimumab SC and their stable immunosuppressants during Weeks 53 through 104. Treatment with anti -malarials, NSAIDs, and/or corticosteroids with a prednisone equivalent dose of 5mg/day will be allowed in We eks 53 through 104 in all three arms. During Weeks 53 to 104, additional treatment may be given if the investigator believes the participant would benefit because he/she: a) responded to study treatment but did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint; or b ) responded to study treatment but subsequently experienced increasing disease activity which requires additional therap y. Additional treatment may include open -label belimumab, corticosteroids (>5 mg/day ), and/or immunosuppressants, and will be administer ed at the discretion of the investigator. Additional treatment with rituximab is allowed, but not encouraged. Belimumab will be provided b y the sponsor to those participants who reinitiate treatment with belimumab, but additional treatment with rituximab a nd/or other SL E medications will not be provided b y the study. These participants will be considered treatment failures for the Week 104 efficacy anal yses. Participants who are deemed treatment failures will be encouraged to continue in the study and to ha ve all efficacy and safet y assessments."

Number of Participants A total of approxi mately 560participants are expected to be screened, with a goal of randomizing at least 280participants ( 50% screen failure rate). The sample size may be increased up to a maximum of 320 participants if the dropout rate, missing data or number of major p rotocol deviations suggests further participants are necessary to ensure robust conclusions can be drawn. The decision to increase the sample size will be made without unblinding the trial. See Section 10.2, Sam ple size determination. 5.3.

Participants who discontinue study therapy but remain in the study will follow the study visit schedule . Participants who discontinue study treatment and withdraw from the study up to Week 52 are required to complete an Early Withdrawal Visit and a Follow -up Visit; the Early Withdrawal Visit is scheduled 1 to 4 weeks after the last dose of belimumab and the Follow -up Visit is scheduled 8 weeks after the last dose of belimumab.

Participants who are deemed to meet treatment failure criteria at an y time in the study will be encouraged to remain in the study and continue to have all efficacy and safet y assessments. The end of the stud yis defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study . 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design 5.4.1. Selection of Controls The belimumab p lus rituximab -placebo arm (Arm A) will be used as the study control arm because belimumab has demonstrated efficacy in 4 large, controlled, Phase 3 controlled clinical trials, HGS1006 -C1056 (referred to hereafter as C1056), HGS1006 -"
54,page_54,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 55C1057 (C1057), BEL113750 , and BEL112341, and remains the onl y biologic approved for the treatment of SLE. An open -label reference arm of belimumab plus standard therap y, including immunosuppressants (Arm C) is included to provide a qualitative reference to assess the relative per formance of Arm A (control) and Arm B (combination) vs. belimumab plus standard SLE therapy in current practice (Arm C, reference). Belimumab SC 200 mg weekl y will be dosed for 51 weeks for Arms A and B since this was the dose and duration of therap y for t he primary endpoint in the positive Phase 3 study of SC belimumab (BEL112341). The SC 200 mg weekl y dose was selected for study BEL112341 because it provides steady -state average belimumab concentrations similar to those in the 10 mg/kg every 4 weeks dose groups, which were positive for the primary endpoint in the pivotal Phase 3 studies of IV belimumab (C1056 and C1057). Arm B will explore the combination of rituximab (2 doses of 1000 mg IV at Weeks 4 and 6) and 51 weeks of belimumab SC dosing. In Arms A a nd B, a pre -medication regimen will be given before each rituximab or rituximab -placebo infusion, including methy lprednisolone 100 mg IV or equivalent , an antihistamine , and an acetaminophen or equivalent . As rituximab is not approved for the treatment of patients with SL E, no standard dosing regimen is established. In this study , rituximab dosing will follow 1 cy cle of the approved dosing recommendation for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) which is 2 IV doses of 1000 mg given in a 2 -week interval. This rituximab regimen demonstrated rapid B cell depletion of CD19 -positive cells (<5 cells/ L) in approximately 90% of subjects b y 2 weeks after the infusions in a large Phase 3 SL E trial [ Merrill , 2010]. Rituximab or rituximab -placebo will be dosed at Weeks 4 and 6, after initiation of belimumab and discontinuation of baseline immunosuppressants. Participants who enter the study on immunosuppressants will have these medications discontinued at or prior to the Week 4 visit. The jus tification for dosing at Week 4 and Week 6 includes: 1) separation of start times for belimumab and rituximab, thereb y allowing for observation of safet y events which may be attributable to starting treatment with the individual agents, and b) evidence tha t belimumab may mobilize B cells into the periphery making them available targets for anti -CD20 treatment, thus starting belimumab prior to rituximab may allow more efficient peripheral B cell depletion by rituximab [ Stohl , 2012]. 6.

Method of Treatment A ssignment All participants will be assigned to study treatment in accordance with the randomization schedule and randomization must occur before any investigational product is administered. Participants will be centrall y randomized using an Interactive Web Response Sy stem (IWRS). Before the study is initiated, the log in information and directions for the IWRS will be provided to each site. A part icipant will be assigned a subject number at the time the informed consent is signed. Once a subject number has been assigned to a participant, it cannot be re -assigned to another participant. A randomization schedule will be generated with the following t reatment assignments: Arm Treatment Description A Belimumab SC for 52 weeks + Rituximab IV Placebo at Weeks 4 and 6 B Belimumab SC for 52 weeks + Rituximab IV 1000 mg at Weeks 4 and 6 C Belimumab SC plus standard therapy for 104 weeks Study treatment will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in the SoA (Section 2). Returned study treatment should not be re -dispensed to the participants. In the event that a subject is unable to attend their planned st udy visit (see Section 2) to receive their carton of belimumab autoinjectors, if allowable under local regulations and approved b y the sponsor , the investigator may with the agreement of the subject arrange to have the autoinje ctors dispensed and shipped direct lyto the subject. At least 280participants will be randomized in a 1:2:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups: belimumab plus rituximab -placebo (Arm A, target N= 70), belimumab plus rituximab (Arm B, target N=1 40), or belimum ab plus standard therap y (Arm C, target N= 70). Randomization of participants will be stratified b y screening SLEDAI -2K score ( 9 vs. 10), immunosuppressant use at screening (immunosuppressant use vs. no use), and screening corticosteroid dose (prednisone equivalent 10 mg/day vs. >10mg/day ). 7.4. Blinding The study is double -blind with regard to whether participants are randomized to Arm A (belimumab plus rituximab -placebo) or Arm B (belimumab plus rituximab). Randomization to Arm C will not be blinded. I n ord er to minimize bias given that Arm C is open -label, independent assessors blinded to treatment group (A, B, or C) will conduct the SL EDAI -2K assessments at selected visits, including those that are components of the primary and major secondary endpoints, o n the schedule provided in the SoA (Section 2)."
63,page_63,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 64Investigators and the Sponsor/Study Team will remain blinded to the results of the B cells subsets because those data could potentially unblind whether or not the participant received rituximab. An unblinded pharmacist will be used at each study site to prepare rituximab and its placebo for IV administration. Unblinded monitors will be assigned to review all pharmacy records, storage, and procedures. The I WRS will b e programmed with blind -breaking instructions. In case of emergency , the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding a participant’s treatment assignment is warranted . Participant safety must alway s be the first consideration in making such a determination. If a participant ’s treatment assignment is unblinded , GSK must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ), as applicable. An unblinded pharmacist at each site will be assigned to use the I WRS randomization software, to order and to receive all drug shipments and notifications. A participant may continue in the study if that participant’s tr eatment assignment is unblinded by the investigator or treating phy sician. The event or condition which led to the unblinding will be recorded in the eCRF. An Independent Data and Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will conduct periodic reviews of unblinded data to ensure external objective and/or statistical review of safety issues (see Section 10.4.4 ). The composition, remit, and procedures of the IDMC are provided in the I DMC Charter. Review and adjudication of treat ment failures, AEs of special interest and protocol deviations will be performed by blinded individuals in preparation for the Week 52and end of study data base locks (DBLs). Subject level data will not be shared with site personnel until after the end of study reporting is complete. GSK’s Global Clinical Safet y and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff may unblind the treatment assignment for any participant with a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) for purposes of regulatory reporting .If the SAE requires that an exp edited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identify ing the participant’s treatment assignment, may be sent to investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or GSK policy . 7.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage /Accountability 1.The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study treatment received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the stud y treatment. 2.Only partic ipants enrolled in the study may receive study treatment and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study treatment. All study treatments must be stored in a secure, environmentall y controlled, and monitored (manual or"
64,page_64,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 65automated) area in accor dance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to authorized unblinded site staff, e.g., unblinded pharmacist. 3.The investigator, institution, the head of the medical institution or delegate (where applicable) is responsible for study treatm ent accountability , reconciliation, and record maintenance (i.e., receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). 4.Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study treatment are provided in the SRM . Under normal condition s of handling and administration, study treatment is not expected to pose significant safet y risks to site staff . Take adequate precautions to avoid direct ey e or skin contact and the generation of aerosols or mists. In the case of unintentional occupation al exposure notify the monitor, Medical Monitor and/or GSK study contact. A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)/equivalent document describing occupational hazards and recommended handling precautions either will be provided to the investigator, where this i s required b y local laws, or is available upon request from GSK. 7.6. Treatment Compliance The first dose of belimumab will be administered by the participant at the clinical site under medical supervision. (Participants may be assisted in administration of their SC dose of belimumab at this first dose and with subsequent doses .) Participants will remain in the clinic for at least 3 hours for observation. The date and time of the dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in the Patient Diary . NOTE -1: If a participant misses a dose of belimumab on the scheduled day of administration , instruct the participant to self -admin ister the missed dose as soon as possible during that dosing week. If subject did not self -administer the dose by end of the weekl y dosing period, SKIP that dose . The participant should not administer two doses on the same day and t wo doses should not be administered to make up for a dose missed for a full 7 day dosing window . Thereafter, the subject can resume self-administering belimumab weekly on their usual day of administration. NOTE -2: If a participant has administered a partial dose or was unable to completely self-administer adose of belimumab due to malfunction of the autoinjector or user error , instruct the subject to SKI Padditio nal attempts and not re -inject for that week’s belimumab dose.Thereafter, the subject should resume self -administering belimumab weekl y on their usual day of administration during the following weekl y dosing period . The participant should not self -adminis ter 2 doses on the same day , even if they believe that they did not receive any medication from the first administration attempt .(See Section 9.7.8 -Device Malfunction) . NOTE 3: Participants who miss 4 or more consecutive doses of belimumab must receive the next dose of belimumab in the clinic and remain in the clinic for at least 3hours for observation as with the initial belimumab dose. The site should contact the Medical Monitor if participants miss 8 or mo re consecutive doses of belimumab to evaluate continuation in the study ."
65,page_65,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 66When participants self -administer study treatment at home, compliance with belimumab will be assessed through review of the self -injection patient diary with each participant during s ite visits and documented in the source. A record of the number of belimumab autoinjectors dispensed to and taken b y each participant must be maintained and reconciled with study treatment and compliance records. Treatment start and stop dates, including d ates for treatment delay s will also be recorded in the eCRF. Rituximab or rituximab -placebo will be administered IV to participants at the site or infusion center, following administration of the premedication regimen. Administration of the premedication r egimen and the rituximab or rituximab -placebo will be documented in the source documents and reported in the eCRF, including whether the full infusion was administered and over what period of time. Study participant identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of the study site staff other than the person administering the study treatment. 7.7. Concomitant Therapy This section reviews the medications and the doses allowed and prohibited during the course of the stud y. Any medication or vacc ine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving from the start of treatment until the follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA must be recorded along with: reason for use dates of administration including start and end dates dosage information including dose and frequency The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are an y questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy . 7.7.1. Allowable Medications Participants must be on a stable SL E treatment regimen for at least 30 day s prior to Day 1 (see Section 6.1). These medications may include corticosteroids, anti -malarial agents, immunosuppressant agents and nonsteroidal ant i-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). New SLE therap y other than corticosteroids must not be added within 60 days of Day 1. Once a participant is randomized and receives the 1st dose of study agent on Day 1, the investigator may adjust concurrent medications (ad d, eliminate, change dose level/frequency ) as clinically required; however, changes in certain medications (as outlined below) may result in the participant being defined as a treatment failure. Rules regarding declaring a participant as a treatment failur e may vary according to timing and are handled differentl y in Arms A and B vs. Arm C. Participants declared treatment"
66,page_66,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 67failures are encouraged to remain in the study and receive all efficacy and safet y assessments through Week 104. 7.7.1.1. Anti-malarials Anti-malar ial therapies for SL E may be continued or dose adjusted during the study , and will be allowed within the definitions of the efficacy endpoints. A new anti -malarial (e.g., hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, quinacrine) may not be started during the course of the study for SLE . Starting any new anti -malarial treatment for SL E after Day 1 will declare the participant a treatment failure. For non -SLE reasons (e.g., for the experimental treatment of COVID -19) an anti -malarial may be initiated for a subject not pre viously on an anti -malarial, or dose increased above the common allowable maximum doses ( defined below )according to the following guidelines ,for short -term treatment : < 21 day s treatment duration Not during the intervals within 8 weeks before the key efficacy visits (actual visit date) at Weeks 52, 64, and 104. An anti -malarial may be replaced by another anti -malarial due to documented toxicity or lack of availability at an y time during the stud y. Thecommon allowable maximum doses of anti -malarial drugs are: Hydroxy chloroquine –400 mg/day Chloroquine –500 mg/day Quinacrine –100 mg/day For compounded anti -malarials, no individual component may exceed the maximum dose above. Clinical loading dose is permitted for initiation or replacement. NOTE: The use of anti -malarials for anti -malarial prophy laxis is permitted. 7.7.1.2. Corticosteroids Received dose for all s ystemic corticosteroids will be converted to prednisone equivalent dose. As such, when “prednisone” is used throughout this protocol, it refers to prednis one dose or equivalent. Total sy stemic corticosteroid dose is defined as the average daily dose of all corticosteroids taken SC, IV, IM, intradermally , and orally for both SL E and non -SLE reasons. At baseline, the average daily dose of corticosteroids is t he sum of corticosteroid dose over 7consecutive days up to, but not including Day 1, divided by 7. While on study"
67,page_67,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 68treatment, the average daily dose of corticosteroids is the sum of all corticosteroid doses over 7 consecutive day s up to and including the d ay of interest, divided by 7, unless otherwise specified. Participants may enter the study on any prescribed dose of corticosteroids. If a participant is not receiving corticosteroid ther apy on study Day 1, once the subject is randomized and receives the 1st dose of study agent on Day 1, the investigator may add corticosteroid medication as clinicall y required (for example, in order to manage the transition period for discontinuing immunosuppressants b y Week 4) .Dosage of corticosteroids may be adjusted as clinicall y necessary until Week 12. After the initial 12 weeks of the study, a protocol specified corticosteroid taper is recommended to begin and should be initiated and conducted under the direction of the investigator. The taper will proceed with a tar get of reaching a prednisone equivalent dose of 5mg/day by Week 26. The recommended corticosteroid taper scheme is described in Appendix 2. Corticosteroids may be adjusted as clinically necessary through Week 26, pa rticipants will not be declared treatment failures unless they are not able to successfull y taper to a 7 -day average prednisone equivalent dose of 5mg/day after Week 26 . For purposes of defining treatment failure, after Week 26, the average daily dose of corticosteroids is the sum of corticosteroid dose on the 7 day s immediately following the Week 26 visit, divided by 7 (the corticosteroid dose on the day of the Week 26 visit is not included in the calculation). After Week 26, if a participant’s average daily dose of corticosteroid exceeds a prednisone equivalent dose of 5mg/day at any time the participant will be declared a treatment failure. (The date of treatment failure will be the end of the 7 -day interval which meets the treatment failure rule.) If the investigator believes the participant would benefit from continued corticosteroid taper after Week 26, and if it is tolerated, a prolonged corticosteroid taper should continue with the goal of discontinuing corticosteroids. Recommendations for the schedule of this taper are included in Appendix 2. Participants who are able to tolerate the final taper will be withdrawn from corticosteroids. If a participant is unable to tolerate the final stage of the corticosteroid taper, the investigator may reinitiate corticosteroids at a prednisone equivalent dose of up to and including 5 mg/day . If a 7-day average prednisone equivalent dose of >5 mg/day is required at an y time after Week 26, the participant will be considered a treatment failure for the efficacy endpoints. Participants who are declared treatment failures are encouraged to remain in the study through Week 104 and receive all safet y and efficacy assessments. For purposes of assessing the major secondary endpoint at Week 64 (the proportion of participants with a state of clinical remission, defined as a Clinical SLEDAI -2K score = 0), achieved without immunosuppressants and with corticosteroids at a prednisone equivalent dose of 0 mg/day at Week 64), participants must be on a dose of 0 mg/day on the 7 day s immediately following the Week 64 visit (the corticosteroid dose on the day of the Week 64 visit is not included in the calculation). Intraarticular Injections: Participants may receive intraarticular injections duri ng the stud y with the exception of within 8 weeks prior to the key efficacy endpoints (i.e., Weeks 52, 64, and 104). A"
68,page_68,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 69participant who receives any intraarticular injection(s) within 8 weeks before the Week 52, 64, and/or 104 visits will be defined as a tr eatment failure . 7.7.1.3. Corticosteroids for Reasons Other Than SLE Disease A ctivity Corticosteroids for non -SLE reasons (e.g., asthma, contact dermatitis, etc) may be given short -term at higher doses than 5mg/day according to the following guidelines: Up to 750 mg (prednisone) for 1 day , and/or Up to 60mg/day (prednisone) for 2 -3 day s , and/or Up to 40 mg/day (prednisone) for 4 -7 day s. After Week 26, the duration of high dose corticosteroids use for reasons other than SLE must not exceed 7 day s, after which tim e, tapering should begin. The total corticosteroid dose must be tapered to 5 mg/day within 21 days of the 1st dose of a course of high dose corticosteroids given for non -SLE reasons. In addition no new high dose corticosteroids for reasons other than SL E are allowed that result in an average corticosteroid dose of >5 mg/day during the intervals starting 8 weeks before the key efficacy visits at Weeks 52, 64, and 104. During the intervals of 8 weeks before these efficacy endpoints, an y new high dose cortico steroid use will declare the participant as a treatment failure. The day of the Week 44, 56, and 96 visits will count as the start of these 3 intervals. NOTE: Inhaled and topical corticosteroids are allowed throughout the course of the study . 7.7.1.4. Other Immuno suppressant A gents Belimumab SC 200 mg/week will be initiated in all treatment arms on Day 1 of the study . Participants who enter the study on immunosuppressant therapy in Arms A and B will continue their stable immunosuppressant regimen until up to Week 4 . At or prior to the Week 4 visit, immunosuppressants will be discontinued. Corticosteroids may be adjusted as necessary during this transition period. Participants in Arm C may continue their immunosuppressant agents throughout the stud y. Starting an y new immunosuppressant agent after Day 1 for increased lupus disease activity will cause the participant to be declared a treatment failure. An immunosuppressant agent may however be replaced with one of the agents listed below due to documented toxicity or la ck of availability . For participants in Arms A and B, the dose of existing immunosuppressant agents may be adjusted, as clinicall y required, up to the Week 4 visit. Any existing immunosuppressant agents will be discontinued at or prior to the Week 4 visit for Arms A and B."
69,page_69,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 70Participants in Arm C may continue their existing immunosuppressant agents throughout the course of the study . Dosage of existing immunosuppressant agents may be increased as clinically necessary until Week 1 2. After the Week 1 2visit, an y increase in dose over the baseline (Day 1) or Week 1 2visit dose, whichever is higher, will cause the participant to be declared a treatment failure. The common allowable maximum doses for immunosuppressant agents at baseline (Day 1) and during the stud yare listed below: Azathioprine –300 mg/day 6-mercaptopurine –300 mg/day Mycophenolate mofetil (PO)/ my cophenolate mofetil hy drochloride (IV) – 4g/day Mycophenolate sodium (PO) –2.88 g/day Methotrexate –25 mg/week Oral cy clophosphamide –2.5 mg/kg/day (Note: use not permitted in Germany ) Cyclosporine –4 mg/kg/day * Tacrolimus –0.2 mg/kg/day * Sirolimus –2 mg/kg/day* Thalidomide –200 mg/day Leflunomide –40 mg/day * Mizoribine –150 mg/day *Clinical loading dose is permitted when replacing immunosuppre ssant agents. Monitor blood levels as clinically indicated. An immunosuppressant agent may be replaced with one of the agents above due to documented toxicity or lack of availability . For other immunosuppressant agents not listed above, the investigator mu st contact the Medical Monitor for approval. New topical immunosuppressive agents (e.g., ey e drops, topical creams) are allowed after Day 1. 7.7.1.5. Nonsteroidal A nti-inflammatory Drugs (NSA IDs), A spirin, and Acetaminophen Since NSAIDs and aspirin may affect effic acy parameters (e.g., arthritis) and may affect renal function (NSAID nephropath y), the use of these agents should be initiated and stabilized prior to entry into the trial. NSAIDs may be continued and dose adjusted as clinically indicated until 8 weeks be fore efficacy visits, i.e., Weeks 52, 64, and 104. During the intervals of 8 weeks before these efficacy endpoints, an y increase in the NSAID dose above the dose at Day 1 or the visit day starting the interval of 8 weeks prior to these key efficacy visits, whichever is higher, will declare the participant as a treatment failure unless the NSAID is given for <7 day s. The day of the Week 44, 56, and 96 visits will count as the start of these 3 intervals."
70,page_70,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 71New NSAIDs may not be added after Day 1 unless given fo r <7 day s. Initiation of an NSAID after Day 1 that is given 7 day s will declare the participant as a treatment failure. An NSAID may be replaced with another NSAID due to documented toxicity or lack of availability . Daily doses of aspirin up to 1000 mg/da y are allowed at an y time during the study . Daily doses of aspirin above 1000 mg/day may be initiated at any time up to the Week 44 visit and may continue through the end of the stud y. For participants who never received an aspirin regimen at a dose >1000 mg/day between the Day 1 and Week 44 visit, starting a new aspirin regimen at a dose >1000 mg/day after the Week 44 visit will declare the participant a treatment failure unless the aspirin is given for <7 day s. Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is primarily an analgesic and lacks the anti -inflammatory properties of other NSAIDs. The use of acetaminophen is recommended when possible to treat non -SLE related conditions, in the absence of a pre -existing hepatic function deficiency . 7.7.2. Prohibited Medications and Non -Drug Therapies Participants who start prohibited medications or therapies at an y time during the stud y will be considered treatment failures for anal ysis (i.e., non -responders). The Medical Monitor must be contacted to discuss the appropriateness of continui ng study treatment. The following medications and therapies are prohibited at any time during the study : Other investigational agents (biologic or non -biologic). Investigational applies to any drug not approved for sale in the country in which it is being used. Co-enrollment into another study of a different investigational agent or that may interfere with the conduct of this protocol. Anti-TNF therap y (e.g., adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab). Other biologics with effects on the immune sy stem (e.g., abata cept, interleukin -1 receptor antagonist [anakinra]). IVIG. IV cyclophosphamide and for German y onl y, oral cy clophosphamide Plasmapheresis. 7.7.3. Live Vaccines Live vaccines are not permitted in the study . Participants who require a live vaccine during the stud y should have study agent discontinued prior to receiving the live vaccine. 7.7.4. Additional SLE Therapy In the 52 -week, double -blind treatment phase, participants in Arms A or B who fail to adequatel y respond to study treatment or in the medical judgment of the i nvestigator"
71,page_71,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 72cannot meet the corticosteroid taper rules, tolerate immunosuppressant withdrawal at Week 4, or who will require additional therap y will be considered treatment failures. Participants who are treatment failures will be encouraged to remain in t he study and receive all safety and efficacy assessments through Week 104. At the discretion of the investigator, the participant may continue to receive belimumab SC 200 mg/week. If additional medical treatment is necessary it will also be at the discreti on of the investigator and may include corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants. In the 52 -week observational phase (Weeks 53 to 104), participants in Arms A and B may continue or reinitiate open -label belimumab SC 200 mg weekl y treatment if (a) they responded clinically in the 52 -week treatment phase of the study but did not meet the primary efficacy endpoint, or (b) responded clinically but subsequentl y experienced an increase in disease activity requiring treatment. If a participant requires rescue the rapy in addition to the re -initiation of treatment with belimumab, corticosteroids >5 mg/day of a prednisone equivalent and/or immunosuppressants may be given at the discretion of the investigator. Reason for rescue therap y and medication dosing requiremen ts should be documented in source records. Treatment with open -label rituximab is allowed, but not encouraged. Belimumab will be provided by the study , but other SLE treatments, including rituximab, will not be provided b y the sponsor . In these situations the participants in Arms A or B would be considered treatment failures for the efficacy endpoints. Participants who are declared treatment failures will be encouraged to remain in the study and continue to receive all safet y and efficacy assessments. Addit ional information on management of participants who receive open -label belimumab and/or rituximab, including the schedule for obtaining immunogenicit y samples, is provided in the SRM. Participants in Arm C will continue to receive belimumab during Weeks 53 to 104. Participants in Arm C who, in the opinion of the investigator, require additional treatment, may receive rescue therapy including corticosteroids >5 mg/day of a prednisone equivalent and/or new, additional or increased immunosuppressants at the investigator's discretion. Treatment with open -label rituximab is allowed, but not encouraged. Other SL E treatments, including rituximab, will not be provided by the study . In these situations, the participants in Arm C would be considered treatment failures for the efficacy endpoints. Participants who are declared treatment failures will be encouraged to remain in the study and continue to receive all safet y and efficacy assessments. Management of additional SL E therapy , including required laboratory tests a nd other procedures, is described in the SRM . 7.8. Treatment after the End of the Study At the end of the stud y, participants who wish to continue treatment with belimumab may do so by being prescribed commerciall y available belimumab."
72,page_72,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 738. DISCONTINUA TION CRIT ERIA 8.1. Withdrawal from the Study Participants are free to withdraw from the stud y at any time, for any reason. Participants may withdraw consent, including use and disclosure of research -related health information at an y time, for an y reason. Participants may be withdrawn/removed, if necessary , by the investigator or the sponsor for safet y, behavioral, administrative, or other reasons. It is understood by all concerned that an excessive rate of withdrawals can render the study uninterpretable; therefore, unnecessa ry withdrawal of participants should be avoided. If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any samples taken, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. In addition, for participants who are WOCBP who receive rituximab or rituximab - placebo at the Week 4 visit, or at both the Weeks 4 and 6 visits, but who discontinue the study prior to the Week 60 visit, maintenance of contraception and monthly telephone calls for urine pregnancy test results will be required until 12 months after the last dose of rituximab or rituximab -placebo was administered. 8.2. Discontinuation of Study Treatment Participants who discontinue study treatment should be encouraged to continue to participate in stud y visits in accordance with the SoA (Section 2), especially all remaining safet y evaluations. If a participant experiences a clinicall y significant AE that the investigator believes may be definitel y, possibly, or probably related to study treatment and could potentially be exacerbated b y the next dose, the investigator may delay study treatment dosing by up to one week or withhold one dose. If a similar concern is present at the time of the next scheduled dose, the investigator should contact the Medical Monitor to determine whether treatment with belimumab or rituximab (or rituximab -placebo) should be postponed further or discontinued. Participants may be withdrawn from study treatment for an y of the following reasons: Prohibited conc urrent medication or therap y or prohibited dose of concurrent medication or therap y (see Section 7.7.2 ). Unacceptable toxicity . Pregnancy willrequire withdrawal from stud y treatment , belimumab and/or rituximab when the pregnancy is recognized. Maintenance of contraception and monthly telephone calls for urine pregnancy test results will be required until 12months after the last dose of rituximab or rituximab -placebo was administered . Participants who become pre gnant during the stud y will be encouraged to remain in the study to be followed for all efficacy and safety assessments including the course and outcome of the pregnancy . If the outcome of the pregnancy occurs after a subject completes or leaves the stud y,attempts"
73,page_73,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 74will be made to obtain follow up information, including the outcome of the pregnancy . NOTE: (German y onl y): Whether rituximab is excreted in human milk is not known. However, because maternal IgG is excreted in human milk, and rituximab was detec table in milk from lactating monkey s, women should not breastfeed while treated with rituximab and for 12 months following rituximab treatment. All participants should be monitored closel y for infection. Participants who develop IgG <250 mg/dL confirmed by repeat test 1 week (>2 day s) after the initial result, will have study treatment withheld, and the investigator must contact the Medical Monitor to determine if stud y treatment should be continued. In addition, increased vigilance for infection is recomme nded in participants who develop IgG <550 mg/dL. Those with a decrease in IgG below 400 mg/dL that is associated with a serious infection (i.e., an infection reported as an SAE) will be withdrawn from study treatment. In addition, if any participant develo ps a life -threatening infection regardless of IgG status, the investigator must contact the Medical Monitor to determine whether study treatment should be continued. Severe skin reactions such as Toxic Epidermal Necroly sis and Stevens -Johnson syndrome, so me with fatal outcome, have been reported with the use of rituximab. I n case of such an event, treatment should be permanently discontinued. A participant will be withdrawn from study treatment if he or she meets liver stopping criteria (defined in Section 8.2.1 ), presents with suicidal ideation of ty pe 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS, or in the investigator's judgment, the participant is at risk for a suicide attempt. Participants who are withdrawn from study treatment wil l remain in the study for observation and continue to have all safety and efficacy assessments. For an y stud y participants exhibiting symptoms consistent with COVI D-19, please consider holding dosing of investigational product (I P) and consult with the Medical Monitor. I f a participant tests positive for COVID -19, or if no testing is available, hold dosing of IP until sy mptoms resolve and contact the Medical Monitor. If a positive COVID -19 test result is reported, please consult with the Medical Monitor on whether resolution of sy mptoms alone, without retesting, is enough to resume dosing of the investigational product . 8.2.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria Liver chemistry stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure participant safety and evaluate liver event etiology . Discontinuation of study treatment is required when : a participant meets one of the conditions outlined in Algorithm A or Algorithm B OR"

Temporary Discontinuation and Re -Start of Belimumab Study treatment with belimumab (Arms A/B and C) must be temporarily withheld and the GSK medical monitor consulted about continued dosing if a subject experiences a neutrophil count <0.5x109/L. Withdrawal of study treatment does not require withdrawal from the study ; participants who discontinue study treatment should be encouraged to continue the study with all safet y and efficacy assessments. Participants who miss 4 consecutive doses of belimumab must ha ve the next dose of belimumab in the clinic and stay for observation for 3 hours."
76,page_76,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 778.4. Withdrawal from the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at an y time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or the sponsor for safet y, behavioral, compliance, administrative or other reasons. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent . If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. Refer to the SoA (Section 2) for data to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed. 8.5. Lost to Follow Up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required stud y visit: The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investig ator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record. Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow -up. 9. STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES Study procedu res and their timing are summarized in the SoA (Section 2). Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awarene ss to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study treatment. Adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct."
77,page_77,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 78All screening evaluations must be completed an d reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable . Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (e.g., blood count) and obtained before signing of ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol -specified criteria and was performed within the time frame defined in the SoA. The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the two year duration of the study for study related assessments, including an y extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 1100 mL,with the exception of additional blood required for the Blood Leukocy te anal ysis as specified below . Additional blood (2 samples of 40 mL each in Year 1 and 2 samples of 40 mL each in Year 2) for the Blood Leukocy te anal ysis will be collected from participants from US study sites. If a participant in the Blood Leukocy te analysis withdraws from the study and completes an Early Withdrawal Visit, a 40 mL sample will be collected at the Early Withdrawal Visit. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safet y reasons or for technical issues with the samples. 9.1. Screening A ssessments Information collected during the screening phase assessments represent key data that identify and define participant baseline status. This information is critical for the evalua tion and comparison of subsequent safet y and efficacy assessments. Informed Consent Informed consent will be obtained from the participant prior to the initiation of any study procedures or stud y-specific data collection. Participants who give written con sent will enter a screening period of up to 35 day s. A participant may be randomized when all screening procedures have been completed and eligibility criteria confirmed. Screening A ssessments During the screening period the following assessments will be performed: Demographic parameters will be captured: year of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity . Medical history /medication will be assessed as related to the exclusion criteria listed in Section 6.2. A complete med ical history will be taken at the Screening Visit. I nformation from the medical history is important to establish the baseline condition of the participant, and will impact the safet y monitoring assessments during the study.

Note: if a subject is unable to attend their scheduled visit, for example as a consequence of restrictions related to the COVID -19 pandemic, for continued safet y monitoring, the investigator should contact the subject b y telephone or video call to review adverse events ( including suicidal ideation/behavior and neurological s ymptoms ), concomitant medications and ongoing SLE treatments including belimumab . These reviews will be documented in the source records and the eCRF .Such telephone/video contacts may be recorded as unscheduled visits. No attempt should be made to perform efficacy assessments at these telephone/video contacts. 9.5. Assessments at Early Withdr awalVisits and Follow -up Visits Participants who discontinue study treatment and withdraw from the study up to Week 52 are required to complete an Early Withdrawal Visit and a Follow -up Visit; the Early Withdrawal Visit is scheduled 1 to 4 weeks after the last dose of belimumab and the Follow -up Visit is scheduled 8 weeks after the last dose of belimumab. Participants in Arms A or B who withdraw from the stud y after Week 52 are required to complete an Early Withdrawal Visit 1 -4 weeks after withdrawal from the study . Participants in Arm C who discontinue study treatment and withdraw from the study after Week 52 are required to complete an Early Withdrawal Visit and a Follow -up Visit; the Early Withdrawal Visit is scheduled 1 to 4 weeks after the last dose of belimumab and the Follow -up Visit is scheduled 8 weeks after the last dose of belimumab. Procedures at the Early Withdrawal Visits and Follow -up Visits are listed in the SoA (Section 2). 9.6.

Details regarding the conduct of the efficacy assessments described below are provided in the SRM . In addition, information from the SL EDAI -2K, PGA, laboratory tests, use and doses of SL E medications, and clinical evaluations will be used to calculate the Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) [ Franklyn , 2016]. SLEDA I-2K The SL EDAI -2K is a clinical index for measuring SLE disease activit y in the previous 10days."
81,page_81,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 82Physician's Global A ssessment The Phy sician's Global Assessment (PGA) is a phy sician -reported visual analogue scale that provides an overall measure of the participant's current disease activity . SLICC -ACR Damage Index The Sy stemic Lupus International Collaborating clinics (SLICC) -American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Damage Index measures irreversibl e changes occurring since the diagnosis of SLE. SLE Flare Index The SL E Flare Index identifies whether a participant has experienced a mild/moderate or severe flare. Lupus Low Disease A ctivity State The Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS) incorporate s multiple measures of disease activity , specifically : SLEDAI -2K 4, with no activity in major organ sy stems (renal, CNS, cardiopulmonary , vasculitis, fever) and no hemol ytic anemia or gastrointestinal activity No new features of lupus disease activity com pared with the previous assessment PGA (scale 0 -3) 1 Current prednisolone (or equivalent) dose 7.5 mg daily Well tolerated standard maintenance doses of immunosuppressive drugs and approved biological agents, excluding investigational drugs. 9.6.1. Patient -Repo rted Outcomes A ssessments Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) questionnaires will be completed b y participants at clinic visits on the schedule outlined in the SoA (Section 2). PRO questionnaires should be completed b y participants, whenever possible before the investigator ’s safet y evaluation and efficacy assessment (e.g., SLEDAI- 2K)at a clinic visit, in the order specified in the SRM. Patient interviews (post -treatment and exit interviews) will be conducted in a subgroup of partic ipants, as described below. Patient Global A ssessment The Patient Global Assessment (PtGA) asks participants to rate the severity of their SL E between 0 ( ) and 10 ( ) that best represents their current level of disease activity . (“Consider ing all of the way s your sy stemic lupus ery thematosus (lupus) affects y ou, how do y ou feel y our lupus is today ?”) CCI CCI"
82,page_82,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 83FACIT-Fatigue The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therap y -Fatigue Scale (FACI T-Fatigue) version 4.0 includes 13 fatigue -related it ems that ask patients to rate fatigue during the previous 7 day s, yielding an overall score from 0 to 52 , with lower scores representing worse fatigue (www.facit.org). The use of the FACI T-fatigue scale in SLE patients has been validated by Lai et al [Lai, 2011] and together with results from other studies including Cella and colleagues [ Cella , 2005] , anMCI D of ≥4 was concluded [Lai, 2011]. LupusQoL The LupusQoL is a valid SL E-specific health related qualify of life (HRQOL) instrument with 34 questions across 8 domains. Questions are related to the patient experience in the prior 4 we eks, and a 5- point L ikert response format is used, ranging from 0 ( to 4 ( ) . A LupusQoL summary score for each domain is reported on a 0 to 100 scale, with greater values indicating better HRQOL [ McElhone , 2007]. WPA I: Lupus The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI) is a measure of overall work impairment that discerns time missed from work and impairment of work and regular activities due to a specific disease or health problem. WPAI outcomes include work time missed, impairment while working, overall work productivity impairment and activity impairment expressed as impairment percentages with higher percentages imply ing greater impairment and less productivity [Reill y, 1993]. The WPAI : Lupus reflects the impairments due to lupus. Patient Interviews Patient interviews will provide a qualitative summary of participants' experience of treatment benefits, treatment satisfaction, and experience as a stud y participant. Adverse events will not be solicited during the interview however, if a nSAE is described by the participant, it will be collected and processed according to GSK required timelines and procedures .These interviews will be conducted in a subgroup of participants in the US at the Week 52 and Week 104 study visits (or upon early withdrawal after Week 12 ). Interview questions designed to fully assess a participant 's experience with a study medication will be administered in a sem i-structured format b y a trained interviewer. Participant feedback will be captured in a data collection sheet as well as being audio - taped for subsequent transcription and qualitative anal ysis. The interview technique and questions will be described in th e SRM . 9.7. Adverse Events The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Appendix 7 . The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the study , or that caused the participant to discontinue the study treatment (see Section 8).

83,page_83,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 849.7.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting A E and SA E Information All SAEs will be collected from the start of treatment until the follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2).However, any SAEs assessed as related to stud y participation (e.g., stud y treatment, protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a GSK product will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study . All AEs will be collected from the start of treatment until the follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2). Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the case report form (CRF) not the AE section. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and under no circumstance sho uld this exceed 24hours, as indicated in Appendix 7 . The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAE s in study participants after completion of their participation in the study . However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, including a death, at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event to be reason ably related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor. The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are p rovided in Appendix 7 . 9.7.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method t o inquire about AEoccurrence. 9.7.3. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and non -serious and serious AEs of special interest (AESI ) (i.e., infections, malignancies, and depression/suicidality /self- injury ) will be followed until the event is resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.5). Further information on follow - up procedures is given in Appendix 7 . 9.7.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obl igations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of"
84,page_84,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 85participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a stud y treatment under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees (I EC), and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary . An inves tigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safet y information e.g., summary or listing of SAE sfrom the sponsor will review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 9.7.5. Cardiovascular and Death Events For an y cardiovascular events detailed in Appendix 7 and all deaths , whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of t he CRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardiovascular death. The CV CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the CRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. The Death CRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. I nitial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. 9.7.6. Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study treatment and until 16 weeks after the last dose of belimumab or 12 months (i.e., Week 58) after the last dose of rituximab/rituximab -placebo, whichever is later. If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform GSK within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the proced ures outlined in Appendix 3 . Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAEs. 9.7.7. Medical Device Incidents Medical devices (i.e., belimumab autoinjector) are provided for use in this study for the purposes of self -administration of study treatment. I n order to fulfill regulatory reporting obligations worldwide, the investigator is responsible for the detection and"

Device Malfunction Medical devices (Belimumab Autoinjector) that are provided for use in this study for the purposes of self -administration of study treatment may malfunction during use (e.g., parts missing, device leaking, needle bent). The i nformation provided in this section applies to occurrence and reporting of device malfunctions that are NOT associated with an AE/SAE. If when using an autoinjector ,the subject experiences a device malfunction, the participant should stop using the device and SKIP additional attempts and not re -inject for that week’s belimumab dose. (See N OTE -1in Section 7.6for additional instruction regarding administration of study treatment following a device malfunction). The subject should record the malfunction in the Smartphone and contact the site the same day or as soon a spossible to report the device malfunction. The study site sh ould record the malfunction on the Device Malfunction /Failure Reporting Form (see form in the SRM ) and forward the information to GSK as described on the form by the next business day . The subje ct should retur nthatmalfunctioned device to the study site at the next scheduled visit for shipment back to GSK for evaluation. 9.8. Treatment of Overdose For this study , any dose of belimumab greater than 200 mg per week will be considered an overdose. Ther e is limited experience with overdosage of belimumab. Adverse reactions reported in association with cases of overdose have been consistent with those expected for belimumab. Two doses up to 20 mg/kg administered 21 day s apart by IV infusion have been give n to humans with no increase in incidence or severit y of adverse reactions compared with doses of 1, 4, or 10 mg/kg. GSK does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose of belimumab. For this study , any dose of rituximab in excess of 1000 mg IV withi n a 24 hour period will be considered an overdose. There has been no experience of overdosage with rituximab. GSK does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose of rituximab. In the event of a belimumab and/or rituximab overdose, the investigator sh ould: 1.Contact the Medical Monitor immediately ."
87,page_87,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 882.Closely monitor the participant for AEs/SAEs 3.Document the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the inve stigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 9.9. Safet y Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (Section 2). 9.9.1. Physical Examinations The full phy sical examination at screening will include complete assessment of all organ s ystems including assessments of the head and neck (including eyes, ears, nose, throat, and thy roid gland), skin, musculoskeletal (including evaluation of both small and large joints), neurological, respiratory , and cardiovascular s ystems, gastrointestinal s ystem, and abdomen (including liver and spleen), l ymph nodes and extremities. A symptom -driven phy sical examination at the scheduled and unscheduled clinic visits w ill include, at a minimum, assessments of eyes, mouth, skin, lungs, cardiovascular s ystem, abdomen and extremities (including joints). Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 9.9.2. Vital Signs Blood pre ssure and pulse measurements will be assessed with a completel y automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not available. Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be preceded b y at least 5minutes of rest for the pa rticipant in a quiet setting without distractions (e.g., television, cell phones). Vital signs will be measured in a semi -supine position after 5 minutes rest and will include temperature, sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure, and pulse. 9.9.3. Electrocardiogra ms A single 12 -lead ECG will be obtained during screening using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals. 9.9.4. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments Refer to Appendix 9 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA for the timing and frequency ."
88,page_88,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 89The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record an y clinicall y relevant changes occurring during the stu dy in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged b y the investigator to be mor e severe than expected for the participant's condition. All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantl y abnormal during participation in the study or within 60 day s after the last dose of study treatment should be repeated until the va lues return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered significantly abnormal by the investigator or medical monitor. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable b y the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified. All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 9 , must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA. 9.9.5. Neurological A ssessment A quest ionnaire -based neurological examination to detect any signs or s ymptoms consistent with the diagnosis of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) will be conducted b y the investigator or designated site staff at each visit. If a question is answere d 'yes' and the reason for the s ymptom is unknown (i.e., is not definitively explained by other known cause), the participant will be referred to a neurologist for evaluation and the medical monitor contacted within 24 hours. An MRI with gadolinium enhance ment (pending renal function evaluation) and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) JCV PCR is recommended to be performed to confirm the diagnosis of PML, if suspected . 9.9.6. Suicidal Risk Monitoring There have been some reports of suicidal ideation or behavior s ymptoms , as reported in the product label in some patients being treated with belimumab for SL E. GSK considers it important to monitor for such events before and during clinical studies with compounds such as this. Participants being treated with belimumab should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for suicidal ideation and behavior or any other unusual changes in behavior. Consideration should be given to discontinuing belimumab in participants who experience signs of suicidal ideation or behavior. Families and caregivers (where appropriate and at the discretion of the participant) of participants being treated with belimumab should be alerted about the need to monitor participants for the emergence of unusual changes in behavior, as well as the emerg ence of suicidal ideation and behavior and to report such sy mptoms immediately to the study investigator. Baseline assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior AND treatment emergent suicidal ideation and behavior will be assessed during Study 205646 using C-SSRS. I t is"
89,page_89,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 90recommended that the Investigator consider mental health consultation or referral for subjects who experience signs of suicidal ideation or behavior. The Medical Monitor should be notified when these events occur. In addition, a “y es” to any suicidal behavior or ideation question on the C -SSRS prompts the completion of the Possible Suicidality Related Questionnaire (PSR Q).Details of the C -SSRS and PSRQquestionnaires will be provided in the SRM . 9.10. Pharmacokinetics Blood samples of approximatel y 2mLeach will be collected for measurement of serum concentrations of belimumab or rituximab, respectivel y, as specified in the SoA. Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided b y the sponsor. The actual date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each sample will be recorded. Samples will be used to evaluate the pharmacokinetics ( PK)of belimumab or rituximab. For each belimumab and rituximab PK sample collection the following is required: collect 2 mL whole blood into a 2 mL serum blood collection tube. Specimen will be allowed to clot and the tube then centrifuged at approximately 1600 g for 15 minutes at room temperature to separate the clot from the serum. The resultant serum will be transferred to appropriately labe led 1.8 mL polypropylene tubes. Samples collected for analy ses of belimumab or rituximab serum concentrations may also be used to evaluate safety or efficacy aspects related to concerns arising during or after the study . Genetic anal yses will not be perfor med on these serum samples. Drug concentration information that would unblind the study will not be reported to investigative sites or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded. 9.11. Pharmacody namics Blood Leukocy te Analysis Blood sample sfor B cell analysis will be collected as indicated in the SoA (Section 2). B cell flow cy tometry panels will be used to measure changes over the course of therapy in blood cells, B cells and B cell subsets including but no t limited to: the transitional, naive, memory , activated and plasma B cell compartments. For subsets of interest, absolute numbers of cells and proportions relative to all B cells will be determined. Further Research Further research samples are optional a nd will be reported separate from the Clinical Study Report (CSR) including but not limited to: Additional blood samples for further B cell research will be collected from subjects at select European study sites as indicated in the SoA (Section 2)."

Medical Resource Utilization and Health Economics Health care resource utilization (HCRU ) data will be collected for all participants throughout the stud y. Participants will be asked to record medical encounters each week (see SoA, Section 2). Protocol -mandated medical resource utilization is exclu ded. The investigator and clinical site staff will review the reported HCRU at each visit . The data will be used to conduct exploratory economic analy ses and will include: Number of outpatient/hospital clinic visits Number of emergency room /urgent care fac ilityvisits Number and duration of in -patient hospitalizations (total nights, including duration by wards [intensive care unit vs. general ward]) Use of over the counter (non -prescription) medication. 10. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS 10.1. Hypotheses The primary obje ctive of the study is to demonstrate superiority (improvement in response rate) of co -administration of belimumab plus rituximab (Arm B: Combination) over belimumab monotherap y (Arm A: Control), when comparing the primary efficacy endpoint at Week 52 in su bjects with SL E. An exploratory assessment of the relative performance of Arm A (control) and Arm B (combination) vs. standard SLE therapy (Arm C) will also be conducted. The primary efficacy endpoint is defined as: the proportion of participants with a st ate of disease control defined as a SL EDAI -2K score 2, achieved without immunosuppressants and with corticosteroids at a prednisone equivalent dose of 5mg/day at Week 52. Null Hypothesis (H 0): There is no difference between Arm B (combination) and Arm A (control) in terms of the primary endpoint at Week 52. Alternative Hypothesis (H 1): There is a difference between Arm B (combination) and Arm A (control) in terms of the primary endpoint at Week 52. A step -down sequential testing procedure will be used to control the overall ty pe 1 error rate for comparing Arm B (combination) vs Arm A (control). With this procedure, the primary endpoint will be evaluated first and then the two major secondary endpoints (i.e., Clinical SLEDAI 2K score =0 at Week 64 next a nd then SL EDAI -2K score 2 at Week 104) for statistical significance based on the pre -specified sequence for interpretation. Specificall y, endpoints will be tested in the sequence above (2 -sided alpha=0.05) provided that statistical significance is achieve d by all prior tests. If at any point in the"
92,page_92,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 93sequence statistical significance is not met, then subsequent endpoints in the sequence cannot be deemed statistically significant. Anal yses of other efficacy endpoints will not be subject to an y multiple compar ison procedure. 10.1.1. Analysis for Marketing A pplication Primary Analysis A statistical anal ysis will be completed once all participants have completed 52 weeks of the study , if feasible .If the Week 52 database freeze is delay ed due to COVID -19 pandemic ,the ti ming of the Week 52 reporting may be reviewed and changes will be documented in the RAP. End of Study Analysis After the initial 52 week double -blind phase, participants in Arms A and B will enter into the 52 -week double blind treatment -free, observational phase of the stud y (Weeks 53 through 104). Participants in Arm C will continue to receive belimumab SC and standard therap y, which may include their stable immunosuppressants, during Weeks 53 through 104. A final anal ysis will be conducted following the c ompletion of Week 104 . 10.2. Sample Size Determination In order to ensure adequate exposure for evaluation of safet y, the stud y is designed with a target of 140 participants to be randomized into the combination arm. At least 280partic ipants will be randomised in this study , with a target of 70 participants in Arm A, 140 participants in Arm B and 70 participants in Arm C. This sample size provides at least 9 8% power (for the comparison of Arm B to Arm A at Week 52) at the 5% level of significance assuming the un derly ing response in the control arm is 10% and the true population effect is 25% with treatment Arm B (combination assumed response rate of 35%). The primary endpoint will be based on assuming study dropouts = treatment failures, and so the assumed respo nder rates for treatment Arms A and B alread y account for participant dropout rates. However , the sample size may be increased up to a maximum of 320 participants if the dropout rate, missing data or number of major protocol deviations suggests further participants are necessary to ensure robust conclusions can be drawn .Sample size was calculated using PASS 12 and is based in the Likelihood ratio test. No inferential tests are planned between Arm C and Arm A or Arm B; therefore no adjustment for multiplici ty is required. There are limited clinical data with therapies including both belimumab and rituximab. Based on elicitation of opinion from external experts, as well as the rarit y of remission or disease control seen in published external studies and inte rnal GSK review of previous belimumab data, a rate of 35% achieving a state of disease control (i.e., Arm B) is considered to be highl y significant in SLE care. The assumed 10% responder rate in Arm A (control) at 52 weeks was estimated based on exploratio n of historical data from three comparable belimumab Phase 3 trials (IV: C1056 [BLISS -76] and C1057 [BLISS -52] and SC: BEL112341) in patients with SL E, albeit with some significant differences from this study in protocol inclusion criteria, control of back ground therap y for SL E, SLEDAI -2K derivation and treatment failure rules. The estimated Arm A"
93,page_93,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 94(control) response rates based on data from previous belimumab Phase 3 studies ranged from 3.3% (C1056), 7.3% (C1057), and 8.3% (BEL 112341). It is appreciated tha t these rates are derived from studies that did not include a forced steroid or immunosuppressant taper. Due to the limitations of the historical data and therefore the likel y imprecision of the estimated responder rates, a more conservative estimate of th e assumed belimumab monotherap y arm of 10% is being used for sample size calculations. Assuming a 10% control responder rate and 70 participants in Arm A and 140participants in Arm B, the minimum detectable effect (MDE) at p -value <0.05 is a 11% improveme nt (i.e., an observed improvement with the combination of 1 1% or more would give a p -value <0.05). Sample Size Sensitivity A sample size sensitivity anal ysis was conducted on the primary endpoint, to investigate the impact on power if the assumed underly ing control response rate deviates from 10% or the treatment difference deviates from 25%. The results of these anal yses are display ed in Table 5. Table 5 Power if the Underly ing Response Rat es Vary from 10% (Control) and 35% (Combination)a Control Rate (Arm A) Combination Rate (Arm B) Power 5% 30% 99% 15% 40% 97% 10% 25% 75% 10% 30% 93% 10% 40% 99% a. All calculations assume a 5 % level of significance, N= 70 (control), N=1 40 (combination). 10.3. Populations for A nalyses For purposes of analy sis, the following populations are defined: Population Description Enrolled All participants who sign the ICF. Randomized All participants who are randomized. This population will be comprised of participan ts according to the treatment that a participant was randomized to receive, regardless of the actual treatment received. Intent -To-Treat (ITT)All randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment.

94,page_94,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 95Population Description To-Treat (MITT) treatment will be included. Arm C: All randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment and for whom their independent blinded assessor was not potentially unblinded (i.e. ,enrolled after 07SEPT 2018) will be included. This population will be comprised of participants according to the treatment that a participant was randomized to receive, regardless of the actual treatment received. Per-Protocol (PP)All randomized participants who receive at least one dose of study treatment excluding par ticipants with major protocol deviations with potential to impact efficacy assessments. All further populations to be used for the assessment of health outcomes, biomarkers and pharmacokinetics data will be defined in the RAP. 10.4. Statistical A nalyses Follow ing an assessment of the impact of COVID -19 on the planned estimands, it may be necessary to update existing estimands or add new estimands. Where required, details of these anal yses will be included in the RAP. 10.4.1. Efficacy Analyses Unless otherwise stated, t he primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints will be conducted using the: MITT population Blinded independent assessors SL EDAI -2K data Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods Primary Endpoint: The proportion of participants with a state of disease contro l defined as a SLEDAI 2K -score ≤2, achieved without immunosuppressants and with corticosteroids at a prednisone equivalent dose of 5mg/day at Week 52. (Arm B: combination vs Arm A control) Analysis: The proportion of subjects achieving a treatment respon se (as defined for the primary endpoint) at Week 52 will be compared between Arm B (combination) vs Arm A (control) using a logistic regression model. The independent variables in the model will include treatment group, baseline SLEDAI -2K score ( 9 vs. 10mg/day), immunosuppressant use at baseline (immunosuppressant use vs. no use), and baseline corticosteroid dose"
95,page_95,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 96Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods (prednisone equivalent 10 mg/day vs. 10 mg/day). If any factor fails to converge it will be removed from the logistic model. If the logistic model fails to converge, e.g., due to a small number of responders, the primary endpoint will be analyzed using a Fishers exact test. Missing data for the primary endpoint will be handled as follows: The study is designed to continue to collect data for p articipants who prematurely discontinue from their randomized treatment. All data on the primary endpoint collected for these participants will be included in the primary analysis, irrespective of whether they are classified as ‘on -treatment ‘ or not. For participants who withdraw prematurely from study treatment and for whom subsequent collection of data is not possible, it will be assumed for the primary analysis that they are treatment failures. A dropout/treatment failure = non -responder (DO/TF=NR) anal ysis will be used, therefore no missing data will be assumed as all participants will be classed as either a non-responder or responder. The basic premise of the DO/TF=NR analysis is that a participant meeting any of treatment failure criteria defined belo w (prior to Week 52), will be considered a treatment failure and thus counted as a non-responder in the statistical analysis: Received protocol prohibited medication, including non -study rituximab, prior to Week 52; Received immunosuppressants after Week 4 ; Received a prednisone equivalent corticosteroid dose of >5 mg/day after Week 26; Withdrew from the study prior to Week 52. Sensitivity Analysis: Sensitivity analyses will be defined in the RAP and will explore the impact of missing data and treatment fa ilure imputation. Secondary (First Major)Endpoint :The proportion of participants with a state of clinical remission defined as a Clinical SLEDAI -2K score =0, achieved without immunosuppressants and corticosteroids at a prednisone equivalent dose of 0 m g/day at Week 64. (Arm B: combination vs Arm A control) Note: For purposes of theMajor Secondary Endpoint, Clinical SLEDAI -2K is scored similar to the SLEDAI -2K but exclud esserological activity scores , i.e., anti - dsDNA positivity and/or hypocomplementemi a. Analysis: The proposed statistical analyses planned for the primary endpoint will be repeated for the first major secondary endpoint. The following treatment failure criteria (prior to Week 64) will be used: 1. Received protocol prohibited medication, inc luding non -study rituximab, prior to Week 64; 2.

Details, including treat ment failure rules for Arm C, will be described in the RAP. 10.4.2. Safety Analyses All safet y anal yses will be performed on the ITT Population. Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods Secondary Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize AEs, SAEs, AEs of special interest (AESI), changes in laboratory parameters, and immunogenicity (both anti - belimumab and anti -rituximab antibodies will be assessed). The frequency of laboratory abnormalities will be tabulated by treatment group. The frequency of AEs will be tabulated by MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and preferred term and compared between treatment arms. 10.4.3.

97,page_97,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 9810.4.4. Interim A nalyses There are no formal planned interim anal yses. An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will review unblinded safet y data on an ongoing basis until all participants have completed the 104 week study (after which monitoring may be assumed by an intern al GSK committee). The IDMC will include physicians with relevant clinical expertise and a statistician, none of whom is affiliated with the sponsor. The 1st IDMC data review meeting will occur after approximately 60participants have been randomized (appr oximately 15 in each of Arms A and C and approximately 30 in Arm B) and completed 12 weeks of study treatment OR approximately 6 months after the treatment of the 1st participant, whichever is earlier . After the initial review, the IDMC will review the dat a approximately every 6 months . For coordination with other ongoing IDMC activities, the initial meeting may be scheduled prior this milestone, and then will resume the above described schedule (approximately every 6 months). Ad hoc meetings of the IDMC ca n also be requested as needed to review urgent safet y information or AEs. Events to be monitored during the safet y review will include at a minimum all SAEs (including deaths, serious psychiatric events, and serious infections), Grade 3 and Grade 4 laborat ory abnormalities, opportunistic infections (serious and nonserious), malignancies, and hypersensitivity /anaph ylactic reactions during the double -blind treatment phase (Year 1) and double -blind observational phase (Year 2) for Arms A & B and open -label tre atment phase (Years 1 and2) for Arm C . Investigators and I RBs/IECs will be notified of the outcome of each IDMC meeting. In addition, the IDMC will receive information within 72 hours of all SAEs that are life threatening or result in death. Other SAEs , all opportunistic infections, irrespective of relationship to study treatment , and protocol specified events (i.e., IgG <250 mg/dL) will be provided to the IDMC bi-weekl y for review."

Taper Phase 1 will occur under the direction of the investigator between study Weeks 12 and 26 with a target prednisone equivalent corticosteroid dose of 5 mg/day by study Week 26. Participants who cannot tolerate prednisone equivalent corticosteroid dose of 5mg/day after Week 26 will be considered treatment failures. Participants who are deemed treatment failures will be encouraged to remain in the study and continue to have all efficacy and safet y assessments. The recommended corticosteroid taper schedule for Phase 1 is outlined in Table 6. Common corticosteroid doses and prednisone equivalents are presented in Table 7. Adjus tments may be made for tolerability at the investigator’s discretion.

In order to attempt to discontinu e participants’ corticosteroids a prolonged prespecified taper will be employ ed. A decrease of 1 mg/day on one day per week is recommended until a participant is decreased to 0 mg/day. For example, the first week of this taper a participant who was receivi ng a prednisone equivalent corticosteroid dose of 5 mg/day will receive 4 mg on Monday and 5 mg/day from Tuesday through Sunday . In the second week of the taper the participant will receive 4 mg on Monday and Tuesday and then 5 mg/day from Wednesday throug h Sunday , etc until the participant is on 0 mg/day . Thus, the discontinuation of 5 mg/day would take 35 weeks to accomplish."

A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient. Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the non -hormonal highl y effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the stud y. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment.

If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. Sexual abstinence Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifesty le of the participant. NOTES: a. Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants in clinical studies. b. Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the standard of care medications, which may reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive method. In this case two highly effective methods of contraception should be utilized during the treatment period and for at least 16 weeks after the last dose of belimumab and/or monthly until 12 months after the last dose of rituximab or placebo, whichever is later. If stricter female or male contraception requirements are specified in the country -specific label for in duction and/or maintenance standard of care medications, they must be followed.

Appendix 6 :Liver Safety Study Treatment Restart Guidelines Restart Following Transient Resolving Liver Stopping Events Not Related to Study Treatment Restart refers to resuming stud y treatment following liver stopping events in which there is a clear underl ying cause (other than DILI) of the liver event (e.g., biliary obstruction, pancreatic events, hy potension, acute viral hepatitis). Furthermore, restart is not permitted following liver stopping event when the underl ying cause was alcoholic hep atitis . Approval b y GSK for study treatment restart can be considered where: Investigator requests consideration for stud y treatment restart if liver chemistries have a clear underl ying cause (e.g., biliary obstruction, hy potension and liver chemistries ha ve improved to normal or are within 1.5 x baseline and AL T <3xUL N). Possible study treatment -induced liver injury has been excluded by the investigator and the study team. This includes the absence of markers of h ypersensitivity (otherwise unexplained feve r, rash, eosinophilia). Where a study treatment has a confirmed genetic marker associated with liver injury , the presence of the marker should be excluded. There is no evidence of alcoholic hepatitis. IRB/IEC approval of study treatment restart has been o btained. If restart of study treatment is approved by GSK in writing: The participant must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of study treatment administration including the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver injury or death. The participant must also provide signed informed consent specifically for the restart of study treatment. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study file. Study treatment must be administered at the dose specified by GSK Participants approved b y GSK for restart of stud y treatment must return to the clinic twice a week for liver function tests until stable liver function tests have been demonstrated and then standard laboratory monitoring may resume as per protocol. If the participant meets protocol -defined liver function stopping criteria after study treatment restart, study treatment should be permanently discontinued. GSK Medical Monitor, and the I RB/IEC, must be informed of the outcome for the participant followi ng study treatment restart. GSK must be notified of any adverse events, as per Appendix 7 ."

Appendix 7 :Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting Definition of A E AE Definition An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unin tended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemis try, or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (i.e., not re lated to progression of underl ying disease). Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administra tion even though it may have been present before the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concom itant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigato r to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of"
116,page_116,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 117the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. Medic al or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscop y, appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. Definition of SA E If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hosp italization for signs/sy mptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease). A SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hy potheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the ph ysician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” oc curred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d.Results in persistent disability/incapacity The term disability mea ns a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and a ccidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e.Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect"
117,page_117,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 118f.Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical i ntervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for aller gic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Definition of Cardiovascular Events Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition: Investigators will be required to fill o ut the specific CV event page of the CRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrh ythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack Peripheral a rterial thromboembolism Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism Revascularization Recording A E and SA E AE and SAE Recording  When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory , and diagnostics reports) related to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF. It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records to GSK in lieu of c ompletion of the GSK /AE/SAE CRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are"
118,page_118,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 119requested b y GSK. In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to GSK. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/sy mptoms) will be docu mented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate: An event that causes sufficiently discomfort and interferes with normal every day activities. Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assess ed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as desc ribed in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. Assessment of Causality  The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relationship convey s that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as underl ying dis ease(s), concomitant therap y, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Produc t Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may be situations in which an SAE has o ccurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK . The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality"
119,page_119,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 120assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting r equirements. Follow -up of AE and SAE  The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate the nature and/or causalit y of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized f ollow - up period, the investigator will provide GSK with a cop y of an y post-mortem findings including histopathology . New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK withi n 24 hours of receipt of the information. Reporting of SA E to GSK SAE Reporting to GSK via Electronic Data Collection Tool  The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to GSK will be the electronic data collection tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailabl e, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section) in order to report the event within 24 hours . The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes available. The investigator or medically -qualifi ed sub -investigator must show evidence within the eCRF (e.g., check review box, signature, etc.) of review and verification of the relationship of each SAE to I P/study participation (causalit y) within 72 hours of SAE entry into the eCRF. After the stud y iscompleted at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section) or to the SAE coordinator b y telephone."
120,page_120,"2016N272781_11 CONFIDENTIA L 205646 121SAE Reporting to GSK via Paper CRF  If the electroni c system is unavailable for more than 24 hours, then facsimile transmission of the SAE paper CRF is the preferred method to transmit this information to the SAE coordinator . In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by telephone is acceptable with a cop y of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or courier service. Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated rep orting time frames."

Variable response to therap y ma y be due to genetic determinants that impact drug ab sorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; mechanism of action of the drug; disease etiology ; and/or molecular subty pe of the disease being treated. Therefore, where local regulations and I RB/IEC allow, a blood sample will be collected for DNA anal ysis DNA samples may be used for research related to belimumab, rituximab, or any concomitant medicines, or sy stemic lupus ery thematosus (SL E) and related diseases. They may also be used to develop tests/assay s including diagnostic tests related to belimum ab, rituximab, or any concomitant medicines, and SLE. Genetic research may consist of the anal ysis of one or more candidate genes or the anal ysis of genetic markers throughout the genome [or anal ysis of the entire genome] (as appropriate) DNA samples may be analy zed if it is hy pothesized that this may help further understand the clinical data or the disease under study . The samples may be analy zed as part of a multi -study assessment of genetic factors involved in the response to belimumab, rituximab, or st udy treatments of these drug classes. The results of genetic anal yses may be reported in the clinical study report or in a separate study summary . The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidenti ality. The samples will be retained while research on belimumab, rituximab or SLE continues but no longer than 15 y ears after the last subject last visit or other period as per local requirements."
