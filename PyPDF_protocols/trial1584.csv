13,page_13,"Novartis Confidential Page 14 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2301 1 Introduction 1.1 Background Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common retinal vascular permeability disorder after diabetic retinopath y and is a significant cause of visual impairment. The 5-year, 10-year and 15-year incidences of RVO have been estimated as 0.8, 1.6 and 2.3 per 100 persons, respectivel y (Klein et al2000; Cugati et al 2006 ; Klein et al 2008 ). Macular edema (ME) is the most common cause of vision loss in patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). In an in vivo model, it has been demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can increase vascular permeabilit y (Aiello et al 1994) and that intraocular levels of VEGF in the eyes with RVO are elevated (Campochiaro etal2009 ). Previous and current available therapies Until the approval of ranibizumab, the management of ME associated with RVO was largel y based on the results from the Branch Vein Occlusion Study and the Central Vein Occlusion Study , where laser treatment in BRVO was shown to slow the progression of vision loss (TheBranch Vein Occlusion Study 1984 ; Finkelstein 1986). Laser photocoagulation was then the standard of care in patients with BRVO despite many patients failing to gain vision. Pharmacologic treatment of RVO began with the use of corticosteroids and the approva l of the intravitreal dexamethasone sustained -release implant (Ozurdex®) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2009 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2010 (Haller et al 2010 ). More recently ,anti-VEGF therapies have revolutionized the treatment of ME secondary to RVO and are currently the standard of care in this indication as VEGF is a major mediator for ME in RVO. The most commonly used VEGF inhibitors, i.e. bevacizumab (Avastin®), aflibercept (Eylea®) and ranibizumab (Lucentis®) have demonstrated compelling evidence for resolution of ME and improvement of visual acuity (VA) subsequent to the treatment with an anti-VEGF ( Rabena et al 2007 ; Campochiaro et al 2010 ; Clark et al 2016 ). Ranibizumab (0.5 mg) was globall y approved (2010 by the FDA, 2011 by the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (CHMP) and 2013 by the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA)) for the treatment of ME due to BRVO and CRVO, based on the results of 2 Phase III studies (BRAVO for BRVO and CRUI SE for CRVO) (Campochiaro et al 2010; Brown etal 2010). These studies showed that approximately 60% of BRVO and 48% of CRVO patients treated with monthly ranibizumab gained at least 15 letters of VA at 6 months, compared with 29% and 17% of those treated with sham, respectivel y. The VA gain was maintai ned on average until Month 12 using a pro re nata (PRN) treatment regimen, which was based on VA and anatomic parameters. Aflibercept (2 mg) was approved for the treatment of ME following RVO at a global level (2014 by the FDA, 2015 by the CHMP and PMDA) based on the results of 3 Phase III studies: COPERNI CUS and GALILEO for CRVO (Pielen et al 2017 ) and VIBRANT for BRVO (Clark et al 2016 ). In these studies, approximately 60% of CRVO patients treated with monthl y aflibercept gained ≥ 15 letters from baseline versus 17% in the sham group. Approximately"
14,page_14,"Novartis Confidential Page 15 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2301 53% of BRVO patients treated with monthly aflibercept gained ≥ 15 letters from baseline versus 27% in the laser group. Currently available anti-VEGF treatments require frequent regular intravitreal (IVT) injections, which can be burdensome to patients and health care professionals. Therefore, an unmet medical need to reduce the treatment burden with an effective alternative still exists. Brolucizumab Brolucizumab, formerl y known as RTH258 and ESBA1008, is a humanized single -chain fragment variable (scFv) that binds to VEGF -A (i.e. interferes with activation of VEGF -R1 and R2 on endothelial cells) with a molecular weight of ~26 kDa. It is als o being developed for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with neurovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). The characteristics of brolucizumab allow delivery of a high molar dose via intravitreal injection. Higher mola r doses are expected to lead to longer presence of relevant drug levels in the retina. In addition, a low molecular weight and high concentration gradient between the vitreous and the retina may increase and prolong drug distribution to the target site of action, supporting longer effective control of disease activity . This could potentially translate into a more durable efficacy and a reduced treatment burden (number of injections) for the patient and health care professional. Brolucizumab in nAMD In a single ascending dose Phase I study (C-10- 083), the median time until patients fulfilled protocol defined criteria for receipt of standard of care treatment was 30 days longer for brolucizumab 6 mg (P = 0.036) versus ranibizumab, with the maximum effect on b est-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central subfield thickness (CSFT) reached at Week 6 for brolucizumab versus Week 4 for ranibizumab. In a separate repeat dosing Phase II study (C - 12-006, OSPREY) comparing brolucizumab 6 mg (n = 44) every 8 weeks (q8w ), then every 12 weeks (q12w) administration, i.e. administration every q8w and q12w, respectivel y, against aflibercept (q8w administration, n = 45), brolucizumab achieved comparable visual outcome during the loading and q8w phase, with a lower number of p atients requiring additional rescue treatments (5 out of 44 versus 10 out of 45, respectively). Brolucizumab demonstrated a trend for greater improvements and more stability in retinal anatomy during the 4cycles of q8w dosing (up to Week 40), e.g. simulta neous resolution of intraretinal and subretinal fluid which was achieved in 61% of brolucizumab patients versus 35% of aflibercept patients at Week 40. In the Phase III Studies RTH258- C001 (HAWK) and RTH258- C002 (HARRIER), brolucizumab demonstrated non-inferiority to aflibercept in mean change in BCVA from baseline to Week 48 in both trials using a non-inferiorit y margin (NIM) of 4 letters. These results were achieved while a majority of patients on brolucizumab 6 mg –56% in HAWK and 51% in HARRI ER –were maintained on a q12w (every 12 weeks) dosing interval following the loading phase (baseline to Week 8) through Week 48. Significantly fewer patients on brolucizumab had disease activity at Week 16 (head -to-head comparison based on a matching dosing regimen) with a relative decrease of 30% (P = 0.0022) versus aflibercept. Significantly fewer patients on brolucizumab had intraretinal fluid (I RF) and/or subretinal fluid (SRF), with a 35% and 33% reduction relative to aflibercept at Week 16 (P < 0.001 for both) in HAWK and HARRI ER, respectivel y, and a 31% and 41% reduction relative to aflibercept at Week 48 in HAWK and HARRIER, respectivel y (P < 0.0001 for both). Brolucizumab 6 mg achieved"
15,page_15,"Novartis Confidential Page 16 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2301 superior reductions in CSFT versus aflibercept in both the head -to-head and maintenance phases (P = 0.0016 and P = 0.0023 at Week 16 and Week 48, respectively , in HAWK; P < 0.0001 at both Week 16 and Week 48 in HARRIER). Brolucizumab safety was comparable to aflibercept, with the overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) balanc ed across all treatment groups in both studies. Since the first marketing authorization approval in Oct-2019 for the treatment of nAMD, adverse events of retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion, that may result in severe vision loss and ty pically in the presence of intraocular inflammation, have been reported from post-marketing experience with brolucizumab (Beovu®). Considering these events, the overall risk/benefit assessment remains positive. Summary Ranibizumab, aflibercept and brolucizumab all inhibit the activity of VEGF -A, with all three having proven efficacy in the treatment of nAMD while both ranibizumab and aflibercept hav e also previously demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of patients with ME secondary to BRVO and CRVO. These findings support the evaluation of brolucizumab in RVO patients. Furthermore, the efficacy profile of brolucizumab in nAMD patients indicates a potential of brolucizumab to differentiate versus existing anti -VEGFs on duration of action and anatomical efficacy in BRVO patients: The longer duration of action is supported by the following outcomes of the Phase I and II nAMD studies with brolucizumab 6 mg dose: Maximum improvements in BCVA and CSFT at Week 4 for ranibizumab versus Week 6 for brolucizumab Greater CSFT stability during q8w maintenance versus aflibercept Fewer rescue treatments versus aflibercept in q8w phase The aforementioned results were confirmed b y the nAMD (HAWK and HARRI ER) 48- week stud y results, which demonstrated: Visual gains at Week 48 achieved with 56% (HAWK) and 51% (HARRIER) of patients treated following a q12w regimen after the loading dose Superior reduction in CSFT versus aflibercept The potential for less frequent injections of brolucizumab as compared to aflibercept Lower proportio n of patients with intra- and/or subretinal fluid Previous studies demonstrating efficacy with anti-VEGFs on BRVO, combined with the evidence detailed above support a loading phase with a q4w (i.e. every 4 weeks) regimen followed by an individualized flexible treatment (IFT) regimen in a maintenance phase based on disease stability for brolucizumab, thus potentially reducing the injection burden. These considerations support the initiation of a Phase III program to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of broluc izumab in the treatment of patients with ME secondary to BRVO with the objective to evaluate the potential to reduce the treatment burden for patients. 1.2 Purpose The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the efficacy and safet y of brolucizumab in the treatment of subjects with ME secondary to BRVO"

Subjects who consent will undergo screening assessments to evaluate their eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment arms: Brolucizumab 6 mg: 6 x q4w followed b y 48 weeks of individualized flexible treatment (IFT) from Week 24 onwards Aflibercept 2 mg: 6 x q4w followed b y 48 weeks of IFT from Week 2 4 onwards Approximately 625 adult subjects will be screened (20% screening failure rate expected) so that approximately 500 subjects (250 per arm, 10% dropout rate expected) will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio in approximately 110 centers worldwide. The maxi mum study duration for 1 subject is 80 weeks, including screening and safet y follow - up. Figure 3-1 Study design *Loading phase; IFT: Individualized flexible treatment Screening period: Day - 28 to Day -1 A screening period of up to 4 weeks will be used to assess subject eligibility . One time reassessment of subjects is allowed, except for the purpose of capturing new BCVA assessments that previously failed to qualify the subject. As long as testing can be repeated within 14 days of the first screening, the other screening assessments do not need to be repeated."

26,page_26,"Novartis Confidential Page 27 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2301 6.3 Subject numbering, treatment assignment, randomization 6.3.1 Subject numbering Each subject is identified in the study by a Subject Number (Subject No.), that is assigned when the subject signs the informed consent form and is retained as the primary identifier for the subject throughout his/her entire participation in the trial. The Subject No. consists of the Center Number (4 digit number for Center No. as assigned by Novartis to the investigative site) with a sequential subject number suffixed to it (3 digit number for Subject No.), so that each subject is numbered uniquely across the entire database. Upon signing the informed consent form, the subject is assigned to the next sequential Subject No. available in the electronic data capture (EDC) s ystem. Subjects who have been screen failures but are rescreened (see Section 8.1) will be assigned a new Subject No. if rescr eening occurs bey ond 14 day s from the original screening date. 6.3.2 Treatment assignment, randomization All screened subjects must be added to the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) sy stem. At the Baseline Visit/Day 1, all eligible subjects will be randomize d via IRT to 1 of the treatment arms, in a ratio of 1:1. The randomization will be stratified by the following demographic groups: Japanese region, Chinese region (including Taiwan and Hong Kong) and rest of world (RoW) region. The unmasked investigator orhis/her delegate will contact the IRT after receiving confirmation from the masked investigator that the subject fulfills all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The IRT will assign a randomization number to the subject, which will be used to link the subje ct to a treatment arm and will specify a unique medication number for the study treatment packages (each containing 1 vial) to be dispensed to the subject. The randomization number will not be communicated to subject or site users. The randomization number s will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from subjects and investigator staff. A subject randomization list will be produced using a validated system that automates the random assignmen t of subject numbers to randomization numbers. These randomization numbers are linked to the different treatment arms, which in turn are linked to medication numbers. A separate medication list will be produced by or under the responsibility of Novartis Global Clinical Supply (GCS) using a validated system that automates the random assignment of medication numbers to packs containing the study treatment. The randomization scheme for subjects will be reviewed and approved by a m ember of the Randomization Of fice. 6.4 Treatment masking The intent of masking is to limit the occurrence of conscious and unconscious bias in the conduct and interpretation of the clinical study . Bias could arise from the influence that the knowledge of a specific treatment assignment may have on the recruitment and allocation of subjects, their subsequent care, the assessment of endpoints, the handling of withdrawals, and so on. The essential aim of masking, therefore, is to prevent identification of the treatments by"
27,page_27,"Novartis Confidential Page 28 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2301 the investigator, subject, and others associated with the conduct of the study until all such opportunities for bias are no longer present. This study will be double -masked, with subjects randomized to be treated with brolucizumab 6 mg or aflibercept 2 mg. The clinical study team will be masked to treatment assignments until Week 52 Database lock andwill be unmasked once theWeek 52 Database lock is reached. However, masking to the original treatment assignment will be maintained at the site level (patients, masked stud y site personnel, masked monitors) until the end of the study. Unmasking of investigators and site personnel directly involved in the conduct of the study will only occur in case of subject emergencies (see Section 6.6.2), and then at the time of the final analysis (see Section 4.4), at the conclusion of the study . In the event of a medical emergency or an adverse event (AE) during the study where the knowledge of subject treatment is required (e.g. in case of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)), an investigator will have the ability to unmask the treatment assignment for a specific subject. The investigator should notify the Sponsor prior to unmasking a subject, if there is suffic ient time. Further, the Sponsor must be informed whenever the randomization code is broken and be informed about the reasons for unmasking. Each site must have both masked and unmasked investigators available. The investigator who performs the injection wi ll be unmasked to the treatments as will any other site personnel who have been delegated responsibility for working with the investigational product. The unmasked site personnel and unmasked injecting investigator must not perform BCVA assessments, comple te ophthalmic examination, disease stability assessments or administer the National Eye Institute Visual Fun ction Questionnaire -25 (NEI VFQ -25). Also, the unmasked site personnel and unmasked injecting physician must not perform assessment of any ocular or non-ocular safet y parameters, or assess causalit y of AEs for subjects during the course of the study. The unmasked investigator/site personnel should, however, assess the subject's functional vision (e.g. finger counting) and may perform other safet y assessments as needed immediatel y following injection. After randomization, the unmasked investigator/site personnel must not change their role to perform a masked role. Only when a masked investigator needs to change to become an unmasked investigator, he/she may change as long as the person is not serving in the Principal Investigator role. This change must be agreed with the Sponsor. Every effort must be made to limit the number of unmasked study personnel to ensure the integrit y of this masked study. Treatm ent masking of individual subjects will remain intact until the database lock has occurred by ensuring that randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of unmasking and will not be accessible by anyone else involved in the study except the unmasked/treatin g investigator. During and after database lock at Week 52 and Week 76, the masked personnel at site and subjects will remain masked to the treatment assignment until the conclusion of the study . Unmasked monitors will be available to perform study medication accountability and to deal with study issues involving the unmasked investigator or unmasked site staff."

The appropriate personnel from the site and Sponsor will assess whether study treatment should be discontinued for an y subject whose treatment code has been broken for any reason. 6.7 Preparation and dispe nsation Each study site will be supplied with study drug in packaging as described under investigational and comparator drugs (Section 6.1.1).For both brolucizumab and aflibercept, the study drug packaging has a 2-part label(base plus tear-off label). A unique medication number is printed on each part of this label, which corresponds to 1 of the treatment arms. Unmasked study personnel will identify the study medication kits to dispense to the subject by contacting the IRT and obtaining the medication number(s). Immediatel y before dispensing the medication kit to the subject, unmasked study personnel will detach the outer part of the label from the packaging and affix it to the source document (Drug Label Form) for that subject's unique subject number. 6.7.1 Handling of study treatment Study treatment must be received by a designated unmasked person at the study site, handled and stored safel y and properly and kept in a secured location to which only the unmasked investigator and designated site personnel have access. Upon receipt, all study treatment must be registered in the IRT sy stem and stored according to the instructions specified on the labels and in the Investigator’s Brochure. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only inaccordance with the protocol. Technical complaints are to be reported to the respective Novartis Country Organization (CO) Quality Assurance. Medication labels will be in the local language and comply with the legal requirements of each country . They will include storage conditions for the study treatment but no information about the subject except for the medication number . The unmasked study personnel must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of study treatment in a drug accountabil ity log. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by unmasked monitors during site visits or remotel y and at the completion of the trial. At the conclusion of the study, and as appropriate during the course of the study, the unmasked study personnel will return all unused study treatment, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug accountability log to the unmasked Novartis monitor or to the Novartis address provided in the investigator folder at each site. 6.7.2 Instruction for prescribi ng and taking study treatment All kits of study treatment assigned by the IRT will be recorded/databased in the I RT s ystem. There will be 2 treatment phases for IVT injections: Loading Phase"
30,page_30,"Novartis Confidential Page 31 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2301 In the loading phase, treatment with either brolucizumab (6 mg) or aflibercept (2 mg) will occur every 4 weeks for six (6) consecutive injections (Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20). Every effort should be made to ensure that the subject adheres to the visit/treatment schedule. Individualized Flexible Treatment (IFT) Phase The IFT phase is defined as follows (see Figure 6- 1): The assessment of disease stability is performed at each visit by the masked investigator as of Week 24, and is guided by the stability of visual acuit y and/or anatom ical parameters (e.g. subretinal fluid, intraretinal fluid, retinal thickness (CSFT) ), within the previous 3 visits. As long as there is no disease stability , subjects will receive active injections every 4 weeks. When disease stability is reached, treatme nt is interrupted. The IRT system will allocate active/sham injections as per the masked investigator’s assessment of disease stability . A disease stability assessment will also be performed at Week 76/EOS visit, however, no stud y treatment will be adminis tered. Brolucizumab or aflibercept (or sham) should be administered in the study eye on the day of the study visit or, if this is not possible, the recommendation is for this to be performed within 3 days after the occurrence of the study visit (except forBaseline/Day 1, in which case study treatment administration should occur within the next 24 hours), or no later than within the visit window as described in Section 3 and Section 8. If assessments and treatments take place on the same day, treatment must occur after completion of the efficacy assessments described in Section 8.3 and pre-injection safet y measures (tonometry , slit lamp and fundus exami nations) described in Section 8.4.3 . If study visit assessments and the corresponding treatment occur on separate days, a repeat safety check -up should be performed prior to treatment of the eye and results documented in the source documents. If any safety concern arises related to the study eye that, in the opinion of the investigator, may be further impacted by the study treatment or injection procedure, treatment needs to be cancelled. Any adverse events must be recorded in the eCRF. The assessment of the masked/evaluating investigator will be passed to the unmasked/treating investigator or delegate in order to be entered in the IRT system and obtain the applicable treatment, active or sham, as assigned b y IRT."
31,page_31,"Novartis Confidential Page 32 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2301 Figure 6-1 Dose and treatment schedule V: Visit; BL: Baseline; IFT: Individualized Flexible Treatment The IVT injection procedure for brolucizumab and aflibercept, including aseptic and antimicrobial requirements, will be performed according to local clinical practice. The sham injection should mimic an IVT injection including the aseptic and antimicrobial requirements. The tip of the sham injection syringe (the hub without a needle) will be placed on the ey e for the approximate amount of time it would take to perform an IVT injection. IVT injection will be performed b y the unmasked investigator. IVT injection is contraindicated in subjects with active ocular or periocular infe ctions and in subjects with active intraocular inflammation (IOI) ; therefore, the investigators must verify that these conditions are not present in the study eye prior to every injection. Ifany signs of intraocular inflammation arepresent, then an IVT injection must notbe performed. Additional ophthalmic examination and imaging should be performed to evaluate IOI (see Section 8.4.3). If IOI is confirmed, s ubjects should be treated for IOI according to clinical practice. From Week 24 to Week 72 inclusive, a sham treatment will be performed to maintain subject masking in case treatment with brolucizumab or aflibercept is not deemed necessary by the investigator. For the sham treatment the tip of an injection syringe (the hub without a needle) will be used."

All data obtained from these assessments must be supported in the subject’s source documentation. Data must be entered as appropriate in the eCRF in a timel y manne r (see Section 11.1 ). A planned study visit schedule will be established at Baseline/Day 1, randomization (first day of treatment), for all subjects. All post-baseline and/or subsequent scheduled visits will be calculated based on the Day 1 visit date. All efforts should be made to adhere to all scheduled visits and assessments as outlined in the assessment schedule ( Table 8-1). A ± 7 day s visit window is allowed (except for Baseline/Day 1), shoul d the subject be unable to return per scheduled visit. All efforts should be made to revert back to the planned visit schedule taking into consideration the restrictions on the minimum treatment interval for the study treatment, i.e. 2 consecutive injections should be spaced b y at least 21 day s. For a given protocol visit (except for Baseline/Day 1), assessments can be performed on 2 consecutive day s in which both day s must occur within the ± 7 day s visit window. Treatment is intended to be administered onthe day of study visit, or if this is not possible, within 3 days after the study visit at which the per-protocol assessments took place (except Baseline/Day 1, in which case study treatment administration should occur within the next 24 hours). For all visits, efficacy assessments (Section 8.3 ) and safet y assessments ( Section 8.4 ) should be performed prior to any administration of study treatment and/or rescue medication. Missed or rescheduled visits should not lead to automatic discontinuation. Subjects who prematurel y discontinue the study for any reason should be scheduled for a visit as soon as possible, at which time all of the assessments listed for the End of Study final visit will be performed. If the COVID -19 pandemic limits or prevents on -site study visits, study treatment could not be administered and other study assessments may not be performed .

For the purpose of screening, fluorescein angiograph y (FA) images from a previous routine evaluation may be used as long as FA was performed within 3 days of the screening visit using Central Reading Center (CRC) -certified equipment and technician/investigator. One time reassessment of subjects is allowed, except for the purpose of capturing new BCVA assessments that previously failed to qualify the subject. As long as testing can be repeated within 14 days of the first screening, the other screening assessments do not need to be repeated. If rescreening is to occur beyond 14 days from the original screening visit date, then the subject must be reconsented and all screening procedures must be repeated. Medical judgment should be exercised to ensure that treatment of BRVO is not withheld in order for a subject to participate in the stud y. 8.1.1 Information to be collected on screening failures Subjects who sign an informed consent form and who are subsequentl y found to be ineligible prior to randomization will be considered a screen failure. The reason for screen failure s hould be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. The demographic information, informed consent, inclusion/exclusion and disposition eCRF pages must also be completed for screen failure subjects. No other data will be entered into the clinical database for subjects who are screen failures, unless the subject experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) during the screening phase (see SAE Section 10.1.2 for reporting details). Adverse events that are not SAEs will be followed by the investigator and collected only in the source data. If the subject is not eligible to be randomized, the IRT must be notified within 2 days of the screen fail that the subject was not randomized. 8.2 Subject demographics/other baseline characteristics Coun try-specific regulations should be considered for the collection of demographic and baseline characteristics in alignment with eCRF.

BCVA measurements will be taken in a sitting position using ETDRS – like visual acuity testing charts at an initial testing distance of 4 meters. The details of the refraction technique and VA testing, as well as training material, are provided in the applic able manual. Certification of the assessment procedures and VA assessors will occur prior to any evaluation of study subjects. 8.3.2 Optical coherence tomography Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) images will be obtained and assessed in the st udy eye at every study visit and in both ey es at screening, Week 24, Week 52 and Week 76/EOS visit. Only SD-OCT machines can be used (e.g. no time domain OCT). These assessments will be performed by a trained technician or investigator at the sites and should be performed after BCVA assessment and prior to any study drug administration.

Clinically relevant findings that are present prior to signing informed consent must be included in the eCRF capturing Medical History. Significant findings identified after providing written informed consent which meet the definition of an Adverse Event must be recorded on the appropriate AE eCRF page. Vital signs Vital signs include assessment of sitting blood pressure (systolic and diastolic pressure in mmHg) and pulse rate (beats per minute) and will be collected at all visits. In case there is an elevated blood pressure measurement as specified in the exclusion criteria, at the screening and baseline visits, the blood pressure measurement should be repeated after 20 minutes. If the repeat measurement is elevated, then the subject is not eligible to be enrolled into the study. On days when study drug is administered, vital signs will be measured before administration ofstudy medication. The results will be recorded in the eCRF. 8.4.1 Laboratory evaluations A central laboratory will be used for anal ysis of all specimens collected at screening, Week 24, Week 52 and Week 76/EOS visit. Details on the collections, shipment of thesamples and reporting of the results by the central laboratory are provided to investigators in the central laboratory manual.

The method used for measuring a subject’s IOP must remain consistent throughout the study . In the fellow ey e, IOP will be assessed at screening, Week 24, Week 52 and Week 76/EOS visit. The values recorded in m mHg for either ey e will be entered into the eCRF. Post-dose I OP should be assessed within 60 minutes after every IVT/sham injection and if, ≥ 25 mmHg, assessment should be repeated until back to normal. Treatment and close monitoring of an elevated IOP sh ould be performed by the investigator according to local clinical practice. Anterior biomicroscopy (slit lamp examination) will be completed at every (scheduled and unscheduled) visit to examine the anterior segment structures ( e.g.eyelids/lashes, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, lens and anterior part of the vitreous) of the study eye (fellow ey e will be examined at screening, Week 24, Week 52 and Week 76/EOS visit and at the discretion of the investigator).

The results of the examination including any abnormalities (e.g. vitreous cells/haze, retinal tear/detachment, hemorrhage and vascular occlusion, vasculitis, etc.) should be recorded in the source documents. If there areany signs of IOI, vitreous cells and haze should be assessed using National Institutes of Health(NIH)grading system ( Nussenblatt et al 1985). The outcome of the examination will be documented in the source document (e.g. ophthalmic examination tool) and appropriate eCRF page as applicable. Pupil dilation for slit lamp and posterior segment examination is optional according to local practice. Clinically significant abnormal findings (as judged by the masked investigator)from slit lamp or posterior segment examinationshould be recorded as an AE in the eCRF. Instruct the patient to contact the site for any changes in vision or any symptoms of inflammation between scheduled visits. Every effort should be made to bring the subject for immediate examination. When IOI, retinal vasculitis, and/or retinal artery occlusion(RAO)is present or suspected during a visit, investigators must perform thorough ophthalmic examination, and will conduct OCT, fluorescein angiography and color fundus photography (preferably wide-field or with peripheral sweeps). These additional assessments will be documented in the source and appropriate eCRF pages as applicable.

A subject will be considered to have compl eted the study when the subject has completed the last visit planned in the protocol. The investigator and/or referring phy sician will recommend the appropriate follow -up medical care, if needed, for all subjects who are prematurely withdrawn from the stud y. 9.1.1 Discontinuation of study treatment Discontinuation of study treatment for a subject occurs when study treatment is stopped earlier than the protocol planned duration, and can be initiated by either the subject or the investigator. The investigator must discontinue study treatment for a given subject if he/she believes that continuation would negatively impact the subject's well -being. Study treatment must be discontinued under the following circumstances: Subject/guardian decision Pregnancy (see Section 8.4.2 and Section 10.1.4 ) Use of prohibited treatment (see Section 6.2.2) Any situation in which continuation with study treatment might result in a s afety risk to the subject Following emergency unmasking (see Section 6.6.2 ) If premature discontinuation of study treatment occurs, the following should be done as appropriate: The investigator must contact the IRT to regis ter the subject’s discontinuation from study treatment."

Where possible, subjects should return for the EOS visit assessments to be performed as scheduled in Table 8-1. If a subject fails to return for study visits without stating an intention to discontinue or withdraw, the investigator must show ""due diligence"" by documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the subject, e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. A subject should not be considered as lost to follow -up until due diligence has been completed (see Section 9.1.3).If the subject cannot or is unwilling to return at an y visit(s), the site st aff should maintain regular telephone contact with the subject, or with a person pre -designated b y the subject. This telephone contact should preferably be done according to the stud y visit schedule. After premature stud y treatment discontinuation, at a mi nimum, in abbreviated visits, the following data should be collected at clinic visits or via telephone/email contact: New/concomitant treatments Adverse events/Serious Adverse Events In the event that premature study treatment discontinuation occurs beca use treatment code has been broken, please refer to Section 6.6.2. 9.1.1.1 Replacement policy Subjects who started treatment but prematurely discontinued treatment and/or study will not be replaced. 9.1.2 Withdrawal of informed consent Subjects may voluntarily withdraw consent to participate in the study for any reason at any time. Withdrawal of consent occurs onl y when a subject: Does not want to participate in the study anymore, and Does not allow further collection of personal data. Inthis situation, the investigator should make a reasonable effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, letter) to understand the primary reason for the subject’s decision to withdraw his/her consent and record this information. Study treatment must be discontinued andno further assessments conducted, and the data that would have been collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing.

All efforts should be made to complete the assessments prior to study withdrawal. A final evaluation at the time of the subject’s study withdrawal should be made as detailed in the assessment table ( Table 8-1). Novartis will continue to keep and use collected study information (including any data resulting from the anal ysis of a subject’s samples until their time of withdrawal) according to applicable law. For US and Japan: All biological samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal may still be used for further testing/analy sis in accordance with the terms of this protocol and of the informed consent form. For EU and RoW: All biological samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal will no longer be used, unless permitted by applicable law.

After stud y completion the subject might receive standard of care if needed. 10 Safety monitoring and reporting 10.1 Definition of adverse events and reporting requirements 10.1.1 Adverse events An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g. any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), sy mptom or disease) in a subject or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study . Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causall y associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product. The investigator has the responsibility for managi ng the safet y of individual subject and identify ing adverse events. Novartis qualified medical personnel will be readily available to advise on trial related medical questions or problems. The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by non -directive qu estioning of the subject at each visit during the study. Adverse events may also be detected when they are volunteered b y the subject during or between visits or through physical examination findings, laboratory test findings, or other assessments. Adverse events must be recorded in the Adverse Events eCRF under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with them, accompanied by the following information (as far as possible) (if the event is serious refer to Section 10.1.2): 1.the severit y grade mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities severe: prevents normal activities 2.itsrelationship to the study treatment or the ocular injection procedure. If the event is due to lack of efficacy or progression of underl ying illness (i.e. progression of the study indication) the assessment of causality will usually be ‘Not suspected’. The rationale for this guidance is that the symptoms of a lack of efficacy or progression of underlying illness are not caused by the trial drug, they happen in spite of its administration and/or both lack of efficacy and progression of underlying disease can only be evaluated meaningfull y by an analysis of treatment arms, not on a single subject 3.its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing, an outcome of not recovered/not resolved must be reported"

All adverse events must be treated appropriatel y. Treatment may include one or more of the following: no action taken (e.g. further observation only ) (investigational) treatment interrupted/withdrawn concomitant medication or non- drug therap y given subject hospitalized/subject's hospitalization prolonged (see Section 10.1.2 for definition of SAE) 6.its outcome: not recovered/not resolved; recovered/resolved; recovered/resolved with sequelae; fatal or unknown. Conditions that were alread y present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in medical history of the subject. Adve rse events (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underly ing signs and s ymptoms. Adverse event monitoring should be continued until 30 days after last administration of study treatment. Once an adverse event is detected, it must be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent (e.g. continuing at the end of the study ), and assessment must be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) o f any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. Information about adverse drug reactions for the investigational drug can be found in the Investigator Brochure (IB). Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria: they induce clinical signs or sy mptoms they are considered clinically significant they require therapy Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results must be identified through a review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non -typical in subjects with the underl ying disease. Investigators have the responsibility for managing the safet y of individual subjects and identifying adverse events. Clinically notable laboratory values are included in Section 16."

Such events should be considered as “medicall y significant”. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse (please refer to the ICH- E2D Guidelines). All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other seriousness criteria are not met . Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also consider ed a serious adverse reaction. All reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered serious adverse event irrespective if a clinical event has occurred. 10.1.3 SAE reporting To ensure subject safet y, every SAE, regardless of causalit y, occurring after the subject has provided informed consent and until 30 daysafter the last study visit must be reported to"

Detailed instructions regarding the submission process and requirements are to be found in the investigator folder provided to each site. All follow -up information for the SAE including information on complications, progression of the initial SAE and recurrent episodes must be reported as follow -up to the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one must be reported separatel y as a new event. If the SAE is not p reviously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study treatment, a Chief Medical Office & Patient Safety (CMO & PS)Department associate may urgentl y require further information from the investigator for health authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same study treatment that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Ad verse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees (EC) in accordance with EU Guidance 2011/C 172/01 or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries. Any SAEs experience d after the 30 day period after the last stud y visit should only be reported to Novartis Safet y if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to study treatment. 10.1.4 Pregnancy reporting To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy occurring after signing the informed consent must be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence (female participants only ). The pregnancy (for female participants) should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. Pregnancy should be recorded and reported by the investigator to the Novartis CMO & PS Department. Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to brolucizumab (investigational) and/or aflibercept, with any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported. 10.1.5 Reporting of study t reatment errors Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration or monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, subject or consumer (EMA definition).

After final database lock, the investigator will receive copies of the subject data for archiving at the investigative site. eSource eSource is a data collection system allowing electronic capture of source data and study data, as required per protocol. eSource is intended to be used for this study . eSource replaces the need"
52,page_52,"Novartis Confidential Page 53 Amended Protocol Version 01 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2301 for using an eCRF. If it is not possible to use eSource for source da ta capture due to exceptional circumstances, data capture and data management will revert to paper and other electronic methods as appropriate. This study will incorporate electronic technology (eSource Direct Data Entry (DDE)) to capture source documents and source data electronically , consistent with final (Center for Drug Evaluation and Research [CDER] 2013) FDA guidance regarding electronic source and regulations related to the maintenance of adequate subject case histories (21 CFR 312.62 [b]). All electronic source documentation and data collected in this study will “meet the same fundamental elements of data quality (e.g. attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, and accurate) that are expected of paper records” into a sy stem that is fully validated and conforms to 21 CFR Part 11 requirements. I nvestigator site staff will not be given access to the sy stem(s) until they have been appropriately trained. Study sites using eSource DDE will be supplied with a tablet personal computer to directl y record subject data and clinical observations on electronic forms with a similar look, feel, and behavior to paper forms. The system will permit the collection of both structured and unstructured information including ad -hoc comments, drawings, and relevant c linical notes the investigative site deems important. Information to be originall y captured and reviewed electronically shall include details of the subject visit and the protocol required assessments performed as a part of these visits, medical history, a nd concomitant medications. Certain data may be captured via other source documentation (such as safety laboratory data report, imaging) and then transcribed, uploaded or transferred into the eSource DDE system. This, and any additional data treated in this manner, will be source data verified by the study field monitor per the monitoring plan and the location of source data (i.e. source, paper or a local electronic system) will be documented prior to study start. The eSource system has the ability to illustrate when a document has been entered from another source. When using an electronic source record as the original point of data capture, there is no additional data entry step for the site for data collected directl y into the application. Rather, the electronic source record directly populates the study database. Automatic validation programs check for data discrepancies and, by generating appropriate error messages, allow the data to be confirmed or corrected before transfer of the data to the vendor wo rking on behalf of Novartis. Remote monitoring of the original electronic source records will take place, however on-site monitoring inspections will continue to take place in order to review data entry of source documentation directly captured on paper and transcribed into the system, to ensure protocol adherence, to assess site operational capabilities, and to perform other monitoring activities that cannot be performed remotely . The investigator must certify that the data entered into eSource are complete and accurate. 11.2 Database management and quality control Novartis personnel will review the data entered by investigative staff for completeness and accuracy . Electronic data queries stating the nature of the problem and requesting clarification will be created for discrepancies and missing values and sent to the investigative site via the"
53,page_53,"Novartis Confidential Page 54 Amended Protocol Version 01 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2301 EDC system. Designated masked investigator site staff are required to respond promptly to queries and to make an y necessary changes to the data. Concomitant treatments and prior medications entered into the database will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Reference List, which employ s the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Medical history /current medical conditions and adverse even ts will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology . Laboratory samples will be processed centrall y and the results will be sent electronicall y to Novartis. Color fundus photographs, fluorescein angiograms, and OCT images will be processed centrally by the Central Reading Center and the results will be sent electronicall y to Novartis. VFQ -25 data will be processed centrally by a designated vendor and the results will be sent electronicall y to Novartis. The data manag ement staff will perform a reconciliation of the data entered on the eCRF versus what is received from the central reading center and central labs. Randomization codes and data about all study treatment (s) dispensed to the subject and all dosage changes will be tracked and managed using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT). The s ystem will be supplied by a vendor who will also manage the database. The IRT data will be sent electronicall y to Novartis. Each occurrence of a code break via I RT will be repo rted to the clinical team and monitor. The code break functionality will remain available until study shut down or upon request of Novartis. The occurrence of relevant protocol deviations will be determined. Once all the necessary actions have been complet ed and the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked and the treatment codes will be unmasked and made available for data analysis.Any changes to the database after that time can onl y be made after written agreement by Nova rtis development management. 11.3 Site monitoring Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit and/or at an investigator’s meeting, a Novartis representative will review the protocol and data capture requirements (i.e. eSource DDE or eCRFs) with the investigators and their staff. During the study , Novartis employ s several methods of ensuring protocol and GCP compliance and the quality /integrity of the sites’ data. The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of subject records, the accuracy of data capture/data entry , the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the"

Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each site’s data may be performed by a c entralized Novartis Clinical Rese arch Associates (CRA) organization. Additionally , a central analy tics organization may analyze data & identify risks & trends for site operational parameters, and provide reports to Novartis clinical teams to assist with trial oversight. The investigator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study , consisting of case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data, retinal images (OCT, CP, FA, wide- field imaging), and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information on eCRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the subject’s file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed b y the subject (a signed cop y is given to the subject). The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their consistency with the data capture and/or data entry . Novartis monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adhe rence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the eCRFs are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the subjects will be disclosed. 12 Data analy sis and statistical methods The database including all Week 52 data will be locked once all subjects have completed the Week 52 visit or terminated the stud y prior to Week 52. Data for the primary endpoint, change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24, will be derived from this database. All subjects still in the study beyond Week 52 will continue to receive masked treatment as scheduled through the planned study duration of 76 weeks. The analysis of the data collected after the Week 52 visit will be performed once all subjects complete the EOS visit or discontinue from the study . Summary statistics will be presented b y treatment group unless otherwise specified. For continuous variables, summary statistics will generall y include: n, mean, standard deviation, median, quartiles, minimum, and maximum. For categorical variables, these will generall y include: n, frequency and percentage in each category . Further techni cal details and discussions of the statistical considerations will be provided in the SAP. Additional analyses may also be conducted to evaluate the impact of theCOVID -19 pandemic. Any data analy sis carried out independently by the investigator should be submitted to Novartis before publication or presentation. 12.1 Analysis sets The All -Enrolled Anal ysis Set includes all subjects who have signed informed consent and are assigned subject numbers. The Randomized Analy sis Set (RAS) consists of all enrolled subjects who are randomized in IRT. Subjects are considered randomized when they have been deemed eligible for"
55,page_55,"Novartis Confidential Page 56 Amended Protocol Version 01 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2301 randomization by the investigator and given a randomization number. Subjects will be analy zed according to the treatment assigned to them at rand omization. The Full Anal ysis Set (FAS) comprises all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 IVT injection of the study treatment. Subjects in the FAS will be analy zed according to the treatment assigned to them at randomization. The Safet y Anal ysis Set (SAF) includes all subjects who receive at least 1 IVT injection of the study treatment. Subjects in the Safet y Set will be analyzed according to the study treatment from which they received the majority of treatments up to and including Week 52. The Per Protocol Set (PPS) is a subset of the FAS and will exclude or censor data from subjects with protocol deviations (PDs) and analysis restrictions (ARs) that are expected to majorl y affect the validity of the assessment of efficacy at Week 24 and/or Week 52 including, for e.g. lack of compliance (including missed treatments and treatment misallocation), missing data, prohibited concomitant medication, and deviations from inclusion/exclusion criteria. Confounded data or discontinuation from study treatment due to lack of efficacy and/or safet y do not constitute, in itself, a reason for exclusion from the PPS. Before the Week 52 database lock the relevant protocol deviations and analy sis restrictions will be identified at the subject level in the database. Censoring applied in relation to the specific PDs/ARs will be specified as well. The FAS will be the analysis set for the primary estimand as defined in Table 12- 1 However, when assessing the robustness of the overall efficacy conclusions, considerations will be given to the analysis based on the primary estimand using FAS and the supplementary estimand (refer toTable 12- 1) using PPS, i.e.similar conclusions on non-inferiorit y based on both estimands are expected. Inconsistencies in the results will be examined and discussed in the Clinical Study Report . 12.2 Subject demographics and other baseline characteristics Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized with descriptive statistics for the FAS b y treatment group and overall. Summary statistics for other anal ysis sets will only be generated if these are anticipated to be different given the subset of the subjects included in the particular analysis set. Relevant medical history and current medical conditions will be tabulated by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term of the MedDRA dictionary for the FAS. Other relevant baseline information will be listed and summarized with descriptive statistics as appropriate. 12.3 Treatments Study treatm ent Descriptive summary statistics for exposure to study treatment will be provided for the SAF, FAS and PPS populations. For the efficacy analysis sets (FAS and PPS), the cumulative number of active and sham IVTinjections will be presented by visit for the period baseline to Week 52/Week 72, including a separate analysis for the loading phases, i.e. up to Week 20 (6 x q4w loading), and maintenance phase (Week 24 to Week 52/Week 72). For the SAF, the summary will include exposure data up to Week 52/Week 72 ."
56,page_56,"Novartis Confidential Page 57 Amended Protocol Version 01 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2301 Prior medication and concomitant therapies The number and percentage of subjects taking prior medication (an y medication taken up to 90 days prior to screening) or concomitant therapies will be summarized by preferred term according to the WHO Drug Refer ence List dictionary using the SAF and FAS (in case there are differences between the two populations). The concomitant therapies (medications and procedures) will include all therapies received after start of study treatment, including those alread y start ed prior to the start of stud y treatment. Further details will be provided in the SAP. 12.4 Analysis of the primary endpoint(s) 12.4.1 Definition of primary endpoint(s) The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24. BCVA will be assessed by the m asked investigator using ETDRS -like charts at an initial distance of 4 meters. The primary anal ysis of the primary endpoint will be based on the FAS. 12.4.2 Statistical model, hypothesis, and method of analy sis The objective related to the primary endpoint is to demonstrate non-inferiority of brolucizumab versus aflibercept with respect to change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24, assuming a non - inferiority margin of 4 ETDRS letters. Let: B = Brolucizumab 6 mg -6 x q4w loading A = Aflibercept 2 mg -6 x q4w loadin g Consider the following non-inferiorit y hypotheses related to a non-inferiority margin of 4 letters: H0: μB– μ A≤ - 4 letters versus H A: μB– μ A> -4 letters where μ Band μ Aare the corresponding unknown true mean changes from baseline in BCVA at Week 24 in the brolucizumab and aflibercept arms, respectivel y. The primary estimand associated with the above hypothesis is defined as the between -treatment difference in change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24, excluding the effect of relevant BRVO prohibited/al ternative medication(s) applied to the study eye (e.g. alternative anti-VEGF treatments for BRVO, laser, intraocular corticosteroids, among others as further detailed in Section 6.2.2 and in the SAP). The anal ysis set for t he primary estimand will be the FAS. Based on the FAS, the above hypotheses will be tested via an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. The model will include treatment, baseline BCVA ( ≤ 34, 34 - 55, ≥ 55 letters) and age category (< 65, ≥ 65) as factors. Additional factors, e.g. ethnicit y, may also be included as appropriate, as well as interactions between treatment and factors of interest. The two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the least square mean difference (brolucizumab -aflibercept) at Week 24 will be presented. Non -inferiorit y will be considered established if the lower limit of the corresponding 95% CI is greater than -4 letters. The same approach for non -"
57,page_57,"Novartis Confidential Page 58 Amended Protocol Version 01 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2301 inferiority assessment in change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24 will be applied to any supplementary estimand. The primary estimand and supplementary estimand of interest are noted in Table 12-1 below together with their key attributes. Sensitivity to the primary estimand will only be explored if the proportion of subjects with missing or censored data is deemed large enough so as to potentially impact the results from the analyses.

LOCF imputation for missing/censored data 1Note that, for all estimands as applicable, all data captured until the start of prohibited medication or alternative medication for ME secondar y to RVO after discontinuation from study treatment will be included in the analysis. 2MMRM: Mixed Model Repeated Measures 12.4.3 Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations As stated in the definition of the primary estimand, missin g BCVA values will be imputed by Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) as the primary approach. For subjects with no post - baseline BCVA value, the baseline value will be carried forward. Data collected after the start of alternative BRVO treatments in th e study eye (e.g. other anti -VEGF treatment, certain laser procedures or intraocular corticosteroids; further details will be discussed in the SAP) will be censored. The LOCF approach is expected to be sensitive to an early study treatment termination/stud y termination due to lack of efficacy , assuming that such lack of efficacy is reflected in the last observed BCVA measurement. In case of the use of alternative treatment for the underly ing disease as described above (BRVO), data collected after the start of such a treatment would be censored. LOCF will then be based on the last value prior to the start of this treatment, again expecting that this value would reflect the negative BCVA outcome under study treatment. In case of missing data due to lack of saf ety/tolerability with impairment of the function of the study eye, the LOCF method would also provide a sensitive approach to capture such an unfavorable outcome. In case of an earl y stud y termination during the loading phase, the LOCF method will result i n a conservative estimate, potentially underestimating the true outcome. LOCF is an established method within the assessment of efficacy of anti-VEGF treatments in terms of BCVA outcome. It is important to note that, in order to facilitate a meaningful treatment effect assessment, non-inferiorit y studies should follow the main design features (primary variables, the dose of the active comparator, eligibility criteria, etc.) as the previously conducted superiority trials in which the active comparator demons trated clinically relevant efficacy . In the aflibercept Phase III studies COPERNI CUS and GALILEO (CRVO) and VIBRANT (BRVO) missing BCVA data was imputed based on LOCF."
