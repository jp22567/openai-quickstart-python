Section 6.1.6: Duration of Therapy; Section 7.1.1: Efficacy Assessments Text was added to clarify that disease progression should be confirmed with a conse cutive assessment if based on M -protein/serum FLC levels. Rationale: To provide additional details and to describe the review process regarding reporting disease progression to the Sponsor. Section 7.1.1: Efficacy Assessments Details on the procedures regarding reporting disease progression to the Sponsor’s Medical Reviewer and the review process by the Medical Reviewer were added. Rationale: To clarify when disease assessments should be performed. Section 7.1.1: Efficacy Assessments; Table 7.1: Disease Assessments (Footnote 1) Added text as shown below: All efficacy laboratory assessments will be collected locally and analyzed centrally unless otherwise indicated in Table 7.1. The disease assessments SPEP, UPEP, and serum calcium corrected for albumin should be collected every cycle for the first 14 months of the study and every other month thereafter. After Cycle 1, IFE should only be done when endogenous M-protein is 0 or nonquantifiable. For subjects who are followed by FLC only, these assess ments are performed every other cycle after 14 months. If the subject does not have documented disease progression as defined in Appendix 2 at the time of study drug discontinuation, then disease assessments must continue to be performed according to the s ame schedule shown in Table 7.2 until disease progression even if a subsequent anti -myeloma treatment is started prior to disease progression. Rationale: Added that local hematology and clinical chemistry tests can be performed earlier (up to 3 days) than the treatment visit AND that they must be evaluated before drug administration. This window offers flexibility to the site so that results can be evaluated in a timely manner before drug administration. Also clarified that for C1D1, these tests do not ha ve to be repeated if performed within 7 days. Section 7.1.2.2: Clinical Laboratory Tests Text added as shown below: Hematology and clinical chemistry tests may be performed up to 3 days before the study treatment administration day. The results from these tests must be evaluated before each study drug administration. At C1D1, these tests do not need to be repeated if they have been performed within 7 days. Rationale: Since Dara SC administration was added, clarification text for evaluations also needed to be added. Section 7.1.4.1: Evaluations; Table 7.2.1; Appendix 9; Appendix 10 Revised the text to refer to the 3 event schedules outlining pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity assessments: (new) Table 7.2.1: Subjects receiving daratumumab via subcutaneous administration, only (new) Appendix 9: Subjects who started daratumumab via IV infusion and switched to daratumumab subcutaneous administration (new) Appendix 10: Subjects receiving daratumumab via intravenous administration, only"

Section 7.1.4.2: Analytical Procedures; Section 7.1.4.4: Immunogenicity Assessments Text added regarding analyzing plasma samples for generation of antibodies to rHuPH20. Rationale: To describe the collection of 2 blood samples, if possible, any time an infusion -related reaction is reported in a subject receiving Dara SC. Section 7.1.4.4: Immunogenicity Assessments The following text was added: In addition, 2 separate blood samples should be obtained, if possible, for the assessment of antibodies to daratumumab and rHuPH20 any time an infusion -related reaction is reported in a subject receiving Dara SC (according to Table 7.2.1 and the laboratory manual) in association with the second administration or beyond. Daratumumab serum concentration will also be determined from the daratumumab infusion reaction sample for the purpose of interpreting immunogenicity data. Rationale: Text added to allow flexibility for the disease evaluation assessments. Section 7.2: Study Schedule Paragraphs added as shown below: At each visit, study assessments should be completed before administration of the study treatment, unless otherwise stated. All visit -specific PRO assessments should be completed before any study procedures for that visit to prevent influencing the subject’s perceptions. Post-baseline disease evaluations may be conducted ± 3 days from the scheduled (based on C 1D1) visit date, if necessary. At the following visit, the subject should return to the original planned schedule. Rationale: To clarify the requirements for tests scheduled during the Screening period. Section 7.2.1: Screening Removed the text that any screening assessment done outside the screening window must be repeated prior to randomization; this provision is provided in the Schedule of Events. Clarified that a laboratory test repeated to satisfy eligibility criteria should be completed within the 2 8- day window from C1D1. The following text was added: Serum M -protein, urine M-protein, and serum FLC baseline disease evaluations must be performed within 14 days before C1D1. It is not mandatory to collect these samples again at the C1D1 visit. Results f rom the skeletal survey or the radiologic assessments for extramedullary plasmacytomas, which have been performed as routine follow -up within 42 days before C1D1, may be used without these tests being repeated . The following text was added: Subjects who ar e screening failures may be rescreened if their condition changes. Rescreening must be discussed and approved by the Sponsor on a case by case basis. Subjects who are determined eligible for rescreening must sign a new ICF."

Section 7.2.2: Treatment Period Added the following text: Subjects should start study treatment within 3 days after randomization. Rationale: To clarify evaluations and assessments in the Schedule of Events. Table 7.2: Schedule of Events Removed Daratumumab pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity timepoints and replaced with references to the appropriate table or appendix for sampling depending on the daratumumab formulation(s) being used. Added the following table notes: ***** For sites where β2-microglobulin is measured locally , the local assessment of serum albumin (instead of the one measured centrally) will be used to determine the ISS stage. ****** Unless otherwise stated, all blood and urine samples must be obtained before administration of study treatment 10 Hematology and clinical chemistry tests may be performed up to 3 days before the study treatment administration day. Laboratory assessments do not need to be repeated if done w ithin 7 days of Cycle 1 Day 1. 11 Disease assessments SPEP, UPEP, and serum calcium corrected for albumin, should be collected every cycle for the first 14 months of the study and every other month thereafter. After Cycle 1, IFE should only be done when en dogenous M -protein is 0 or nonquantifiable. For subjects who are followed by FLC only, these assessments are performed every other cycle after 14 months. 12 Every effort should be made to follow the planned dosing schedule; however, doses within 3 days of the scheduled dose will be permitted. Subjects should start study treatment within 3 days after randomization. The dose does not need to be recalculated for weight changes that are <10% from baseline. 13 EOT visit to occur 4 weeks after the last dose of study treatment or as soon as possible before the start of subsequent therapy. Rationale: Since Dara SC administration was added, a table was created to detail pharmacokinetic / immunogenicity sample collection times for subjects who receive Dara SC .

Section 8.4.3: Events of Special Interest Added the following text: In addition, any events of secondary primary malignancies and suspected transmission of infectious agents will follow the same SAE reporting timelines and procedures outlined in Section 8.4.2 . Rationale: Updated the timing of the IDMC safety review based on the Dara SC group. Section 8.5: Safety Oversight Revised the text as shown below: Safety data will be reviewed by the study IDMC approximately every 6 months (after first randomized subject started Dara SC administration ). Rationale: Since Dara SC administration is now added, biostatistical considerations needed to be revised. Sections 10.3: Analysis Datasets; Section 10.6.1: Enrollment/Randomization/Masking Procedures Statistical text updated throughout to account for SC versus IV administration. Rationale: Information was added regarding source documentation requirements for inclusion/exclusion criteria Section 11: Source Documents and Access to Source Data/Documents Text added as shown below: Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Source Documentation Requirements The minimum source documentation requirements for the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria that specify a need for documented medical history (see Section 5.1 and Section 5.2) are the following: ● Referral letter from treating physician ● Complete history of medical notes at the site ● Discharge summaries Rationale: Updated language on how to quantify the increase in size of lesions based on 2016 IMWG criteria Appendix 2: Modified IMWG Criteria Added text to “Progressive Disease” row as shown below:  Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas (≥50% increase from nadir in SPD7 of >1 lesion, or ≥50% increase in the longest diamet er of a previous lesion >1 cm in the short axis).

PROTOCOL SUMMARY Study Title: A Phase 3 Study Comparing Pomalidomide and Dexamethasone With or Without Daratumumab in Subjects With Relapsed or Refractory Multiple Myeloma Who Have Received at Least One Prior Line of Therapy With Both Lenalidomide and a Proteasome Inhibitor: The APOLLO Study Methods: This is a multicenter, randomized, open -label study. The original design of this study was to treat subjects with daratumumab for intravenous (IV) infusion (Dara IV); however, as of this Amendment 1, all new subjects will be dosed subcutaneously with daratumumab co -formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase rHuPH20 (hereafter referred to as Dara SC). Subjects who already began treatment with Dara IV (ie, prior to Amendment 1) will have the option to swit ch to Dara SC on Day 1 of any cycle starting with Cycle 3 or later. It is to be noted that throughout this document, text has been added to highlight any differences between Dara IV and Dara SC dosing; and where there is no clarification, it is implied tha t the descriptions are the same for both Dara IV and Dara SC. Approximately 302 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either daratumumab + pomalidomide + dexamethasone (DaraPomDex) or pomalidomide + dexamethasone (PomDex). Subjects who alre ady began treatment with Dara IV prior to Amendment 1 will have the option to switch to subcutaneous administration of daratumumab for the remainder of their participation in the study and they will be counted toward the total of 302 subjects. Treatment cy cles have a duration of 28 days. Subjects will receive treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Drug administration and follow -up visits will occur more frequently for early cycles (eg, weekly or bi -weekly). Assessment of myeloma respo nse and disease progression will be conducted in accordance with the modified International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) response criteria. Disease evaluations will occur monthly and consist primarily of measurements of myeloma proteins. Other measures may include bone marrow examinations, skeletal surveys, assessment of extramedullary plasmacytomas, and measurements of serum calcium corrected for albumin. Survival status, subsequent anti -myeloma treatment data, and patient reported outcome (PRO) measures w ill continue to be collected post -treatment. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to compare progression free survival (PFS) between treatment arms. The secondary objectives are the following:  To compare Overall Response Rates (ORR) between treatment arms  To compare Duration of Response (DoR) between treatment arms  To compare time to next therapy between treatment arms"

Common manifestations include bone pain, renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, anemia, and recurrent infections. Based on data from the United States (US) from 2009 -2013, the number of new cases of myeloma was 6.5 per 100,000 men and women per year. The number of deaths was 3.3 per 100,000 men and women per year. In 2013, there were an estimated 95,688 people living with myeloma in the US. Approximately 30,300 people in the US were expected to receive a new diagnosis of MM in 2016 (1. 8% of all new cancer cases) and 12,650 were expected to die from MM ( Howlader et al 2016 ). A hallmark feature of MM is the production of abnormal antibodies or serum monoclonal paraproteins (M-proteins). The M -protein pro duced by the malignant plasma cells is immunoglobulin G (IgG) in about 50% -54% of myeloma patients and immunoglobulin A (IgA) in about 20% of patients. Of those patients producing either IgG or IgA, 40% also have Bence Jones proteinuria, ie, the presence o f free monoclonal kappa (κ) or lambda (λ) light chains in urine. In 15% -20% of patients, plasma cells secrete only light chain protein (light chain myeloma) ( CIBMTR 2013 ). Multiple myeloma is characterized by osteolytic lesions, usually in the pelvis, spine, ribs, and skull. Lesions are caused by expanding plasmacytomas or by cytokines secreted by myeloma cells that activate osteoclasts and suppress osteoblasts. Increased bone loss may also lead to hypercalcemia. Solitary extraosseous plasmacytomas are unusual but may occur in any tissue, especially in the upper respiratory tract. In many patients, renal failure is present at diagnosis or develops during the course of the disorder and is caused by the deposition of light c hains in the distal tubules or by hypercalcemia. Patients also often develop anemia due to kidney disease or suppression of erythropoiesis by cancer cells, but sometimes also due to iron deficiency. These signs and symptoms are commonly denoted as CRAB (Ca lcium elevation, Renal dysfunction, Anemia, Bone destruction). The terms used to define patient populations studied in clinical trials have been standardized based on the American Society of Hematology –Food and Drug Administration (FDA) panel on endpoints in myeloma ( Rajkumar et al 2011 ):  Refractory myeloma: Disease that is nonresponsive while on primary or salvage therapy, or progresses within 60 days of last therapy. Nonresponsive disease is defined as either failure to achieve minimal response (MR) or development of PD while on therapy. o Relapsed and refractory myeloma: Disease that is nonresponsive while on salvage therapy or progresses within 60 days of the last therapy in patients who had achieved MR or better at some point previously before progressing in their disease course. o Primary refractory myeloma: Disease that is nonresponsive in patients who have never achieved a MR or better with any therapy."

Currently approved treatments for patients with relapsed/refractory MM include proteasome inhibitors (PIs) (eg, bortezomib, carfilzomib), immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide, lenalidomide, or pomalidomide), histone deacetylase inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies (elotuzumab, daratumumab) (Ludwig et al 2010 ). However, there is no cure, and current therapies only slow disease progression, prolong survival, and reduce symptoms. Although recent advances in the development of targeted therapeutics and stem cell transplantation have improved overall and event -free survival, the great majority of patients with myeloma will relapse and experience disease progression. 2.1.2 Daratumumab Daratumumab is a human IgGκ monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, which is an important immunotherapy target due to its high expression on malig nant plasma cells and low expression on other normal lymphoid and myeloid cells and is an important modulator of intracellular signaling. The main anti -myeloma effect of daratumumab is attributed to its antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity and compleme nt-dependent cytotoxicity ( Phipps et al 2015 ). An additional mode of action appears to be the induction of apoptosis via Fragment Crystalizable -receptor (FcR) -mediated crosslinking ( Jansen et al 2012 ). Further experiments using a Burkitt’s lymphoma (Daudi) cell line mixed with human macrophages in the presence of daratumumab showed daratumumab -specific antibody -dependent cellular phagocytosis that resulted in a 50% reduction in tumor cell s. Dose - dependent daratumumab -specific phagocytosis was also observed with patient -derived MM cell lines transduced with CD38 ( Overdijk et al 2012 ). Daratumumab has also been demonstrated to have immunomodulatory activity that removes immune suppressive populations of CD38+ MDSC, CD38+ TReg, and CD38+ BReg cells and T cell clonal expansion ( Krejcik et al 2016 ). See the Daratumumab Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for more details. In November 2015, DARZALEX® (daratumumab) was approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of patients with MM who have received at least 3 prior lines of therapy, including a PI and an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD), or who are double refractory to a PI and an IMiD agent. This indication was approved under accelerated approval based on the results of the pivotal, open -label, Phase 2 MMY2002 (SIRIUS) study in which treatment with single -agent daratumumab resulted in an ORR of 29. 2% (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 20.8, 38.9). Median DoR was 7.4 months (95% CI: 5.5, not estimable [NE]). Ninety -five percent (95%) of subjects in the study were double refractory to a PI and IMiD and subjects had received a median of 5 prior lines of th erapy. While 4.7% of subjects discontinued treatment due to adverse events (AEs), none of which were considered drug -related, no subjects discontinued treatment due to infusion -related reactions (IRRs). Stringent complete response (sCR) was reported in 2.8 % of subjects, VGPR in 9.4% of subjects, and partial response (PR) in 17% of subjects. The most common AEs, which occurred in more than 20% percent of subjects, were fatigue, anemia, nausea, thrombocytopenia, back pain, neutropenia, and cough ( Lonial et al 2016 ). These results were supported by those of the Phase 1/2 GEN501 study, which confirmed daratumumab as an effective single -agent treatment option for patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma, especially those wi th disease that is otherwise resistant to other treatments or those who have unacceptable side effects from other treatments. Daratumumab had an acceptable safety profile, with the majority of IRRs Grade 1 or Grade 2 including mild and transient bronchospa sm, headache,"

Most events occurred during the first infusion, and no subject discontinued treatment because of an IRR. Daratumumab demonstrated a 36% ORR in subjects treated with a 1 6 mg/kg dose, with responses improving (or “deepening”) over time ( Lokhorst et al 2015 ). In May 2016, the European Commission granted approval of daratumumab for the monotherapy of adult patients with relapsed and refract ory multiple myeloma, whose prior therapy included a PI and an IMiD and who demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. In July 2016, the FDA granted a Breakthrough Therapy Designation to daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide (an IMiD agen t) and dexamethasone, or bortezomib (a PI) and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy. This second Breakthrough Therapy Designation was granted based on data from 2 Phase 3 studies: MMY3003 and MMY30 04. The MMY3003 (POLLUX) study is a Phase 3, multinational, open -label, randomized, multicenter, active -controlled study of 569 subjects with MM who have received a median of 1 prior line of therapy. Subjects were randomized to receive either daratumumab c ombined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone or lenalidomide and dexamethasone alone. Subjects were treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or if they had other reasons to discontinue the study. The study was unblinded after meeting its pr imary endpoint of improved PFS in a pre -planned interim analysis. In fact, the daratumumab + lenalidomide + dexamethasone combination achieved a 63% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death (PFS) compared with lenalidomide + dexamethasone alon e (Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.37; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.52; p<0.0001). Additionally, daratumumab significantly increased the ORR (93% vs. 76%; p<0.0001) and doubled the rate of CR or better (43% vs. 19%; p<0.0001), as well as the rate of VGPR or better (76% vs. 44%; p< 0.0001). Overall, the safety of the daratumumab combination therapy was consistent with the known safety profile of daratumumab monotherapy and with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone. Daratumumab -associated IRRs (48% of subjects) were mainly Grade 1 or 2 (Gr ade 3 or 4: 5% and 0%, respectively), and most (92%) occurred during the first infusion (Dimopoulus et al 2016 ). Patient reported outcome (PRO) results indicated that, in general, subjects in both groups maintained their HRQoL while remaining on treatment. MMY3004 (CASTOR) is a Phase 3, multinational, open -label, randomized, multicenter, active -controlled study that enrolled 490 subjects with MM who received a median of 2 prior lines of therapy. Thirty -three percent of sub jects were refractory to an IMiD agent and 32% were refractory to their last line of prior therapy. Subjects were randomized to receive either daratumumab combined with subcutaneous (SC) bortezomib and dexamethasone (n=251) or bortezomib and dexamethasone alone (n=247). Subjects were treated with daratumumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The daratumumab + bortezomib + dexamethasone combination demonstrated a 61% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death (PFS) compared with bortezomib + dexamethasone alone (HR=0.39; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.53); p<0.0001). As in the POLLUX study, daratumumab significantly increased the ORR (83% vs. 63 %; p<0.0001) and doubled CR or better rates (19% vs. 9%; p<0.0012), including doubling VGPR rates (59 % vs. 29%; p<0.0001] ( Palumbo et al 2016 ). Patient -reported outcome results indicated that there was no significant detriment to overall HRQoL with the addition of daratumumab to bortezomib and dexamethasone. On 21 Novemb er 2016, the U.S. FDA approved daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, for the treatment of patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy."

For the 103 subjects treated with DPd regimen, the ORR was 59%. Forty -two percent (42%) of sub jects had a response of VGPR or better, 8% of subjects had a stringent CR, and 14% of subjects had CR or better. After a median duration of follow -up of 9.8 months, the median DoR was 13.6 months. At the time of the clinical cutoff, 48% of subjects had exp erienced PFS events; the median PFS was 10.4 months. The median time to progression was 10.9 months. The median OS was not reached, but based on the Kaplan -Meier estimate, the 12 -month OS rate was 72%. (Chari et al 2015 ). Study MMY1004 is an ongoing, open -label, dose -escalation, Phase 1b study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of SC administration of daratumumab. Part 1 is to evaluate the intermediate form of daratumumab SC which is a mix -and-deliver SC presentatio n (Dara MD); Dara IV mixed with rHuPH20 at the study center before administration. Part 2 is to evaluate the final form of daratumumab SC (daratumumab coformulated with rHuPH20) (Dara CF or Dara SC). Preliminary efficacy data suggest that SC administration of Dara MD may enable comparable response rates with Dara IV. Furthermore, to date, the rate of IRRs with SC administration of Dara MD and Dara SC has been lower than the rate reported with Dara IV (see Section 2. 3.1 for details). The SC administration of daratumumab would offer several tangible benefits for both patients and health care providers:  Potential reduction in the incidence rate and severity of IRRs (compared with IV infusion), due to slower absorption of daratumumab into systemic circulation  Shorter administration time (approximately 3 to 5 minutes compared with 4 to 7 hours for IV infusion)  Reduced administration volume (SC administration of approximately 15 mL instead of 500 mL to 1000 mL IV infusion) , which may be clinically meaningful for elderly patients with comorbid cardiac or renal insufficiency Despite substantial progress, myeloma remains an incurable disease plagued by multiple relapses and increasing resistance to therapy. Emerging therapies, however, appear promising and may change the therapeutic landscape in MM. The aim of this study (APOLLO) is to further investigate the efficacy and safety of a DaraPomDex combination in order to provide physicians with a novel therapeutic strategy for tre ating patients with relapsed/refractory MM, as well as to confirm the preliminary data from the MMY1001, single -arm study. On 16 June 2017, DARZALEX® in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients w ith multiple myeloma who have received at least 2 prior therapies including lenalidomide and a PI . However, DaraPomDex is not an approved regimen anywhere in the European Union ( EU). 2.2 RATIONALE Synergistic combinations that target various mechanisms to overcome drug resistance need to be examined in order to realize daratumumab’s full potential. To this end, daratumumab is being investigated as part of multidrug chemotherapy regimens. The cytotoxicity induced by the anti -CD38 antibody, together with the immunomodulatory effects of pomalidomide, could represent an important and effective anti -myeloma combination therapy. Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of combining daratumumab with bortezomib and with lenalidomide. Apart from the daratumumab infusion reactions, which can be minimized with premedication, AEs in these studies were similar to those reported in studies of either bortezomib or lenalidomide alone. Since lenalidomide and pomalidomide are in the same drug class and have a similar"

Pomalidomide is an option for patients who have relapsed/refractory MM and who live in the US, the EU, or elsewhere that pomalidomide has a marketing authorization. The FDA granted accelerated approval for pomalidomide based on a Phase 2 study of subjects with relapsed and refractory disease after at least 2 prior regimens, i ncluding lenalidomide and bortezomib. Subjects received either pomalidomide alone (n=108) or in combination with 40 mg/week dexamethasone (n=113) (Richardson et al 2014 ). With a median follow -up of 14.2 months, median PFS was 4.2 and 2.7 months (HR=0.68; p = 0.003); ORR (≥PR) was 33% vs. 18% (p=.013); median response duration was 8.3 vs. 10.7 months; and median OS was 16.5 vs. 13.6 months, respectively for the pomalidomide + dexamethasone arm compared with the pomalidomide alone arm. The most common hematologic Grade 3 or 4 AEs were neutropenia (41% vs. 48%), anemia (22% vs. 24%), and thrombocytopenia (19% vs. 22%), respectively for the pomalidomide + dexamethasone vs. pomalidomide alone arm. The most common non -hematologic AEs were pneumonia (22% vs. 15%) and fatigue (14% vs. 11%) in the pomalidomide + dexamethasone arm compared with the pomalidomide alone arm, respectively. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted approval for pomalidomide based on a Phase 3 study (MM -003/NIMBUS® study) that evaluated the combination of pomalidomide with low -dose dexamethasone vs. high -dose dexamethasone in subjects with refractory or relapsed and refractory MM. Subjects were randomized to receive pomalidomide plus low -dose dexamethasone (n=302) or high-dose dexamethasone (n=153) ( San Miguel et al 2013 ; Weisel et al 2015 ). Pomalidomide was dosed at 4 mg orally on Days 1 -21 of each 28 -day cycle and dexamethasone was give n at a low dose of 40 mg/day on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 or at a high dose of 40 mg/day on Days 1 -4, 9-12, and 17 -20. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Median PFS with pomalidomide plus low -dose dexamethasone was 4.0 mont hs (95% CI: 3.6, 4.7) vs. 1.9 months (CI: 1.9, 2.2) with high -dose dexamethasone (HR=0.48; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.60; p <0.0001). Median OS was also significantly longer (12.7 months [95% CI: 10.4, 15.5] vs. 8.1 months [CI: 6.9, 10.8]; (HR=0.74 [CI: 0.56, 0.97]; p=0.0285). Overall response rate after a median follow -up of 10 months was 31% in the pomalidomide plus low -dose dexamethasone group vs. 10% in the high -dose dexamethasone group (Odds Ratio [OR] 4.22 [2.35 –7.58]; p <0.0001). In the pomalidomide plus low -dose dexamethasone and high -dose dexamethasone arms, respectively, the most common Grade 3/4 hematological AEs were neutropenia (48% vs. 16%), anemia (33% vs. 37%), and thrombocytopenia (22% vs. 26%). The most common Grade 3/4 non -hematological AEs were pneu monia (13% vs. 8%), bone pain (7% vs. 5%), and fatigue (5% vs 6%). Clinically meaningful improvements in health -related quality -of-life were observed more frequently in subjects receiving pomalidomide plus low -dose dexamethasone than high - dose dexamethason e. A recent Phase 2 study of pomalidomide in combination with low -dose dexamethasone assessed the efficacy and safety in subjects with MM who relapsed after, or were refractory to, a lenalidomide -based, second -line therapy ( Siegel et al 2017 ). A total of 51 subjects were enrolled with a median number of 2 prior lines of therapy. With a median follow -up of 13.6 months, the ORR was 29.4% and median PFS was 13.8 months. Anemia was the most common (25%) Grade 3 or Grade 4 treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs). The most common non -hematological Grade 3 or Grade 4 TEAEs were infections (20%), including pneumonia (10%). Compared with previous studies with the PomDex combination in subjects with re lapsed/refractory MM, this study showed lower rates of hematologic TEAEs and a longer median PFS than previously reported in subjects with more than 1 prior line of therapy (San Miguel et al 2013 ; Richardson et al 2014 )."

This is the approved dose and s chedule of pomalidomide, as well as the same dose and scheduled used in the MMY1001 study. Rationale for Daratumumab Subcutaneous Dose Selection Dara IV infusion requires a large volume (500 mL to 1000 mL) of infusate, resulting in a median infusion time o f 7 hours for the first infusion. Subsequent infusions are approximately 3 to 4 hours. To shorten the infusion time and decrease the risk of IRRs, daratumumab is combined with a technology based on an rHuPH20 to facilitate SC administration. rHuPH20 is the active ingredient of the commercial product Hylenex® recombinant (hyaluronidase human injection), which was approved for use in the US in December 2005. Daratumumab has been administered in combination with rHuPH20 in a Phase 1 study (see Section 2.1.2 ). The maximum trough concentration (C3D1 C trough) was defined as the daratumumab effective concentration based on exposure -ORR analyses from the historical IV monotherapy data. In Study MMY1004, the fixed dose for the SC infusion of 1800 mg was selected from Part 1 of the study based on cumulative review of pharmacokinetics and safety data. Similar or greater maximum trough concentrations (C3D1 C trough) were observed following administration of 1800 mg Dara MD compared to 16 mg/kg IV daratumumab when administered on the same dose schedule ( weekly [QW] for 8 weeks, then every 2 weeks [Q2W] for an additional 16 weeks, then every 4 weeks [Q4W] thereafter) . Preliminary data following administration of 1800 mg Dara CF in Part 2 of the study also supported selection of this dose level, indicating the dose is sufficient to produce a similar or greater maximum trough concentration compared with 16 mg/kg IV. Daratumumab exhibits a wide therapeutic window and there is no apparent rel ationship between drug exposure in the therapeutic dose range and AEs of interest, which also supports the feasibility of utilizing a fixed -dose approach in SC administration. 2.3 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS 2.3.1 Known Potential Risks Daratumumab As of 30 June 2016, 3,147 subjects have been enrolled in studies using daratumumab via intravenous (IV) infusions; 762 subjects received daratumumab alone and 2,385 subjects received daratumumab in combination with other drugs used to treat MM. Given that daratu mumab is not approved in Europe for the indication under study, not all the possible side effects and risks related to daratumumab are known and new side effects may occur. A description of the events observed when daratumumab was given via an IV infusion in combination with other drugs is provided below (see also Daratumumab IB). Daratumumab IV Combination Studies The safety profile of daratumumab in combination with standard background regimens (bortezomib, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, dexamethasone, melphalan, prednisone, thalidomide, carfilzomib) is consistent with those of the background regimens and single -agent daratumumab.

In Part 1 of this study, a mix and -deliver SC presentation (Dara MD) of the currently approved daratumumab IV formulation was used: rHuPH20 and daratumumab were mixed just prior to delivery. Up to 90 mL of Dara MD was administered SC weekly for 8 weeks, every 2 weeks for 16 weeks, and then every 4 weeks thereafter. Subjects in Part 2 of this study receive the final formulation of daratumumab for SC administration in which daratumumab has been co -formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20 [referred to as Dara CF or Dara SC in this protocol]). Dara CF is supplied as a single, pre -mixed vial (120 mg/mL daratumumab containing 30,000 U rHuPH20, 15 mL injection volume for a 1800 mg dose level). It is administered at 1800 mg following the same schedule as Dara MD and c an be administered in 3 to 5 minutes by manual SC injection in the periumbilical area of the abdominal wall. Preliminary data from this study show that SC administration is feasible and has a substantially shortened administration time compared with standa rd IV administration. Fifty -three (53) subjects who received Dara MD (1200 mg [n=8]; 1800 mg [n=45]) between November 2015 and August 2016 were evaluable for safety and efficacy. Treatment -emergent adverse events for Dara MD in this study appeared to be si milar to those reported in single -agent studies of Dara IV ( Lokhorst 2015 , Lonial 2016 . After a median treatment duration of 2.6 months (range 0.7 -12) for the 1200 mg cohort and 3.4 months (range 0.7 -8.6) for the 1800 mg cohort, the key safety findings are as follows: For subjects receiving Dara MD, the incidence of all -grade IRRs was 13% and 24% in the 1200 mg and 1800 mg cohorts, respectively).  IRRs were mostly Grade 1 or 2 and included chills, pyrexia , non -cardiac chest pain, edema of the tongue, nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, wheezing, flushing, hypertension, hypotension, oropharyngeal pain, rash, paresthesia and pruritus. Only 1 subject (in the 1200 mg cohort) developed Grade 3 dyspnea; no Grade 4 IRR wa s reported in either cohort.  All IRRs developed during or within 6 hours of the start of the first Dara MD infusion and were controlled with antihistamine, corticosteroid, or bronchodilator treatment and did not result in treatment discontinuation. No IRRs were reported on subsequent infusions.  The most frequently reported TEAEs (?20% of all subjects) were upper respiratory tract infection (1200 mg: 38%; 1800 mg: 22%), insomnia (1200 mg: 38%; 1800 mg: 11%), decreased appetite (1200 mg: 38%; 1800 mg: 7%), th rombocytopenia (1200 mg: 38%; 1800 mg: 18%), viral upper respiratory tract infection (1200 mg: 25%; 1800 mg: 13%), vomiting (1200 mg: 25%; 1800 mg: 13%), hyperuricaemia (1200 mg: 25%; 1800 mg: 2%), hypokalaemia (1200 mg: 25%; 1800 mg: 4%), blood creatinine increased (1200 mg: 25%; 1800 mg: 4%), anemia (1200 mg: 25%; 1800 mg: 33%), fatigue (1200 mg: 25%; 1800 mg: 20%) pyrexia (1200 mg: 25%; 1800 mg: 27%), diarrhea (1200 mg: 25%; 1800 mg: 22%), headache (1200 mg: 25%; 1800 mg: 18%), cough (1200 mg: 25%; 1800 mg: 13%), epistaxis (1200 mg: 25%; 1800 mg: 4%), hypertension (1200 mg: 25%; 1800 mg: 7%), rhinitis allergic (1200 mg: 25%; 1800 mg: 2%), nasal congestion (1200 mg: 25%; 1800 mg: 2%), rectal hemorrhage (1200 mg: 25%; 1800 mg: 0%), and asthenia (1200 mg: 13 %; 1800 mg: 20%).  Grade 3 or 4 TEAEs were reported in 63% and 49% of subjects in the 1200 mg and 1800 mg cohorts, respectively.

The variability in C3D1 C trough for an1 800 mg Dara SC appeared to be similar to the 16 mg/kg IV dose and the 1800 mg Dara MD dose with a %CV of 46% to 58% across these groups. The C max after the last weekly dose of 1800 mg Dara SC remained within the range observed for the 1800 mg Dara MD and 16 mg/kg IV (C3D1 C max) cohort from Study MMY2002. Study MMY1004 Part 2 also showed that Dara SC ca n be administered by manual injection with a median of 5 minutes (ranging from 2 to 11 minutes) and it is associated with low incidence of IRRs (overall incidence of 8% without Grade 3 or 4 events). The overall safety profile for the Dara SC cohort is simi lar to prior experience with daratumumab IV administration and subcutaneous administration with Dara MD. There are no new safety signals with the Dara SC administration. For further details and the most up to date information about Study MMY1004, refer to the Investigator's Brochure."

Daratumumab has already shown marked activity as a monotherapy in heavily pre -treated patients. Its approval by the FDA in November 2016 when used i n combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, or bortezomib and dexamethasone, highlights the potential clinical benefit of daratumumab as a backbone therapy for the treatment of patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy. The combina tion of daratumumab with pomalidomide, a third -generation IMiD drug, is also likely to provide clinical benefits to patients with relapsed or refractory MM. Several other protein therapeutics are approved for SC administration in combination with rHuPH20. Study MMY1004 provided preliminary efficacy data which suggest that, in this patient population, SC administration of Dara MD ( an “intermediate formulation” that is a solution that requires mixing of the daratumumab drug product with rHuPH20 prior to deliv ery) may enable comparable or better response rates compared with Dara IV. Furthermore, to date, the rate of IRRs with SC administration of Dara MD has been substantially lower than the rate reported with Dara IV. The final SC daratumumab, Dara SC, which w ill be used in Study MMY3013 is a co -formulated drug product intended for a fixed -dose administration, containing rHuPH20 and daratumumab in a single vial and will offer several tangible benefits for both patients and health care providers as described abo ve. 3 OBJECTIVES AND PUR POSE The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the addition of daratumumab to pomalidomide and dexamethasone in subjects with relapsed or refractory MM. 3.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIV E The primary objective of this study is to c ompare PFS between treatment arms. 3.2 SECONDARY OBJECT IVES The secondary objectives of the study are the following:  To compare ORRs between treatment arms.  To compare DoR between treatment arms.  To compare time to next therapy between treatment arms.  To compare OS between treatment arms.  To assess the safety and tolerability of the investigational combination treatment.  To assess the depth of response by analyzing MRD negativity rate for CR or better and for suspected CR/sCR.  To compare health -related qua lity-of-life (HRQoL) and health utility between treatment arms.  To evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of daratumumab on T cells.  To evaluate daratumumab pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity and the immunogenicity of rHuPH20."

The original design of this study was to treat subjects with daratumumab for IV infusion (Dara IV); however, as o f Protocol Amendment 1, all new subjects will now be dosed subcutaneously with daratumumab co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase rHuPH20 (Dara SC). Subjects who already began treatment with Dara IV (ie, prior to Amendment 1) will have the opti on to switch to Dara SC on Day 1 of any cycle starting with Cycle 3 or later. It is to be noted that throughout this document, text was added to highlight any differences between Dara IV and Dara SC dosing; and where there is no clarification, it is implie d that the descriptions are the same for both Dara IV and Dara SC. Approximately 302 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either daratumumab + pomalidomide + dexamethasone (DaraPomDex) or pomalidomide + dexamethasone (PomDex). Subjects who already began treatment with Dara IV prior to Amendment 1 will be allowed to switch to subcutaneous administration of daratumumab on Day 1 of any cycle starting with Cycle 3 or later for the remainder of their participation in the study, and they will be counted toward the total of 302 subjects. Treatment cycles have a duration of 28 days. Pomalidomide will be administered at full dose of 4 mg orally (PO) on Days 1 through 21 of each 28-day cycle. Daratumumab will be given at a dose of 16 mg/kg administer ed as an IV infusion (Dara IV) or 1800 mg subcutaneously (Dara SC) at weekly intervals (QW) for 8 weeks, then every 2 weeks (Q2W) for an additional 16 weeks, then every 4 weeks (Q4W) thereafter. Subjects will receive pre -infusion medications before infusio ns to mitigate potential IRRs. Dexamethasone will be administered according to standard clinical practice and at a recommended total dose of 40 mg weekly for both treatment groups (20 mg weekly for subjects ≥75 years of age). Subjects will receive treatmen t until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Drug administration and follow -up visits will occur more frequently for early cycles (eg, weekly or bi-weekly) (see Table 7.3). Disease evaluations will occur every cycle and consist mainly of measurements of myeloma proteins. Other parameters may include bone marrow examinations, skeletal surveys, assessment of extramedullary plasmacytomas, and measurements of serum calcium corrected for albumin. Patient report ed outcome measures will be administered on Day 1 of each treatment cycle, prior to receiving treatment or any other assessment."

See section below for details. Table 6. 1: Dosing and Administration  Daratumumab Daratumumab will be given at a dose of 16 mg/kg administered as an IV infusion (Dara IV) or 1800 mg subcutaneously (Dara SC) at weekly intervals (QW) for 8 weeks, then every 2 weeks (Q2W) for an additional 16 weeks, then every 4 weeks (Q4W) thereafter. See Section 6.1.5 for guidelines for the IV/SC infusion of daratumumab and Section 7.3.1 for pre -infusion medications and Section 7.3.2 for post-infusion medications to be given to mitigate potential IRRs and the management of these reactions. Subjects should be monitored throughout the infusion and the post -infusion period. See the SmPC for more details about daratumumab.  Pomalidomide The recommended starting dose of pomalidomide is 4 mg once daily taken orally on Days 1 to 21 of repeated 28 -day cycles. Dosing is continued or modified based upon clinical and laboratory findings . Pomalidomide should be taken at the same time each day. The capsules should not be opened, broken, or chewed. This medicinal product should be swallowed whole, preferably with water, with or without food. If the subject forgets to take a dose of pomalido mide on one day, then the subject should take the normal prescribed dose as scheduled on the next day. Subjects should not adjust the dose to make up for a missing dose on previous days."

During the weeks when the subject receives daratumumab, half of the dexamethasone dose (20 mg) will be administered on the day of infusion as the pre -infusion medication (IV preferred, see Section 7.3.1 ) and the remaining dose (20 mg PO) will be self -administered by the subject the following day. This applies only for subjects who are taking the full 40mg dexamethasone dose. The subjects who are taking 20 mg of dexamethasone (≥75 years of age) will receive the entire 20 mg dose as a pre -infusion medication on the day of daratumumab infusion. See the SmP C for more details about dexamethasone. 6.1.5 Dose Adjustments/Modifications/Delays/Infusion -Related Reaction Management  Daratumumab (IV) Infusion reactions may lead to the interruption of daratumumab administration. Pre -infusion medications should be admi nistered prior to treatment to reduce the risk of IRRs (see Section 7.3.1 ). Following dilution, daratumumab infusion should be administered IV at the appropriate initial infusion rate, as presented in the t able below. Incremental escalation of the infusion rate should be considered only if the previous infusion of daratumumab was well tolerated. Table 6. 2: Infusion rates for daratumumab intravenous Dilution volume Initial infusion rate (first hour) Increments of infusion rate Maximum infusion rate First infusion 1,000 mL 50 mL/hour 50 mL/hour every hour 200 mL/hour Second infusiona 500 mL 50 mL/hour 50 mL/hour every hour 200 mL/hour Subsequent infusionsb 500 mL 100 mL/hour 50 mL/hour every hour 200 mL/hour a If the subject’s first infusion of daratumumab is well tolerated (defined as an absence of >Grade 1 infusion -related reactions during the first 3 hours), the second infusion will be administered as indicated in the table above. If the previous infusion rate is not well tolerated, instructions for the first infusion volume and rate will be used for the second infusion. b If the subject’ s first 2 infusions of daratumumab are well tolerated (defined as an absence of >Grade 1 infusion -related reactions during a final infusion rate of ≥100 mL/hour), subsequent infusions will be administered as indicated in the table above . If the previous infusion rate is not well tolerated, instructions for the second infusion rate wi ll be followed.  Infusion -Related Reaction Management for Dara IV Subjects should be observed carefully during daratumumab infusions. Trained study staff at the clinic should be prepared to intervene in case of an infusion reaction, and resources necessary for resuscitation must be available. Attention to staffing should be considered when multiple subjects will be dosed at the same time. For infusion -related reactions of any grade/severity, immediately interrupt the daratumumab infusion and manage symptom s. Management of infusion reactions may further require reduction in the rate of infusion, or treatment discontinuation of daratumumab."

If the subject does not experience any further reaction symptoms, infusion rate escalation may resume at increme nts and intervals as appropriate as outlined in Table 6.2.  Grade 3 (severe): Once reaction symptoms resolve, consider restarting the infusion at no more than half the rate at which the reaction occurred. If the subject does not exp erience additional symptoms, resume infusion rate escalation at increments and intervals as outlined in Table 6.2. Repeat the procedure above in the event of recurrence of Grade 3 symptoms. Permanently discontinue daratumumab upon the third occurrence of a Grade 3 or greater infusion -related reaction.  Grade 4 (life threatening): Permanently discontinue daratumumab treatment.  Daratumumab (SC) Dara -SC will be administered by SC injection at a fixed dose of 1800 mg. Doses will be admin istered by manual push over 3 -5 minutes in the abdominal SC tissue in left/right locations, alternating between individual doses. The volume of the SC solution will be 15 mL for the 1800 mg dose. Refer to the Daratumumab SC Pharmacy Manual for additional g uidance on the administration of Dara -SC. All subjects will be observed for at least 6 hours after the end of the SC injection during Cycle 1 Day 1 and, if deemed necessary by the investigator, after consecutive injections.  Local Injection -Site Reactions In Study MMY1004 Part 1, SC administration of Dara MD in abdominal SC tissue was associated with local injection -site reactions such as induration and erythema in some subjects. The reactions usually resolved within 60 minutes. Injection -site reactions sh ould be managed per institutional standards.  Infusion -Related Reaction Management for Dara SC Subjects should be observed carefully during study drug administrations. Trained study staff at the clinic should be prepared to intervene in case of any IRRs, an d resources necessary for resuscitation (eg, agents such as epinephrine and aerosolized bronchodilator, also medical equipment such as oxygen tanks, tracheostomy equipment, and a defibrillator) must be available at the bedside. If an IRR develops, then da ratumumab administration should be temporarily interrupted. Subjects who experience AEs during daratumumab administration must be treated for their symptoms. Subjects should be treated with acetaminophen, antihistamine, or corticosteroids, as needed. Intra venous saline may be indicated. For bronchospasm, urticaria, or dyspnea, subjects may require antihistamines, oxygen, corticosteroids, or bronchodilators. For hypotension, subjects may require vasopressors. In the event of a life -threatening IRR (which may include pulmonary or cardiac events) or anaphylactic reaction, daratumumab should be discontinued and no additional daratumumab should be administered to the subject. Infusion -related Reactions of Grade 1 or Grade 2 for Dara SC If the investigator assesse s a Grade 1 -2 IRR AE to be related to administration of study drug, then the daratumumab administration should be paused. When the subject's condition is stable, daratumumab administration may be restarted at the investigator's discretion. If the subject experiences a Grade 2 or higher event of laryngeal edema, or a Grade 2 or higher event of bronchospasm that does not respond to systemic therapy and does not resolve within 6 hours from onset, then the subject must be withdrawn from daratumumab treatment."

If the intensity of the AE returns to Grade 3 after restart of the daratumumab administration, then the subject must be withdrawn from daratumumab treatment. For IRR adverse events that are Grade 4, the daratumumab administration must be stopped and the subject withdrawn from daratumumab treatment. Recurrent Infusion -related Reactions for Dara SC If a Grade 3 IRR (or Grade 2 or higher event of laryngeal edema, or a Grade 2 or higher event of bronchospasm) recurs during or within 24 hours after a subsequent daratumumab administration, the daratumumab treatment must be discontinued.  Daratumumab Dose Delays an d Modification Dose modification of Dara IV or Dara SC (increase or decrease) is not permitted. Dose delay is the primary method for managing daratumumab -related toxicities. On the first day of each new treatment cycle and before each dose of study drug, the subject will be evaluated by the treating physician for possible toxicities that may have occurred after the previous dose(s). Toxicities are to be assessed according to National Cancer Institute (NCI) -CTCAE, Version 4.03. Cycle delays will be based on the toxicity experienced during the previous cycle of therapy or newly encountered on Day 1 of a cycle. The study treatment must be withheld if any of the following criteria are met, to allow for recovery from toxicity, regardless of relationship to study drug:  Grade 4 hematologic toxicity, except for Grade 4 lymphopenia  Grade 3 or higher thrombocytopenia  Febrile neutropenia  Neutropenia with infection, of any grade  Grade 3 or higher non -hematologic toxicities with the following exceptions: o Grade 3 nausea that responds to antiemetic treatment within 7 days o Grade 3 vomiting that responds to antiemetic treatment within 7 days o Grade 3 diarrhea that responds to antidiarrheal treatment within 7 days o Grade 3 fatigue that was present at baseline or that lasts for <7 days after the last administration of daratumumab o Grade 3 asthenia that was present at baseline or that lasts for <7 days after the last administration of daratumumab Study treatment should be resumed when the toxicity has resolved to ≤Grade 2. If study drug administration does not commence within the prespecified window of the scheduled administration date ( Table 6.3), then the dose will be considered a missed dose. Administration may resume at the next planned dosing date. A m issed dose will not be made up."

Dose withholdings of more than 28 days for other reasons should be discussed with the Sponsor. If a dose delay occurs, then pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assessments should be performed on the actual day of study drug administration, not on the original scheduled administrati on day. A study drug dose withheld for more than 3 days from the per -protocol administration date for any reason other than toxicities suspected to be related to daratumumab should be brought to the attention of the Sponsor at the earliest possible time. S ubjects missing ≥3 consecutive planned doses of study drug for reasons other than toxicity should be withdrawn from treatment, unless, upon consultation with the Sponsor and the review of safety and efficacy, continuation is agreed upon.  Pomalidomide Doses of pomalidomide may be modified/interrupted following hematologic adverse reactions (neutropenia or thrombocytopenia) and for other Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions judged to be related to the drug. Pomalidomide interruption or discontinuation should be con sidered for Grade 2 -3 skin rash. Pomalidomide must be discontinued for angioedema, Grade 4 rash, exfoliative or bullous rash and for Stevens -Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis related to pomalidomide, and should not be resumed following discontinu ation for these reactions. Interstitial lung disease (ILD) and related events, including cases of pneumonitis, have been observed with pomalidomide. Careful assessment of subjects with an acute onset or unexplained worsening of pulmonary symptoms should be performed to exclude ILD. Pomalidomide should be interrupted pending investigation of these symptoms and if ILD is confirmed, appropriate treatment should be initiated. Pomalidomide should only be resumed after a thorough evaluation of the benefits and th e risks. Based on the pomalidomide SmPC, subjects should be advised to report febrile episodes promptly. Physicians should observe subjects for signs of bleeding including epistaxis , especially with use of concomitant medicinal products known to increase the risk of bleeding. Complete blood counts should be monitored at baseline, weekly for the first 8 weeks and monthly thereafter. A dose modification may be required. Patients may require use of blood product support and/or growth factors. If strong inhibi tors of CYP1A2 (eg. ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, and fluvoxamine) are co -administered with pomalidomide, reduce the dose of pomalidomide by 50%. Instructions for dose interruptions and reductions for pomalidomide related to hematological adverse reactions are outlined in the table below:"

In case of neutropenia, the physician should consider the use of growth factors. For other Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions judged to be related to pomalidomide, stop treatment and restart treatment at 1 mg less than the previous dose when an adverse reaction has resolved to ≤Grade 2 at the physician’s discretion. If adv erse reactions occur after dose reductions to 1 mg, then the medicinal product should be discontinued . Investigators should follow the local label of pomalidomide for the management of interactions with other medical products.  Dexamethasone Instructions for dose modifications of dexamethasone are shown in the table below. Refer to this table for recommended dose reductions, and to the dexamethasone package insert, which states that dosage requirements are variable and must be individualized. Note that thi s table represents suggested dose modifications of dexamethasone, but physician discretion and clinical judgment should prevail."

Dexamethasone dose reduction levels: Dose reduction levels (<75 years of age): Starting dose 40 mg; dose level -1 20 mg; dose level -2 10 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28 - day treatment cycle. Dose reduction levels (≥75 years of age): Starting dose 20 mg; dose level -1 12 mg; dose level -2 8 mg on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28 -day treatment cycle. If recovery from toxicities is prolonged beyond 14 days, then the dose of dexamethasone will be dec reased by one dose level. Investigators should follow the local label of dexamethasone for the management of interactions with other medical products. 6.1.6 Duration of Therapy Treatment with study drug continues until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity (AE related to study drug), or the subject meets other criteria for discontinuation of study drug outlined in Section 5.3. The investigational sites are requested to notify the Sponsor within 1 working day if a subject has been diagnosed with disease progression (that is also confirmed with a consecutive assessment if based on M -protein/serum FLC levels) and provide documentat ion of disease progression. The Sponsor’s medical monitor will review the data provided to confirm that the IMWG criteria for PD have been met (see Section 7.1.1 ). Study treatment discontinuation and start of subsequent anti-myelo ma therapy should occur only after Sponsor confirmation of PD. 6.2 STUDY TREATMENT ACCOUNTABILITY PROCE DURES The investigator, or a pharmacist or other appropriate individual who is designated by the investigator, will maintain accurate records of the prod uct’s delivery to the study site, the inventory at the site, the use by each subject, and the return to the Sponsor or alternative disposition of unused product(s). Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by the field monitor during the study c onduct and a copy of the final drug accountability and reconciliation log will be provided by the investigator(s) at the completion of the study. Daratumumab will be administered by qualified staff and the details of each administration will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF)."

Secondary efficacy endpoints are OS, ORR, DoR, and time to next therapy. Response or disease progression will be assessed by the investigator for treatment decision based on the analysis of serum and urine protein electrophoresis (SP EP and UPEP), serum and urine immunofixation (sIFE and uIFE), serum free light chain protein (sFLC), imaging and bone marrow assessments, per modified IMWG guidelines ( Appendix 2). The statistical analysis will use derived response or disease progression based on a validated computer algorithm that has been shown to provide consistent review of the data necessary to d etermine disease progression and response according to the modified IMWG criteria. All efficacy laboratory assessments will be collected locally and analyzed centrally unless otherwise indicated in Table 7.1 . The disease ass essments SPEP, UPEP, and serum calcium corrected for albumin should be collected every cycle for the first 14 months of the study and every other month thereafter. After Cycle 1, IFE should only be done when endogenous M -protein is 0 or nonquantifiable. Fo r subjects who are followed by FLC only, these assessments are performed every other cycle after 14 months. If the subject does not have documented disease progression as defined in Appendix 2 at the time of study drug discontinuation, then disease assessments must continue to be performed according to the same schedule shown in Table 7. 3 until disease progression even if a subsequent anti - myeloma treatment is started prior to disease progression. The following assessments will be carried out at a central laboratory:  Laboratory analysis for response assessment (SPEP, UPEP, sIFE, uIFE, sFLC)  Minimal Residual Disease analysis for subjects with suspected CR or better performed by next-generation sequencing according to Table 7.1 and the Schedule of Events ( Table 7.3)  Daratumumab -specific Immunofixat ion Electrophoresis (DSIFE) for subjects with IgGk sub-type achieving VGPR or better The following assessments will be carried out at local laboratory, if available, or at the Erasmus laboratory:  Cytogenetics by means of Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) at study entry Disease assessments will be collected locally and analyzed centrally unless otherwise indicated in Table 7.1."

A consecutive assessment can be performed at any time and confirmation should be obtained by M -protein assessments.  Bone marrow assessments do not need to be repeated, but at l east 1 bone marrow assessment is required to substantiate a CR.  If imaging studies were done, they need to rule out new lytic bone lesions.  Should confirmation assessments reveal a better category (eg, VGPR after PR), the response category of the previous assessment will be considered as confirmed (PR).  Should confirmation assessments reveal a worse category, (eg, VGPR after CR), the response category of the subsequent assessment will be considered as confirmed (VGPR).  Should repeated measurements of a vari able result in more values, the worst assessment is to be considered. Laboratory Confirmation of Progressive Disease A diagnosis of PD requires confirmation if determined based on M -protein measurement or serum FLC levels. Confirmation of an increase in M -protein or FLC should be obtained as soon as possible. See Section 7.1.1.3 for information concerning possible false protein electrophoresis (PEP) and immunofixation (IFE) results. Sponsor Confirmati on of Progressive Disease A diagnosis of PD (that is also confirmed with a consecutive assessment if based on M -protein/serum FLC levels) must be reported, via email, to the Sponsor’s Medical Reviewer within 1 working day using the Progressive Disease Noti fication Form together with all supporting documentation for the diagnosis. The Medical Reviewer will check that the investigator’s assessment of PD is consistent with the IMWG criteria and will provide a confirmation on the same form and return it via ema il to the site. In the case that the investigator’s assessment is not deemed consistent with the IMWG criteria, the Medical Reviewer will provide comments in the relevant section of the notification form and may also contact the investigator to discuss the subject further. Study treatment discontinuation and start of subsequent anti -myeloma therapy should occur only after Sponsor confirmation of PD."

Two methods are required:  Protein electrophoresis provides quantitative measurements.  Immunofixation provides qualitative measurements (present/absent). It is a more sensitive method than PEP and is used to con firm the absence of M -protein by PEP (CR).  Serum and urine IFE is required at baseline and to confirm CR regardless of whether measurable M-protein was present at baseline.  Subjects with measurable disease in SPEP will be assessed for response based on SP EP and not by the serum FLC assay.  Subjects with measurable disease in both SPEP and UPEP will be assessed for response based on these 2 tests and not by the serum FLC assay. Blood (serum) and 24 -h urine for M -protein assessment will be collected as indica ted in Table 7.3. Analysis by IFE will be done for all subjects at screening and baseline and thereafter only in subjects at time points in case of disappearance of M -protein by PEP. 7.1.1.2 Free Light Chain (FLC) Pr otein Assessment The serum FLC assay measures free kappa light chain (0.33 -1.94 mg/dL) and free lambda light chain (0.57 -2.63 mg/dL). The FLC ratio is defined as the kappa serum level divided by the lambda serum level. Lambda is the involved light chain if FLC ratio <0.26. Kappa is the involved light chain if FLC ratio is > 1.65. The FLC ratio is considered normal if FLC ratio is within 0.26 -1.65 and Abnormal if FLC ratio is <0.26 or >1.65. FLC serves to monitor disease status when serum M -protein or urine M-protein or both, assessed by PEP, is/are non -measurable (ie, serum M -protein <0.5 g/dL [5 g/L] or urine M -protein <200 mg [0.2 g] per 24 hours) and to identify sCR if CR criteria are met. Blood (serum) for FLC assessment will be collected as indicated in Table 7.3. FLC will be analyzed only when serum M -protein or urine M -protein or both assessed by PEP is/are non -measurable and to identify sCR. 7.1.1.3 Daratumumab -specific Immunofixation Electrophoresis (DSIFE) Daratumumab may be detected on SPEP and sIFE assays used for monitoring disease monoclonal immunoglobulins (M -protein). This can lead to false positive SPEP and sIFE assay results for subjects with IgG kappa myeloma protein and affect assessments of respon ses based on modified IMWG criteria. Therefore, a DSIFE will be performed when daratumumab interference is suspected based on SPEP and sIFE results. This reflex assay relies on the use of a daratumumab -specific murine anti -idiotype antibody that binds and shifts daratumumab’s migration pattern during electrophoresis, thus distinguishing daratumumab from the endogenous myeloma M -protein ( McCudden et al 2015 ). The DSIFE will be"

A portion of screening BM aspirate (first or second pull preferred) is also required for MRD, FISH and Biomarker assessments (central assessments: see Table 7.2 and Sections 7.1.1.7, 7.1.1.9 and 7.1.2.7 for more details). As the procedure is invasive, post -baseline assessments should be performed for confirmation of CR/sCR or, if clinically indicated, at time of suspected disease progression or end of treatment. Plasma Cell Count in Bone Marrow A bone marrow (BM) aspirate/biopsy for plasma cell quantification will be collected at screening and as clinically indicat ed to qualify for CR (see Table 7.3 ) and the percentage of plasma cells will be determined by using cytological/histological examination. In the event a fresh screening biopsy/aspirate cannot be collected, use non -decalcifi ed diagnostic tissue (ie, bone marrow aspirate, touch preparation, or clot selection) or formalin -fixed paraffin embedded [FFPE] block (clot selection only, no bone marrow biopsy) from a sample taken within 42 days from C1D1. Clonal plasma cell will be det ermined by either flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence in order to qualify for sCR (when CR criteria are met and a normal serum FLC ratio is also observed). Either BM aspirate or biopsy can be used for this assessment, but the same method should be used throughout the study. Bone marrow aspirate is required for MRD and flow cytometry assessment."

If presence of a STP is suspected during the study, a computed tomography (CT) or MRI must be performed immediately to confirm and document the lesions’ dimensions.  CT/MRI o Screening: A CT/MRI will be performe d at screening within 28 days prior to start of study treatment. Any imaging assessments already completed during the regular work -up of the subject within 42 days prior to start of treatment can be considered as the baseline assessment. o Post-baseline: A ssessments should be performed using the same imaging technique used at baseline.  If STP is present at baseline, a CT/MRI should be performed every 12 weeks (+/ 7 days) until disappearance of STP or disease progression."

Lesion size will be measured as the sum of the products of the longest diameter and longest perpendicu lar diameter for all measurable lesions. All tumor measurements must be made in millimeters. Measurable disease are lesions that can be accurately measured in 2 dimensions and both diameters must be ≥20 mm when evaluated by standard CT scanning or ≥10 mm w hen evaluated by spiral CT scanning or MRI. At baseline, lesions of smaller dimensions will not be considered measurable and will not be followed for disease evaluation except for assessment of disease progression (when the lesion size increases and become s measurable as per the above guidance). 7.1.1.6 Skeletal Survey A skeletal survey is to be performed by conventional radiography for osteolytic disease within 28 days prior to randomization in all subjects. Results from the skeletal survey which have been performed as routine follow -up within 42 days before C1D1, may be used without these tests being repeated. The survey will be performed during the study if clinically indicated. Use of conventional or low -dose CT scan (ie, of the spine) or MRI is acceptab le. If imaging is performed on treatment for assessment of progression, the same imaging technique as the one used at screening must be used. The number and location of skeletal lesions and whether they are lytic should be recorded on the eCRF. On -treatmen t survey, if clinically indicated, it should be recorded whether there is an increase in the number or size of lytic lesions (as described in Appendix 2). 7.1.1.7 Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Minimal Residual Disease assessment by next -generation sequencing (NGS) is an effective tool in the assessment of patients with MM ( Ladetto et al 2014 ). Several studies have demonstrated that MRD status is correlated with PFS and OS ( Martinez -Lopez et al 2014 ; Kumar et al 2016 ; Munshi et al 2017 ).

Expected progression of disease should not be considered an AE (or SAE). However, if determined by the investigator to be more likely related to the study treatment than the underlying disease, the clinical signs or symptoms of progression and the possibility that the study treatment is enhancing disease progressi on, should be reported per the usual reporting requirements. See Section 8 for details. 7.1.2.2 Clinical Laboratory Tests Laboratory assessments to be performed according to standard clinical practice and medicinal products’ SmPCs are listed below. See Table 7.3 for a schedule of assessments. Hematology and clinical chemistry tests may be performed up to 3 days before the study treatment administration day. The results from these tests must be evaluated before each study drug administration. At C1D1, these tests do not need to be repeated if they have been performed within 7 days.  Hematology panel: hemoglobin; red blood cell (RBC) count; platelet count; white blood cell count with absolute neutrophils and lymphocytes  Clinical chemistry: sodium; potassium; total protein; albumin; calcium and albumin -adjusted calcium; alkaline phosphatase; GT; ALT; AST; total bilirubin; BUN, uric acid; creatinine; glucose; calculated creatinine clearance based (same methodology should be used for individual subject)  Urine or serum pregnancy test in women who can be pregnant  Serum β 2 -microglobulin and LDH (at Screening only)  Blood type, Rh, and Indirect Antiglobulin Test (IAT)"

Subject RBC phenotyping (standard or extended) is an alternative option to the IAT test, if locally required. Either method must be completed prior to first daratumumab infusi on. Daratumumab interferes with the IAT, which is a routine pre -transfusion test performed to identify a patient’s antibodies to minor antigens so that suitable donor blood can be given for transfusion. Daratumumab does not interfere with ABO/RhD typing. C D38 is expressed at very low levels on erythrocytes. Daratumumab binds to the CD38 on erythrocytes, which results in a positive IAT (Indirect Coombs Test). This positive result masks the detection of antibodies to minor antigens and may prevent or delay bl ood banks from issuing donor blood for transfusion. This effect occurs during daratumumab treatment and for up to 6 months after treatment ends. Subjects will receive a patient identification wallet card for the study that includes the blood profile (ABO, Rh, and IAT or phenotyping) determined before the first infusion of daratumumab along with information on the IAT interference for healthcare providers/blood banks. Subjects are to carry this card throughout the treatment period and for at least 6 months a fter treatment ends. Blood banks can eliminate the daratumumab interference with IAT by treating reagent RBCs with dithiothreitol (DTT) (Chapuy et al 201 5; Chapuy et al 201 6). Possible methods for blood banks to provide safe RBCs for transfusion to subjects receiving daratumumab include:  Providing ABO/RhD compatible, phenotypically (standard or extended phenotyping) or genotypically matched units, and  Providing ABO/RhD compatible, K -nega tive units after ruling out or identifying alloantibodies using DTT -treated reagent RBCs. Uncrossmatched, ABO/RhD compatible RBC units should be administered if transfusion is needed emergently as per local blood bank practice. Despite daratumumab binding to CD38 on erythrocytes, no indication of clinically significant hemolysis has been observed in daratumumab studies. For additional details, refer to the Daratumumab IB. In case of an urgent need for a blood transfusion, a blood sample should be obtained before the first infusion of daratumumab and the subject’s blood type (ABO, Rh, and IAT) determined. Subjects should be provided a blood type card, which they will carry with them throughout the treatment period. 7.1.2.3 Vital Signs Vital signs (body temperature, seated blood pressure, and heart rate) will be recorded as outlined in Table 7.3. Blood pressure and heart rate should be measured after the subject has been seated quietly for at least 5 minutes prior to dosing. Subjects receiving Dara IV will have vital signs monitored also prior to, during, and after the infusion period."

A full physical examination will be performed at Screening visit, whereas targeted exams will occur during the treatment and post -treatment periods according to the investigator’s observations and/or subject complaints on new or changed conditions. Significant findings that were present prior to the signing of informed consent must be included in the Medical History eCRF page. Significant new findings that begin or worsen after informed consent must be recorded on the Adverse Event page of the eCRF. 7.1.2.5 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status score will be evaluated as indicated in Table 7.3 using the criteria described in Appendix 3. The assessment should be completed prior to any study -related procedures or assessments. 7.1.2 .6 Cardiac Assessments An ECG will be performed at screening within 28 days of randomization, throughout the study as clinically indicated, and at the EOT visit. 7.1.2.7 Biomarker Assessments Daratumumab functions through multiple immune -mediated mechanisms and these cells may be utilized to examine natural killer (NK) cells or other pertinent immune cells (eg, regulatory T cells, myeloid derived suppressor cells [MDSC], cytotoxic T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages) important for daratumumab res ponse. An evaluation of the immunomodulatory effects of daratumumab on T cells may be performed by molecular and phenotypic studies and comparisons between treatment arms. Bone Marrow Baseline BM aspirate samples may be subjected to DNA and RNA sequencing in order to identify potential neoantigens specific to the subject’s MM cells, T cell receptor repertoire diversity, and may also be used to classify subjects into high -risk molecular subgroups and novel biomarkers of response/resistance to therapy. A BM a spirate will be taken at suspected CR (together with the bone marrow samples for CR/sCR confirmation and MRD assessments) for identification of biomarkers of response to therapy and if feasible at the time of PD for identification of biomarkers of resistan ce to therapy. Whole Blood In addition to planned BM aspirate assessments, whole blood samples will be collected from subjects as outlined in the Schedule of Events ( Table 7.3). These samples may be used to evaluate s pecific subsets of immune cells such as T cell populations (CD4+, CD8+, and activation markers). Cells may also be used for additional phenotypic, molecular, and functional profiling."

In the event the study is terminated early or shows poor clinical efficacy, completion of biomarker assessments is based on justification and intended utility of the data. Samples for biomarker evaluations will be collected as specified in the Schedul e of Events ( Table 7. 3). 7.1.3 Patient Reported Outcome Measures Patient -reported outcome measures will be administered on Day 1 of each treatment cycle prior to receiving treatment or any other assessment. Post-treatment, PRO measures will be administered every 4 weeks for subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression, death, lost to follow -up, or withdrawal of consent. EQ-5D-5L The EQ -5D-5L is a generic measure of health stat us. For purposes of this study, the EQ -5D-5L will be used to generate utility scores for use in cost effectiveness analyses. The EQ -5D-5L is a 5 -item questionnaire that assesses 5 domains, including: mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression plus a visual analog scale rating “health today” with anchors ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state) ( Herdman et al 2011 ). The scores for the 5 separate q uestions are categorical and cannot be analyzed as cardinal numbers. However, the scores for the 5 dimensions are used to compute a single utility score ranging from zero (0.0) to 1 (1.0), with higher values representing better general health status of the individual. Administration time for the EQ -5D-5L is less than 10 minutes. EORTC QLQ -C30 The EORTC QLQ -C30 Item is a cancer -specific PRO measure. It includes 30 items resulting in 5 functional scales (physical functioning, role functioning, emotional funct ioning, cognitive functioning, and social functioning), 1 Global Health Status scale, 3 symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and pain), and 6 single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Scor es are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. A higher score for the global health status scale represents higher quality of life, a higher score for the functional scales represents higher level of functioning, and a higher score for symptom scales/items repres ent higher level of symptomatology/problems. Reliability, validity, and clinically meaningful change of the EORTC QLQ -C30 have been demonstrated in MM patients (Wisloff et al 1996 ; Wisloff & Hjorth 1997 ). The recall period is 1 week (the past week), and the questionnaire takes approximately 15 minutes to complete. EORTC QLQ -MY20 The EORTC QLQ -MY20 Multiple Myeloma Module is an MM PRO measure to be used in conjunction with the EORTC QLQ -C30 fo r assessing HRQoL in patients with MM ( Cocks et al 2007 ). It includes 20 items resulting in 2 symptom scales (disease symptoms and side effects of treatment), 1 function scale (future perspective), and a single item on body image. Items are scored on a 4 -point scale ranging from “not at all” to “very much” and scores are transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. A higher score represents higher level of symptoms, higher functioning, and better body image. The recall period is 1 week (the past week), and the questionnaire takes less than 15 minutes to complete."

For subjects who receive daratumumab by SC administration starting from the first dose, samples to assess the serum concentration (pharmacokinetics) of daratumumab, the generation of antibodies to daratumumab (immunogenicity), and the generation of antibodies to rHuPH20 will be obtained from DaraPomDex subjects according to th e schedule in Table 7.3.1. For subjects who received daratumumab initially by IV then switched to SC after Amendment 1, samples to assess the serum concentration (pharmacokinetics) of daratumumab, the generation of antibodies to daratumumab (immunogenicity), and the generation of an tibodies to rHuPH20 will be obtained from DaraPomDex subjects according to the schedule in Appendix 9. For all subjects, the exact dates and times of b lood sampling must be recorded. Refer to the laboratory manual or equivalent document for sample collection requirements. Collected samples must be stored under the specified and controlled conditions for the temperatures indicated in the laboratory manual . 7.1.4.2 Analytical Procedures Serum samples will be analyzed to determine concentrations of daratumumab or generation of antibodies to daratumumab and plasma samples will be analyzed for generation of antibodies to rHuPH20 using validated immunoassay met hods. 7.1.4.3 Pharmacokinetic Parameters The pharmacokinetic parameters are defined as: Cmax Maximum observed concentration Cmin Minimum observed concentration For daratumumab, the pharmacokinetic evaluations include C min and C max. The C min and C max will b e determined based on collection timepoint. If sufficient data are available, population pharmacokinetic analysis of serum concentration -time data of daratumumab may be performed using nonlinear mixed - effects modeling.

Additionally, blood samples to assess daratumumab and rHuPH20 immunogenicity should also be collected at the final visit for subjects who discontinue treatment. Subjects who discontinue tre atment will also be asked to return for immunogenicity evaluation during the Follow -up Phase. All samples collected for daratumumab immunogenicity analysis will also be evaluated for daratumumab serum concentration to ensure appropriate interpretation of i mmunogenicity data. When both serum daratumumab concentration and daratumumab immunogenicity analyses are specified, they are performed on aliquots from the same blood draw and no additional sampling is required. Procedures for sample collection, preparati on, identification, storage, and shipment will be provided in the laboratory manual or equivalent document. Samples will be screened for antibodies binding to daratumumab or rHuPH20 and serum/plasma titer will also be determined from confirmed positive sam ples. Other immunogenicity analyses (eg, assessment of neutralizing capabilities) may be performed to further characterize the immune responses that are generated. In addition, 2 separate blood samples should be obtained, if possible, for the assessment of antibodies to daratumumab and rHuPH20 any time an infusion -related reaction is reported in a subject receiving Dara SC (according to Table 7.3.1 and the laboratory manual) in association with the second administration or b eyond. Daratumumab serum concentration will also be determined from the daratumumab infusion reaction sample for the purpose of interpreting immunogenicity data. 7.1.4.5 Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Evaluations If sufficient data are available, then other pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling may be performed, including exploring the relationship between serum concentrations of daratumumab and endpoints of clinical efficacy. If these analyses are performed, then the details and results will be presented in a separate report. 7.2 STUDY SCHEDULE Table 7.3 lists all of the assessments and indicates the visits when they are performed. See Section 7.1 for details concerning each assessment. All data obtained from these assessments must be supported in the subject’s source documentation. Baseline is defined as C1D1 after randomization and prior to start of study treatment. For assessments that are not performed on C1D1, the screening results will be considered as baseline. At each visit, study assessments should be completed before administration of the study treatment, unless otherwise stated. All visit -specific PRO assessments should be completed before any study procedures for that visit to prevent influencing the subject’s perceptions. Post-baseline disease evaluations may be conducted ± 3 days from the scheduled (based on C1D1) visit date, if necessary. At the following visit, the subject should return to the or iginal planned schedule."

A subject who has a laboratory result that does not satisfy eligibility criteria may have the test repeat ed when the investigator believes the re -test result is likely to be within the acceptable range to satisfy the entrance criteria, but should be completed within the 28 -day window before C1D1. If the BM sample collected at screening (aspirate) is inadequat e for genetic assessments (FISH) and/or evaluation of percentage of plasma cells, it should be repeated within 28 days of the original collection date prior to randomization. Serum M -protein, urine M -protein, and serum FLC baseline disease evaluations must be performed within 14 days before C1D1. It is not mandatory to collect these samples again at the C1D1 visit. Results from the skeletal survey or the radiologic assessments for extramedullary plasmacytomas, which have been performed as routine follow -up within 42 days before C1D1, may be used without these tests being repeated. Subjects who sign an ICF but who are not randomized for any reason will be considered screening failures. The reason for not being randomized will be entered on the eCRF. The demog raphic information, informed consent, and Inclusion/Exclusion pages must also be completed for screening failure subjects. No other data will be entered into the clinical database unless the subject experienced an SAE during the Screening period. Subjects who are screening failures may be rescreened if their condition changes. Rescreening must be discussed and approved by the Sponsor on a case by case basis. Subjects who are determined eligible for rescreening must sign a new ICF. Subject Demographics and O ther Baseline Characteristics The following data is to be recorded on the eCRF during the screening period:  Demography (date of birth, sex, information on childbearing status of female subjects, race, ethnicity).  Medical history / current medical conditions.  Diagnosis of MM and extent of the disease, including staging at study entry according to the International Staging System (ISS) ( Appendix 1).  Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy for cytogenetics (FISH) at local laboratory, if available, or at the Erasmus laboratory.  All prior anti -neoplastic therapies including surgical interventions and chemo -, biologic -, immunologic - and radiation -therapies and ste m cell transplants provided as treatment for MM.  All concomitant medications and significant non -drug therapies including transfusions of blood products administered within 14 days prior to first dose.  The following assessments must be performed and recorded for all randomized subjects: o Complete physical examination including height and weight. o Vital signs (temperature, heart rate, diastolic and systolic blood pressure). o Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status score. o Electrocardio gram. o FEV1 in subjects with known or suspected COPD."

On daratumumab infusion days, subjects will receive the following medications approximately 1 hour prior to daratumumab infusion:  Dexamethasone 20 mg IV (preferred) or PO (an equivalent of long -acting corticosteroid may substitute [ Appendix 8]);  Paracetamol (acetaminophen) 650 to 1000 mg IV or PO; and  An antihistamine (diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg IV or PO, or equivalent, but avoid IV use of promethazine) ( Appendix 7).  Leukotriene inhibitor (optional) on C1D1: montelukast 10 mg PO. If necessary, oral pre -infusion medications may be administ ered outside of the clinic on the day of the infusion, provided they are taken within 1 to 3 hours prior to the infusion. 7.3.2 Post -infusion Medication in High -Risk Subjects For subjects with a higher risk of respiratory complications (ie, subjects with COPD who have an FEV1 <80% of predicted normal, or subjects with mild asthma [see Appendix 7]), the following post -infusion medications should be considered:  Antihistamine (diphenhydramine or equivalent) on the first and second days after all infusions  Short -acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonist such as salbutamol aerosol  Control medications for lung disease (eg, inhaled corticosteroids ±long -acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonists for subjects with asthma; long -acting bronchodilators such as tiotropium or salmeterol ±inhaled corticosteroids for subjects with COPD) In addition, these at -risk subjects may be hospitalized for monitoring for up to 2 nights after an infusion. If these at -risk subjects are hospitalized, then their FEV1 should be measured before discharge. If these subjects are not hospitalized, then a follow -up telephone call should be made to monitor their condition within 48 hours aft er all infusions. If the subject has not experienced a significant medical event but is hospitalized overnight only for observation, then the hospitalization should not be reported as an SAE. Investigators may prescribe bronchodilators, antihistamines, and corticosteroids that are deemed necessary to provide adequate supportive care in the event a bronchospasm occurs after subjects are released from the hospital/clinic. If an at -risk subject experiences no IRRs, then these post -infusion medications may be w aived after 4 doses at the investigator’s discretion."

Prophylactic administration of levofloxacin (500 mg P.O. daily; dose adjusted for renal function) during the first 3 cycles of treatment is recommended as it has shown to significantly r educe febrile episodes and deaths without increasing healthcare associated infections or carriage of key nosocomial pathogens ( Drayson et. al 2017 ). Prophylaxis for Herpes Zoster Reactivat ion: Prophylaxis for herpes zoster reactivation is recommended during the Treatment Phase. Acceptable antiviral therapy includes acyclovir (eg, 400 mg given orally 3 times a day, or 800 mg given orally 2 times a day or per institutional standards), famcicl ovir (eg, 125 mg given orally, twice a day or per institutional standards), or valacyclovir (eg, 500 mg given orally, twice a day or per institutional standards), initiated within 1 week after the start of study drug. Prevention of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DV T) and Pulmonary Embolism (PE) : Pomalidomide has been associated with an increased incidence of DVT and PE. Therefore, prophylaxis with aspirin or low molecular weight heparin is strongly recommended for all subjects ( Palumbo et al 2008 ). The injection should be handled according to local practice. Bisphosphonate Therapy : For subjects who have not previously received bisphosphonates, bisphosphonates are recommended for all subjects with evidence of lytic destruction of bone or with osteopenia. Bisphosphonate therapy is recommended to be continued per treatment guidelines (NCCN 2014 ; Moreau et al 2013 ). Commercially available IV bisphosphonates (pamidronate and zoledronic acid) are prefe rred, when available, and should be used according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, as described in the prescribing information, for subjects with osteolytic or osteopenic myelomatous bone disease. Oral bisphosphonates may be used as alternatives if IV bisphosphonates are not available at the study site. Investigators should use the same route of bisphosphonate therapy for all subjects at their sites. Therapy for Tumor Lysis Syndrome : Subjects should be monitored for symptoms of tumor lysis syndrome. Management of tumor lysis syndrome, including hydration for abnormal laboratory test results such as hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, and hypocalcemia, is highly recommended. It is also recommended that high -risk subjects, ie, those with a high tumor burden, b e treated prophylactically in accordance with local standards (eg, rehydration; diuretics; allopurinol 300 mg daily and medication to increase urate excretion). 7.3.4 Prohibited Medications, Treatments, and Procedures Concomitant administration of any othe r anti -neoplastic therapy for the intention of treating multiple myeloma is prohibited, including medications that target CD38. Continuation of the study drug and components of the backbone regimens during or after emergency orthopedic surgery or radiother apy because of the subject’s benefit may occur only in the absence of disease progression and after consultation with and approval by the Sponsor. Such emergency radiotherapy may consist of localized radiotherapy for pain control or for stabilization of an extensive bone lesion at high risk of pathologic fracture or damage to surrounding tissues in a subject in whom delay of systemic therapy is not appropriate. Such radiotherapy is to occur within the first 2 cycles of treatment and the absence of evidence of disease progression is to be reviewed and approved by the Sponsor. Concomitant"

Administration of commercially available agents with activity against or under investigation for multiple myeloma, inc luding systemic corticosteroids (>10 mg prednisone per day or equivalent) (other than those given for IRRs as described in Section 7.3) should be avoided. Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory agents should be avoi ded to prevent myeloma -related kidney disease. Typically, IV contrast is NOT used in CT scanning of the subjects with secretory multiple myeloma because of the risk to the kidney. If administration of IV contrast is necessary, then adequate precautions inc luding hydration are indicated. The Sponsor must be notified in advance (or as soon as possible thereafter) of any instances in which prohibited therapies are administered. No interaction studies have been performed with daratumumab. Guidelines for the selection and use of other concomitant medications should be derived from pomalidomide and dexamethasone prescribing information. 7.3.5 Rescue Medications, Treatments, and Procedures See Section 6.1.5 for guidelines for managing IRRs. 7.3.6 Subject Access to Study Treatment at Study Closure Subjects will be provided with study treatment until disease progression, death, lost to follow -up, or withdrawal of consent. The Sponsor may terminate access to study drug if the study is terminated due to safety concerns. At the Sponsor’s discretion, if the decision is made to terminate the study early, subjects who benefit with daratumumab may transition to receive commercially available drug product or daratumu mab from another source. In these circumstances, the Sponsor and investigator will support transition of the subject to ensure that treatment continues and remains uninterrupted. 8 SAFETY MONITORING AND REPORTING 8.1 ADVERSE EVENTS 8.1.1 Definition Accor ding to the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this t reatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medic inal (investigational) product. Pre -existing conditions that worsen during a study are to be reported as AEs. The occurrence of AEs should be sought by non -directive questioning of the subject during screening, after signing the ICF, and at each visit duri ng the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by the subject or through physical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments. Death should not be recorded as an AE or SAE, but as the outcome of an AE. The AE that result ed in death should be reported as an SAE. Expected progression of disease should not be considered an AE (or SAE). However, if determined by the investigator to be more likely related to the study treatment than the"

Laboratory abnormalities that constitute an AE should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Whenever possible, a diagnosis rather than a symptom should be provided (eg, anemia instead of low hemoglobin). Laboratory abnormalities, that do not meet the definition of an AE, should not be reported as AEs. A Grade 3 or 4 event (severe), per CTCAE, doe s not automatically indicate a SAE unless it meets the definition of serious as defined below. 8.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered ""serious"" if, in the view of either the investigator or Spon sor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life fu nctions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient o r subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasi as or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Events not considered as SAEs are hospitalizations for: a standard procedure for therapy administration, routine treatment or monitoring of the study indication, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization for technical/practical or social reasons in absence of an AE, or a procedure which is planned. A prolongation of such a hospitalization for a complication remains a reportable SA E. 8.2 CLASSIFICATION O F AN ADVERSE EVENT 8.2.1 Severity of Event Intensity: all AEs will be graded according to the CTCAE (Version 4.03) as follows (a semi -colon [;] indicates ‘or’ within the description of the grade):  Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.  Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or non -invasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.  Grade 3: Severe or medically signif icant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living.  Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  Grade 5: Death relate d to AE."

The degree of certainty about causality will be graded using the categories below.  Definitely Related – There is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out. The clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, occurs in a plausible time relationship to drug administration and cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) should be clinically plausible. The event must be pharmacological ly or phenomenologically definitive, with use of a satisfactory rechallenge procedure if necessary.  Probably Related – There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship, and the influence of other factors is unlikely. The clinical event, including an abno rmal laboratory test result, occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the drug, is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge). Rechall enge information is not required to fulfill this definition.  Possibly Related – There is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (eg, the event occurred within a reasonable time after administration of the study medication). However, other factors m ay have contributed to the event (eg, the subject’s clinical condition, other concomitant events). Although an AE may be rated only as “possibly related” soon after discovery, it can be flagged as requiring more information and later be upgraded to “probab ly related” or “definitely related,” as appropriate.  Unlikely to be related – A clinical event, including an abnormal laboratory test result, whose temporal relationship to drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable (eg, the event did not o ccur within a reasonable time after administration of the study medication) and in which other drugs or chemicals or underlying disease provide plausible explanations (eg, the subject’s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments).  Not Related – The A E is completely independent of study drug administration, and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related to another etiology. There must be an alternative, definitive etiology documented by the clinician. 8.2.3 Expectedness The Sponsor will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected. An AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the applicable product information (eg, Investigator’s Brochure or SmPC of t he study agents). 8.3 TIME PERIOD AND FREQUENCY FOR EVENT ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW -UP The occurrence of an AE or SAE may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study subject presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor. All AEs, including local and systemic reactions, regardless of seriousness, severity, or presumed relationship to study treatment, will be captured on the eCRF. Information to be collected includes event description, time of onset, cli nician’s assessment of severity, relationship to study product (assessed only by those with the training and authority to make a diagnosis), and time of resolution/stabilization of the event. All AEs occurring while on study must be documented appropriatel y regardless of relationship. All AEs will be followed to adequate resolution."

However, if the study subject’s conditio n deteriorates at any time during the study, it will be recorded as an AE. Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity to be performed. Adverse Events characterized as in termittent require documentation of onset and duration of each episode. The investigator will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is obtained until 30 days after the last day of study treatment. At each s tudy visit, the investigator will inquire about the occurrence of AE/SAEs since the last visit. Events will be followed for outcome information until resolution or stabilization. 8.4 REPORTING PROCED URES 8.4.1 Adverse Event Reporting All identified AEs (related and unrelated) must be recorded and described on the AE page of the eCRF. 8.4.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting Every SAE, regardless of suspected causality, occurring after the subject has provided informed consent and until at least 30 days afte r the subject has stopped study treatment must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of site awareness. Any SAE experienced after this 30 -day period should only be reported to the Sponsor if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to the study treatment. Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be reported as follow -up to the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. Information about all SAEs will be recorded on t he SAE Report Form (in the eCRF). In case of technical difficulties, SAE notification can be carried out by contacting a Pharmacovigilance Officer via email at all_phv@opis.it or by fax using the following number: Fax: +39 0362 633622 (or updated contact information supplied by the Sponsor if the email address and/or fax number change during the conduct of the study). All SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution or until the site investigator deems the event to be chronic or the adherence to be s table. Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested by the study Sponsor and should be provided as soon as possible. The Study Sponsor will be responsible for notifying Health Authorities of any unexpected fatal or life -threatening suspecte d adverse reaction as soon as possible, but in no case later than 7 calendar days after the Sponsor's initial receipt of the information. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries."

Any event that meets the criteria of a serious adverse event should be recorded on the eCRF. In addition, any events of secondary primary malignancies and suspected transmission of infectious agents will follow the same SAE reporting timeli nes and procedures outlined in Section 8.4.2 . 8.4.4 Pregnancy A female subject will be instructed to immediately inform the investigator if she becomes pregnant during the study. The investigator shall report all p regnancies within 24 hours to the Sponsor using the Pregnancy Reporting Form (in the eCRF). In case of technical difficulties, pregnancy notification can be carried out by contacting a Pharmacovigilance Officer via email at all_phv@opis.it or by fax using the following number: Fax: +39 0362 633622 (or updated contact information supplied by the Sponsor if the email address and/or fax number change during the conduct of the study). Any female subject who becomes pregnant during the study must discontinue tr eatment with pomalidomide. The subject should be referred to a physician experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice on her pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. There are no human or animal data to assess the risk of daratumumab use during pregnancy. IgG1 monoclonal antibodies are known to cross the placenta after the first trimester of pregnancy. Therefore, daratumumab should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit of treatment to the woman is considered to outweigh the poten tial risks to the fetus. The investigator will therefore inform the subject of the potential risks to the fetus and discuss with the Sponsor as well as the subject if it is in the subject’s best interest to continue or stop treatment with daratumumab. Moni toring of the subject should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. Pregnancies occurring up to 90 days after the completion of the study medication must also be reported to the investigator. The effect of daratumumab on sperm is unknown. Therefore, p regnancy occurring in the partner of a male subject participating in the study should also be reported to the investigator and the Sponsor. Investigators should comply with the local label for pomalidomide for guidance on subject education and ensure that all subjects adhere to the local Pomalidomide REMS program. When no local pomalidomide REMS program exists, subjects must adhere to the pomalidomide Global Pregnancy Prevention Plan."

A PQC may have a n effect on the safety and efficacy of the product; therefore, the timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analysis of PQC information are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, and the Sponsor. All PQCs must be reported to the Sponsor using a PQC form (in the eCRF) within 24 hours upon awareness, regardless if the relevant defect is combined with an (S)AE or not. Where possible, a sample of the suspected product should be maintained for further investigation if requested by the Sponsor . 8.4.6 Annual Safety Report An annual safety report will be submitted to the Competent Authorities and Ethics Committees once a year, according to the relevant local regulations. 8.5 Safety Oversight Safety data will be reviewed by the study Independent D ata Monitoring Committee (IDMC) approximately every 6 months (after first randomized subject started Dara SC administration). 9 CLINICAL MONITORING Clinical site monitoring will be conducted to ensure that the rights and well -being of human subjects are pr otected, that the reported study data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and that the conduct of the study complies with the currently approved protocol, with GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirements. Monitoring for this study will be performed by a Contract Research Organization (CRO). Details of clinical site monitoring are documented in a Clinical Monitoring Plan (CMP). The CMP describes in detail who will conduct the monitoring, at what frequency monitoring will be done, at what level of detail monitoring will be performed, and the distribution of monitoring reports. Independent audits may be conducted to ensure monitoring practices are performed consistently across all participating sites and that monitors are following the CMP. 10 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS 10.1 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS The primary analysis of PFS will be performed when the targeted number of PFS events required has been reached. Analysis will use response or progression status as derived by a validated com puter algorithm in accordance with modified IMWG response criteria."

The distribution of PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method. The median PFS, along with 95% CIs, will be presented by treatment group. The primary efficacy analysis will be the comparison of the distribution of PFS between the 2 treatment groups using a stratified log -rank test at one -sided 2.5% level of significance, i.e., H0: SDaraPomDex (t) = S PomDex (t) will be tested against the one -sided alternative hypothesis Ha1: SDaraPomDex (t) > S PomDex (t) for all t with strictly inequality for some t. where S DaraPomDex (t) is the survival distribution function of PFS in the DaraPomDe x, and S PomDex (t) is the survival distribution function of PFS in the PomDex arm. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model will be used to estimate the HR of PFS, along with 95% CI (see Section 10.4.2 ). The primary analysis will be performed when at least 188 PFS events have been documented. 10.3 ANALYSIS DATASE TS Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set The intent -to-treat (ITT) Analysis Set comprises all subjects to whom study treatment has been assigned by randomization. Subjects who already began treatment with daratumumab for IV infusion (Dara IV) prior to Amendment 1 approval will be offered the option to switch to SC dosing through study end, and they will be included as part of the ITT population. Safety Set The safety an alysis set consists of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study medication. Subjects who have been randomized and did not take at least 1 dose of study medication will not be included in the safety set. Subjects will be analyzed according to the study treatment they actually received. Pharmacokinetic Analyses Pharmacokinetic analyses will be performed on the pharmacokinetic -evaluable population, defined as subjects who have received 1 dose of daratumumab and have at least 1 postdose pharmacokineti c sample. All serum concentrations below the lowest quantifiable concentration or missing data will be labeled as such in the concentration data presentation. Concentrations below the lowest quantifiable concentration will be treated as zero in the summary statistics. All subjects and samples excluded from the analysis will be clearly documented in the study report. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize daratumumab serum concentrations at each sampling time point and pharmacokinetic parameters of daratumumab such as C min and C max."

If the population pharmacokinetic analysis is conducted, then details will be given in a population pharmacokinetic analysis plan and the results of the analysis will be presented in a separate report. Immunogenicity Analyses The incidence of anti bodies to daratumumab (immunogenicity) and rHuPH20 will be summarized separately for all subjects who receive a dose of daratumumab and have appropriate samples for detection of antibodies to daratumumab and rHuPH20. A listing of any subjects positive for antibodies to daratumumab and rHuPH20 will also be presented. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses If sufficient data are available, then other pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling may be performed, including exploring the relationship between seru m concentrations of daratumumab and endpoints of clinical efficacy. If performed, details and results of the analysis will be presented in a separate report. 10.4 DESCRIPTION OF STATISTICAL METHODS 10.4.1 General Approach All data collected in this study will be listed and summarized as appropriate as described below. Data from all sites will be pooled and summarized. Continuous data will be summarized by mean, standard deviation (SD), median, first and third quartiles, and minimum and maximum. Categorical data will be presented by absolute and relative frequencies (n and %) or contingency tables. One-sided alpha level 0.025 will be used for the primary endpoint, PFS. Hierarchical testing of secondary endpoints will be specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) to strongly control the family -wise Type I error rate at one -sided alpha of 0.025. 10.4.2 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s ) The efficacy analysis will be performed based on the ITT analysis set. Progression Free Survival (PFS) Progres sion free survival is defined as the time, in months, from randomization to the date of the first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever comes first. Clinical deterioration will not be considered progression. For subjects who n either progress nor die, the PFS time will be censored at the date of their last adequate disease assessment. For subjects who start a new anti -MM treatment, PFS time will be censored at the date of last adequate assessment before the start of the new treatment.

The PFS function for each treatment group will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier product -limit method. Median and two -sided CIs for median PFS will be computed by treatment group. Kaplan -Meier plots of PFS will b e presented. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model for PFS with treatment arm as single factor will be used to estimate the HR of DaraPomDex to PomDex and its corresponding 95% CI. The stratification factor will be the same as that used in the randomization process. Absolute frequencies and proportions of subject with disease progression or all -cause death will also be provided. A sensitivity analysis of PFS may be conducted by excluding those subjects who already began treatment with Dara IV pr ior to Amendment 1. 10.4.3 Analysis of the Secondary Endpoint(s) All secondary efficacy analyses will be performed based on the ITT analysis set. Overall Response Rate (ORR) Overall response rate is defined as the proportion of randomized subjects who achi eve a best response of PR or better using modified IMWG criteria ( Appendix 2). Overall response rate will be compared between arms using a stratified Cochran Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) chi -square test with a one -sided α =0.025 level. The response rate, along with its exact two -sided 95% CI, will be computed within each treatment group. A two -sided 95% CI for difference of response rate between the treatment groups will also be computed. A sensitivity analysis of ORR may be conducted by excluding those subjects who already began treatment with Dara IV prior to Amendment 1. Very Good Partial Response (VGPR) or Better Rate, CR or Better Rate, MRD Negativity Rate Very good partial response (VGPR) or better rate is defined as the proportion of randomized subjects who achieve a best response of VGPR or better using modified IMWG criteria. Complete response (CR) or better rate is defined as the proportion of randomiz ed subjects who achieve a best response of CR or better using modified IMWG criteria. Minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate is defined as the proportion of randomized subjects who achieve a negative result of MRD. Subjects without MRD assessment w ill be considered as having MRD -positive results. These categorical endpoints will be analyzed similarly to ORR. Time to Response Time to response is defined for subjects who achieve a confirmed response as the time between the date of randomization and th e first efficacy evaluation that the subject has met all criteria for PR or better. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize time to response."

It is measured from the time, in months, that the criteria for response are first met until the date of a progression event (according to the primary definition of PFS). A subject with response who does not have a progress ion event will be censored at the same time they were censored under the primary definition of PFS. The DoR for each treatment group will be estimated descriptively using the Kaplan -Meier product -limit method. Time to Next Therapy Time to next therapy will be defined as the time, in months, from randomization to the date to next anti - neoplastic therapy or death from any cause, whichever comes first. For subjects who neither start a new anti-neoplastic therapy nor die, survival time will be censored at the d ate of their last available follow - up date. For a randomized subject who does not have any post -baseline follow -up assessments and who has not died, survival time will be censored at the randomization date. Time to next therapy will be analyzed similarly t o PFS. Overall Survival (OS) Overall survival is defined as the time, in months, from randomization to the date of death from any cause. If a subject is not known to have died, survival time will be censored at the date of last contact (“last known date al ive”). Overall survival will be analyzed similarly to PFS. Patient Reported Outcomes Measures EORTC QLQ -C30, EORTC QLQ -MY20 scale and single -item scores, and EQ -5D-5L visual analog scale and utility values will be summarized at each time point. Treatment e ffect will be assessed by change from baseline at each time point summarized by treatment group. 10.4.4 Safety Analyses Safety analyses will be conducted on the safety set and will be reported by actual treatment group. Adverse Events Adverse events will be assessed according to the CTCAE (Version 4.03). The incidence of AEs will be tabulated by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). The incidence of AEs will also be summarized by SOC, PT, an d severity (based on CTCAE grades). The same analysis will be repeated for SAEs regardless of drug relationship, for drug -related SAEs, AEs with CTCAE Grade 3 or 4, and for drug -related AEs. AEs for which relationship to study drug is not specified will be considered treatment -related. Deaths reportable as SAEs will be listed by subject and tabulated by type of AE."

A complete description of subject disposition will be provided, overall and by treatment group specifying the number of randomized subjects, discontinued subjects, and the reason for the discontinuation. The analysis populations will be described and the reasons for excluding the subject from any analysis set will be provided with t he number of protocol violators per each criterion. Medical history data will be presented by MedDRA SOC and PT. 10.4.6 Treatments (Study Treatment, Concomitant Therapies) The Safety set will be used for the following analyses. Investigational Treatment Duration of study treatment, cumulative dose, average daily dose, actual dose intensity, and relative dose intensity of each of the components of study treatment will be summarized by treatment arm and for every 28 -day cycle. The number of subject with dos e changes/interruptions will be presented by treatment group, along with the reasons for the dose change/interruptions. Concomitant Treatments Concomitant medications or procedures and significant non -drug therapies taken concurrently with the study treatm ent will be listed and summarized by World Health Organization (WHO) Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Class, PT, and treatment arm. These summaries will include medications starting on or after the start of study treatment (defined as C1D1) or medicat ions starting prior to the start of study treatment and continuing after the start of study treatment. Any prior medication or significant non -drug therapy starting and ending prior to the start of study treatment will be listed. For the analyses of transfusions, only transfusions received after start of study treatment and up to 30 days after last dose will be considered. The number of subjects with transfusions and number of transfusions per subject will be analyzed. 10.4.7 Planned Interim Analyses An interim analysis will be performed by the IDMC, consisting of 2 clinicians and 1 statistician who are independent experts not otherwise participating in the study, when 113 PFS events arising from both DaraPomDex and PomDex arms, which is 60% of the tot al planned events, have been accumulated. The purpose of this interim analysis is to evaluate cumulative interim safety and efficacy data. The significance level at this interim analysis to establish the superiority of DaraPomDex over PomDex with regard to PFS will be determined based on the observed number of PFS events at the interim analysis, using the O’Brien -Fleming boundaries as implemented by the Lan -DeMets alpha spending method (ie, 0.0038 if observing exactly 113 events). If the stopping boundary i s crossed at the interim analysis, the IDMC may recommend early stopping for superiority, as well as cross -over of subjects who have disease progression on PomDex alone, based on their unblinded review of the efficacy and safety data."

A hierarchical testing procedure will be used. Details about this procedure will be specified i n the SAP for this study. 10.4.10 Exploratory Analyses Additional exploratory analyses will be detailed in the SAP. 10.5 SAMPLE SIZE Based on the primary endpoint PFS, at a one -sided significance level of 0.025, assuming exponential survival distribution w ith a HR of 0.621, a total of 280 evaluable subjects (140 per arm) are required to observe 188 events to test the hypothesis with 90% power. Assuming a 7% rate for permanent early censoring before the study cutoff, approximately 302 subjects will need to b e randomized (151 per arm). The primary analysis of PFS will occur after approximately 188 PFS events have been observed. The actual timing of the analysis will depend on the event rates in both control and treatment arms and will be monitored during the study. Long -term survival follow -up will continue until 166 deaths have been observed. Therefore, this study will achieve approximately 70% power to detect a 34% reduction in the risk of death (HR=0.66) with a log -rank test (one -sided alpha=0.025). 10.6 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE B IAS 10.6.1 Enrollment/ Randomization/ Masking Procedures Subject Numbering Each subject is identified in the study by a Subject Number (Subject No.), that is assigned when the subject is first enrolled for screening and is retained as the primary identifier for the subject throughout his/her entire participation in the study. The investigator or designated staff will contact the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) and provide the requested information for the subject to register them into the system. Once assigned, the Subject No. must not be reused for any other subject and the Subject No. for that individual must not be changed. If the subject fails to be randomized for any reason, then the reason will be entered into the Screening Disposition page. Treatment Assignment/Randomization Subjects will be assigned to 1 of the treatments (ie, DaraPomDex vs. PomDex) in a 1:1 ratio stratified by number of lines of prior therapy (1 vs. 2 -3 vs. ≥4) and ISS stage (1, 2, 3). Subjects who already began treatment with daratumumab for IV infusion (Dara IV) prior to Amendment 1 approval will be offered the option to switch to SC dosing through study end, and they will be counted toward a total of 302 subjects."

A subject randomization list will be produced by the IWRS provider using a validated system that automates the random assignment of subject numbers to randomization numbers. These randomization numbers are linked to the different treatment arms, which in turn are linked to medication numbers. Prior to dosing, all subject who fulfill all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized via IWRS to 1 of the treatment arms. The investigator or his/her delegate will log on to the IWRS and confirm that the subject fulfills all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The IWRS will assign a randomization number to the subject, which will be used to link the subject to a treatment arm and will specify a unique medication number for the first package of study treatment to be dispensed to the subject. 10.6.2 Blinding - Unblinding Since this is an open -label study, the treatment will be open to subject, investigator staff, and personnel performing the assessments. 11 SOURCE DOCUMENTS AND ACCESS TO SOURCE DATA/DOCUMENTS Each participating site will maintain appropriate medical and research records for this study, in compliance with ICH E6 and regulatory and institutional requirements for the protection o f confidentiality of subject.

Designated investigator site staff will not be given access to the Electronic Data Capture system until they are trained. Web -based software will be used and no installation procedure is needed. Each site will be authorized by the administrator to access the eCRF. Each site -quali fied personnel will be allowed to access the eCRF by means of a ‘login mask’ requiring user ID and password and may read, modify, and update only the information he/she previously reported. Each page reports site code and subject code. On-line validation p rograms will check for data discrepancies and, by generating appropriate error messages, allow the data to be confirmed or corrected before transfer to the CRO working on behalf of the Sponsor. The investigator will certify that the data entered into the e CRF is complete and accurate. After database lock, the investigator will receive a CD -ROM of subject data for archiving at the investigational site. Database Management and Quality Control The CRO working on behalf of the Sponsor will review the data enter ed into the eCRF by investigational staff for completeness and accuracy and instruct site personnel to make any necessary corrections or additions. The Data Manager will perform the cleaning session by reviewing the warning messages raised by on -line check s and by running post -entry checks by means of validation programs and data listings specific for the study. If clarifications are needed, the Data Manager will raise queries by means of data query forms through the web application. Designated investigator site staff will be required to respond to queries and the Data Manager will make the correction to the database according to the responses. Data collection and query flows, as well as the on -line and off -line checks, are detailed in the Data Management Pl an and Data Validation documents. Concomitant medications and prior medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug Reference List, which employs the ATC classification system. Medical history/current medical conditions and AEs will be coded using MedDRA. Randomization codes and data about the study drug are tracked using the eCRF. The system is supplied by CRO, who also manages the database. The occurrence of any protocol deviations will be checked and the database will be locked and made available for data analysis after these actions have been completed and the database has been declared complete and accurate."

All deviations must be addressed in study source documents. 14.4 PUBLICATION AND DATA SHARING POLICY This study will ensure that the public has access to the published results of the research. The International Committee of Medical Jour nal Editors (ICMJE) member journals have adopted a clinical trials registration policy as a condition for publication. The ICMJE defines a clinical trial as any research project that prospectively assigns human subjects to intervention or concurrent compar ison or control groups to study the cause -and-effect relationship between a medical intervention and a health outcome. Medical interventions include drugs, surgical procedures, devices, behavioral treatments, process -of-care changes, and the like. Health o utcomes include any biomedical or health -related measures obtained in patients or subjects, including pharmacokinetic measures and AEs. The ICMJE policy requires that all clinical trials be registered in a public trials registry such as ClinicalTrials.gov, which is sponsored by the National Library of Medicine. Other biomedical journals are considering adopting similar policies."

If serum and urine M -protein are unmeasurable, 3 a >50% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M -protein criteria. If serum and urine M -protein are not measurable, and serum free light assay is also not measureable, >50% reduction in plasma cells is required in place of M-protein, provided baseline bone marrow plasma cell percentage was >30%. In addition to the above listed criteria, if present at baseline, a >50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required. Minor (Minimal) Response (MR) 25-49% reduction of serum M -protein and reduction in 24 -hour urine M -protein by 50 -89%, which still exceeds 200 mg per 24 hours. In addition, if present at baseline, 25 -49% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required. No increase in the size or number of lytic bone lesions (development of compression fracture does n ot exclude response). No change/Stable disease Not meeting criteria for CR, VGPR, PR, or progressive disease. Progressive disease (PD)3 Any of the following:  Increase of >25% from lowest response value in any one or more of the following: o Serum M -component and/or (the absolute increase must be >0.5 g/dL)4 o Urine M -component and/or (the absolute increase must be >200 mg/24 h) o Only in patients without measurable serum and urine M -protein levels; the difference between involved and uninvolved F LC levels. The absolute increase must be >10 mg/dL o Bone marrow plasma cell percentage; the absolute percentage must be >10%5  Definite development of new bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas or definite increase in the size of existing bone lesions or soft tissue plasmacytomas (≥50% increase from nadir in SPD7 of >1 lesion, or ≥50% increase in the longest diameter of a previous lesion >1 cm in the short axis).  Development of hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium >11.5 mg/dL or 2.87 mmol/L) that can be attributed solely to the plasma cell proliferative disorder"

A definite increase is defined as a 50% (and at least 1 cm) increase as measured serially by the sum of the products of the cross -diameters of the measurable lesion  Hypercalcemia (>11.5 mg/dL) [2.87 mmol/L]  Decrease in hemoglobin of >2 g/dL [1.24 mmol/L]  Rise in serum creatinine by 2 mg/dL or more [177 mol/L or more] Relapse from CR3 (To be used only if the end point studied is DFS)6 Any one or more of the following:  Reappearance of serum or urine M -protein by immunofixation or electrophoresis  Development of >5% plasma cells in the bone marrow5  Appearance of any other sign of progression (i.e., new plasmacytoma, lytic bone lesion, or hypercalcemia) Note: A clarification to IMWG criteria for coding CR and VGPR in patients in whom the only measurable disease is by serum FLC levels: CR in such patients is defined as a normal FLC ratio of 0.26–1.65 in addition to CR criteria listed above. VGPR in such patients is defined as a >90% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved free light chain (FLC) levels. 1 Confirmation with repeat bone marrow biopsy not needed. 2 Presence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the kappa/lambda ratio. An abnormal kappa/lambda ratio by immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence requires a minimu m of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An abnormal ratio reflecting presence of an abnormal clone is kappa/lambda of > 4:1 or < 1:2. 3 All relapse categories require 2 consecutive assessments made at any time before classification as relapse or disease progre ssion and/or the institution of any new therapy. In the IMWG criteria, CR patients must also meet the criteria for PD shown here to be classified as progressive disease for the purposes of calculating time to progression and PFS. The definitions of relapse , clinical relapse and relapse from CR are not to be used in calculation of time to progression or PFS. 4 For progressive disease, serum M -component increases of ≥1 g /dL are sufficient to define relapse if starting M -component is ≥5 g/dL. 5 Relapse from CR has the 5% cutoff versus 10% for other categories of relapse. 6 For purposes of calculating time to progression and PFS, CR patients should also be evaluated using criteria listed above for progressive disease. 7 SPD = sum of the products of the maximal p erpendicular diameters of measured lesions"
