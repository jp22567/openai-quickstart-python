Background 1.1 Renal C ell Carcinoma 1.1.1 Epidemiology Kidney cancer accounts for approximately 2 -3% of adult malignancies with 337860 new cases and 143406 deaths worldwide [1] . The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be 62700 new cases (39650 in males, 23050 in females) of malignant tumors of the kidney, with 14240 deaths ( 9240 in males, 5000 in females) in United States in 201 6. The most common type of kidney cancer - renal cell carcinoma (RCC) – is expected to account for 80- 90% of this incidence and mortality [2]. RCC is more common in populations of Northern Europe and North America than in those of other parts of the world. It is diagnosed more often in men than in women (1,6:1) and with blacks than in whites in United States . The patient’s median age at the time of diagnosis was 64 years, according to a 4-year observation (2010-2014) [3]. Newly diagnosed patients with a metastatic disease (stage IV, according to TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors ) accounted for 16% during the period of 2007- 2013. The 5 -year survival rate in that group was 11.7 % [3]. 1.1.2 The R ole of VHL -HIF A xis in the P athogenesis of RCC The most frequent histological subtypes of RCC include clear -cell RCC (ccRCC), papillary RCC (pRCC), and chromophobe RCC (crRCC) that together represent more than 90% of all RCCs [4]. The knowledge of the genetic basis of RCC starts more than 100 years ago with reports of Collins, von Hippel and Lindau, who observed vascular -appearing growths involving the retina and occurring in a familial context [5 -7]. The disease the researchers referred to was an autosomal -dominant dominant condition predisposing carriers to the development of hemangioblastomas, pheochromocytomas as well as RCCs, named further the von Hippel -Lindau disease (vHL). The sequencing of human von Hippel-Lindau gene ( VHL) in 1993 was a mile -step in understanding the molecular basis of RCC [8]. Its germline inactivating mutation causes vHL disease [9]. The gene, mapped to 3p25, contains three exons and encodes 2 proteins by virtue of 2 alternative, start codons. Both forms are referred to as “pVHL” because they behave similarly in biochemical and biological aspects, as well as VHL mutations in RCC affect both pVHL isoforms [10]. pVHL is the substrate recognition component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that facilitates the oxygen -dependent ubiquitnation of the hypoxia -inducible factors (HIFs). HIF is a heterodimeric DNA-binding transcription factor consisting of an unstable α subunit and a stable β subunit. It regulates the expression of more than 1,000 target genes through binding to hypoxia response elements. The target genes includ e those encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) , epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet -derived growth factor (PDGF ), transforming growth factor alpha (TGF α), erythropoietin (EPO), cyclin D, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), interleukin-6 (IL -6) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) . Additionally, HIF upregulates the nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) which is a transcription factor that contributes to ccRCC development and may be responsible for resistance of the tumour to many forms of therapy [11]. pVHL also inhibits a pro -carcinogenic Wnt/β -catenin pathway by promoting the ubiquitination of the Wnt signaling protein Disheveled [12]. In the presence of normal oxygen tension in the tissue"
13,page_13,"Protocol Identifying Number: P S-001 Protocol Version: 1.0 Protocol Date: 10 Sep 2017 Page 14 of 60 microenvironment, the HIF α subunits are recognized by pVHL, polyubiquitinated, and then destroyed by the proteasome. Under low oxygen conditions or in the absence of functional pVHL, the α subunit is stabilized and dimerizes with a β subunit. Further, HIF heterodimer accumulates within the cytoplasm, translocates to the nucleus where targets hypoxia responsive genes . Using this pathway, HIF is involved in numerous processes, including cell proliferation, angiogenesis, extracellu lar matrix degradation, vascular tone, and erythropoiesis - all the processes involved in cancer development . Therefore, when VHL gene performs in a normal pattern, it acts as a tumour-supressor [13, 14]. One of the recent studies reported the prevalence o f VHL loss in ccRCC to be as high as 91%. VHL mutation occurred in 83.4% of cases, whereas methylation of multiple promoter sites inactivating VHL was observed in another 8.3% of cases, none containing VHL mutations [1 5]. Multiple studies show ed that VHL loss occurred early in the development of ccRCC. The intratumoural heterogeneity of ccRCC and the discovery of differential HIFα expression patterns in pVHL-defective ccRCC results in suspicion that VHL loss may set the stage for a branched evolution of tumorigenesis in which HIF family members can become deregulated in different ways, leading to varying phenotypes of disease [16]. 1.1.3 The Role of B eta-adrenerg ic Recep tors in Carcinogenesis Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that innervates every major organ system of the body is responsible for fight -or-flight stress responses. Due to physiological, psychological, and environmental threats to homeostasis it releases catecholamine neurotransmitters: norepinephrine (NE) via neural junctions and epinephrine (E) from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla into circulating blood. Seconds after an acute stress-evoking event NE and E levels may increase by more than 10 -fold. However, basal levels also slightly vary over time and differ in solid tissues versus blood [17]. NE and E act via α 1, α2, β1, β2, and β3 receptors which are distributed distinctly across different types of tissues where are responsible for numerous physiological processes . The a ctivation of the β1 receptor include increased cardiac output, renin release from juxtaglom erular cells of the kidney , increased ghrelin form the stomach. T he activation of the β2 receptor results in actions such as smooth muscle relaxation in bronchi, gastrointestinal tract, and vessels, anabolism in skeletal muscles, insulin secretion, gly coge nolysis, whereas the β3 receptor is responsible for lipolysis in adipose tissue. Binding NE and E to β receptors stimulates adenyl cyclase (AC) to synthesize cyclic 3′ – 5′ adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). cAM P regulates multiple cellular processes via two major pathways. The first pathway is based on activation of protein kinase A (PKA) that phosphorylates serine or threonine residues on target proteins. The regulation of cellular processes via PKA includes metabolism, differentiation, morphology, motility, s ecretion, neurotransmission, and gene transcription. The effect on gene expression is mediated by PKA-induced phosphorylation of the cAMP response element binding protein/a ctivating transcription factor (CREB/ATF) family. These transcription factors engage approximately 20% of human genes [18, 19]. The second , PKA- independent pathway uses the guanine nucleotide exchange protein activated by a denylyl cyclase (EPAC) activates the Ras -like guanine triphosphatase Rap1A that results in stimulation of mitogen- activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK). The effect of this stimulation is an engagement of downstream effectors such as B-Raf kinase, mitogen -activated protein kinase kinase ( MEK ) 1/2, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases ( ERK) 1/2. All these factors play important role in cell growth, proliferation, morphology, motility, and secretion dynamics [20]."
14,page_14,"Protocol Identifying Number: P S-001 Protocol Version: 1.0 Protocol Date: 10 Sep 2017 Page 15 of 60 In the preclinical studies, activation of β -adrenergic receptors by stress hormones has been found to play significant role in tumour progression. The AC -cAMP -PKA pathway enables phosphorylation of CREB that induces the transcription of genes encoding numerous factors responsible for angiogenesis (VEGF), tissue invasion ( matrix metalloproteinases [MMPs ] 2/9), and inflammation (IL -6, IL -8). The cAMP/PKA/phosp hoinositide 3 -kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mTOR/p70S6 kinase stimulates VEGF expression dependent on HIF1 α [21-24]. The PKA -independent pathway was reported to induce NFκB and activator protein 1 (AP-1) that regulate the translation of VEGF, MMPs and interleukins [25]. The stimulation of β 2-adrenoceptors activates actin -related proto -oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src and subsequently phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) that results in lower level of anoikis [26]. Furthermore, β2-adrenoceptor stimulation by adrenaline leads to PKA-dependent BCL2 - associated death protein (BAD) phosphorylation which results in resistance to chemotherapy- induced apoptosis [27]. The activation of PKA-dependent pathway by NE results in Src and signal transducer and activator of transcription -3 (STAT -3) stimulation that may drive the growth, invasion and metastasis proce ss in ovarian cancer [28, 29]. On the other hand, a metastatic switch may be triggered by the tumour -infiltrating macrophages that produce various pro -metastatic factors after stress hormones release [30]. The β-adrenergic signaling may also inhibit p53 -mediated DNA repair [31], suppress cytotoxic T lymphocyte and natural killer ( NK) cell responses [32], inhibit expression of interferons [33], upregulate the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) signal ing pathway [34] and induce the snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SNAI2) which regulates the epithelial- mesenchymal transition (EMT) [35]. Theoretically, the β -adrenergic tumour growth might be driven via circulating catecholamines or via NE local release from SNS nerve fibers. Recent studies, however, suggest that the second option is most possible. In ovarian cancer tissues E is not detectable and concomitantly NE levels are higher than those in circulating blood. What is more, intratumour NE levels correlate with patient psychosocial risk factors and with tumor gene expression profiles, whereas NE and E blood levels do not [36, 37]. Human breast and ovarian cancer tissues are extensively innervated by peri-vascular fibers that may supply tumour and stromal cells with NE [3 0, 38]. It was also found that social stress enhances sympathetic innervation of primate lymph nodes [39] and similar phenomenon in tumour tissues cannot be excluded . 1.1.4 The P lace of S unitinib in Treatment of Metastatic RCC Surgical resection remains the only known effective treatment for localized renal cell carcinoma, but it also is used for palliation in metastatic disease. Clinical studies showed that nephrectomy increases effectiveness of further systemic therapies [40, 41]. Moreover, if the metastases are singular and resectable, metastasectomy should be also performed. Resection of single metastases from lung, brain or liver can provide a long time without starting a systemic treatment [42, 43]. For decades, treatment with classic chemotherapy was unsuccessful in pa tients with metastatic disease . Interleukin-2 ( Il-2) and Interferon alpha (IFN-α) introduced in 1990s were the first drugs that were able to evoke dramatic and durable tumor regression, however in small percentage of patients with significant toxic side effects [44]. Sequencing of human VHL (von Hippel -Lindau) gene and the discovery that its abnormalities are found in majority of clear -cell RCC cases were a mile -step in development of active agents. Currently, they include VEGF R-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib, axitinib, lenvatinib and cabozantinib), VEGF antibody (bevacizumab),"
15,page_15,"Protocol Identifying Number: P S-001 Protocol Version: 1.0 Protocol Date: 10 Sep 2017 Page 16 of 60 mTOR pathway inhibitors (temsirolimus and everolimus ) and programmed death-1 (PD -1) antibody (nivolumab) [45]. All these agents demonstrated clinical benefit in many investigational studies and have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Sunitinib is an orally administrated drug that was approved by FDA in 2005. It is a n inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) -α, -β, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) -1, -2, -3, KIT (v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog), FLT -3 (fms - related tyrosine kinase 3) , CSF -1R (colony stimulating factor 1 receptor) and rearranged during transfection (RET) proto -oncogene. In a l arge phase III registration study (NCT00098657) sunitinib was superior in efficacy when compared to IFN-α in the control arm. There were 750 previousl y untreated patients with metastatic disease enrolled into the trial, with randomization ratio 1:1 in both arms. Patients in investigational arm received sunitinib at a dose of 50 mg daily for four weeks, then two weeks without medication (a six-week cycle). In control arm IFN-α was given as a subcutaneous injection three times per week on nonconsecutive days at 3 million units ( MU) per dose during the first week, 6 MU per dose the second week, and 9 MU per dose thereafter. A dose reduction was allowed due to severe or uncontrolled adverse effects (to 37 .5 mg and then to 25 mg daily for sunitinib, and to 6 MU and then to 3 MU three times per week for IFN-α). Median progression-free survival ( PFS) was 11.0 months for sunitinib vs 5.0 months for IFN-α (Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.42, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.32 -0.54, p<0.001) . Median overall survival ( OS) was 24. 6 vs. 21.8 (HR=0.821, 95% CI: 0. 673-1. 001, p=0.051) and objective response rate ( ORR ) was 31% (95% CI: 26 to 36) vs. 6% (95% CI : 4% to 9%) for sunitinib and IFN-α , respectively. All-grade a dverse events occurred more frequently in the sunitinib group than in the IFN -α group. Patients in the sunitinib group, as compared with those in the IFN-α group, had higher rates of grade 3 diarrhea (5% vs. no cases), vomiting (4% vs. 1%), hypertension (8% vs. 1%), and the hand –foot syndrome (5% vs. no cases, p<0.05 for all comparisons). Treatment -related grade 3 or 4 fatigue was significantly higher among patients in the IF N-α group than in the sunitinib group (12% vs. 7%, p<0.05). Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred more often in the sunitinib group than in the IFN -α group ( p<0.05 for all comparisons) [46]. In a retrospective, population -base d analysis, efficacy of sunitinib was similar as in the registration study. Based on data of 6159 sunitinib -treated patients, median OS was 22.3 months (95% CI: 21.4 -23.2), whereas median PFS was 8.4 months (95% CI 8.2 -8.7). Response to sunitinib therapy was assessed in 5561 patients of whom 1687 (30%) achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) [47]. Recent retrospective analysis of Bracarda et al. showed improved safety profile of patients who moved to a modified 2/1 schedule of sunitinib compared with that observed during the initial 4/2 schedule, without sacrifice the efficacy [48]. In a randomized phase II study of Lee et al., sunitinib administered with a 2/1 schedule was associated with less toxicity and higher 6-month failure-free surviv al than a 4/2 schedule, without compromising the efficacy in terms of ORR and time -to-progression [49]. 1.2 Propranolol 1.2.1 Pharmacology Propranolol (1 -naphthalen -1-yloxy -3-(propan-2-ylamino)propan-2-ol) , firstly developed in the 1960s, is a non -cardiose lective sympatholytic β-adrenergic bl ocker with a similar binding affinity for β 1- and"
16,page_16,"Protocol Identifying Number: P S-001 Protocol Version: 1.0 Protocol Date: 10 Sep 2017 Page 17 of 60 β2- and a much lower affinity (approximately 100-fold) for the β3 -adrenoreceptor [50]. It possesses no other autonomic nervous system activity . After complete β -adrenoreceptor blockage, the NE release in synapsis may only result in α -adrenoceptor activation, and thus propranolol is considered as a weak indirect α -adrenoceptor agonist [51]. At dosages greater than required for β blockade it presents with strong membrane st abilizing activity. There is also an evidence that propranolol may function as an antagonist of 5 -HT 1A and 5 -HT 1B serotonin receptors [52]. After oral intake, propranolol undergoes rapid absorption in the intestine. It is highly lipophilic and more than 90 % bound with plasma proteins. Peak plasma concentrations occur about 1 to 4 hours after an oral dose. Plasma half-life is 3 to 6 hours following single dose or 10 hours for extended release tablets. Mean peak plasma concentration following a single oral do se of 40 mg and 160 mg is 38 ng/ml and 200 -245 ng/ml, respectively. The extended release tablets result in a peak of 18 -50 ng/ml. Bioavailability after oral administration is within the range of 25-35% due to extensive first - pass hepatic clearance and may be increased up by 50% during concomitant food intake with no further change in time to peak concentration, plasma binding, half -life, or the amount of unchanged drug in the urine. Propranolol crosses the blood -brain barrier and the placenta, and is distri buted into breast milk. Its volume of distribution is approximately 4 liters/kg. The metabolism of propranolol takes place mainly in the liver and involves cytochromes P (CYPs) CYP2D6, CYP1A2 and CYP2C19. Propranolol is also a substrate for the intestinal efflux transporter, p -glycoprotein. Excretion is primarily renal, but about 1 -4% of a dose is found in the faeces as unchanged drug and metabolites. Propranolol plasma clearance is reduced in elderly and Caucasians, as well as in patients with chronic rena l failure and cirrhosis. Blood levels of propranolol may be increased by co- administration with substrates or inhibitors of CYP2D6 (i.e. amiodarone, cimetidine, delavudin, fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine, and ritonavir), CYP1A2 (i.e. imipramine, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine, isoniazid, ritonavir, theophylline, zileuton, zolmitriptan, and rizatriptan), and CYP2C19 (i.e. fluconazole, cimetidine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, tenioposide, and tolbutamide). Blood levels of propranolol may be decreased by co-administration with CYP inducers such as rifampin, ethanol, phenytoin, phenobarbital and cigarette smoking. Propranolol is not significantly dialyzable [53-56]. 1.2.2 Current Indications and Dosing Currently, propranolol is used in the treatment of hyp ertension, angina pectoris, cardiac dysrhythmias, tachycardia, anxiety, thyr otoxicosis , infantile hemangiomas (IH), and essential tremor. It is used in prophylaxis of migraine and upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding in patients with portal hypertension as well as for the long term prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients who have shown evidence of dysrhythmias during the acute phase of myocardial infarction . Usually, t he initial propranolol dose in adults is 40 mg two or three times daily and may b e increased by the same amount at weekly intervals to a maximum daily dose of 320 mg (immediate-release tablets). If it is necessary to withdraw propranolol, this should be done gradually, or another β - adrenergic receptor blocker should be substituted [53, 57]. 1.2.3 Antineoplastic Potential Pre-clinical studies revealed wide a ntineoplastic potential of propranolol that includes inhibiton of proliferation, migration, invasion and angiogenesis, as well as induction of apoptosis, treatment sensitization and immunomodulation. P ropranolol decreased proliferation rate associated with"
17,page_17,"Protocol Identifying Number: P S-001 Protocol Version: 1.0 Protocol Date: 10 Sep 2017 Page 18 of 60 catecholamines or isoproterenol in colorectal, pancreatic and lung adenocarcinoma cancer cells [5 8- 60]. In oral squamous cell carcinoma cells proliferation was induced via β2 signalling pathway activated by IL -6 after stimulation of NE and isoproterenol. Then the proliferation rate was inhibited by IL -6 specific antibody and propranolol [61]. Similarly, a decreased level of IL -6 concomitantly with inhibition of metastatic gr owth was reported in a murine melanoma model after propranolol treatment [6 2]. Propranolol was more potent in reducing the proliferation, migration, and invasion of non-stimulated breast, colon, and hepatocellular cancer cells than the selective β1 recepto r agonist, atenolol [6 3]. Propranolol inhibited the NE-induced upregulation of MMP -2 and MMP -9 which are respo nsible for tissue remodeling process. This resulted in decreased tumour invasion of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, pancr eatic cancer, gastric adenocarcinoma, melanoma, prostate cancer and IH [64-71]. NE induces EMT via TGF -β-adrenoreceptor pathway that leads to increased metastatic potential and this effect was shown to be inhibited in colorectal cancer cell lines by propranolol [7 2]. In breast cancer cell lines, isoproterenol reduced Rap1 -dependent cell - cell adhesion and promoted cell migration, whereas propranolol reduced the level of migration [7 3]. Catecholamine signaling was also reported to increase breast cancer cell colonization of bone via upregulation of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa -B ligand ( RANKL ), which was reversed by propranolol or the RANKL inhibitor denosumab [7 4]. Propranolol induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis i n gastric carcinoma cell lines that was associated with a decrease of NF-κB, VEGF, cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 , MMP -2 and MMP -9 expression [68]. The pro -apoptotic effect of propranolol was observed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and neuroblastoma cell lines and was connected to increased expression of p53 and p73 proteins [75, 76]. In another study on hemangioblastoma cells from vHL patients, propranolol decreased the viability and increased apoptosis that was associated with a decreased the expression of HIF protein and its target genes [77]. In ovarian cancer cell lines, propranolol blocked the angiogenesis by decreasing the VEGF expression which was previously stimulated by β-adrenergic agonists. Catecholamine induction of PKA-dependent signaling pathway was identified as a major mechanism by which behavioural stress enhanced tumour angiogenesis [7 8]. Propranolol inhibited brain endothelial cells tubulogenesis and matrix MMP -9 secretion in human glioblastoma [7 9]. HIF -1α expression was reported to be upregulated by NE, via the cAMP/PKA/Akt/p70S6K pathway, whereas propranolol completely abolished induction of VEGF expression and HIF-1 α protein amount by NE and resulted in decreased angiogenesis in vari ous cancer cell lines [ 80]. Propranolol also exhibited a potential to revert drug resistance of some leukemia cell lines to doxorubicin and revealed synergistic role with paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil in number of human cancer and non- cancer cell lines [ 81, 82]. Catecholamines were reported to reduce NK cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte numbers as well as tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNFα) and IFN-γ levels and this could be reversed by propranolol [8 3-85 ]. A positive effect of propranolol on cancer has been observed in epidemiological studies that assessed hypertensive and non -hypertensive patients . The study of Chang et al. compared 12119 patients treated with propranolol for more than 6 months to 12119 non -propranolol users over a 12 year period. Overall, the incidence for developing cancer was lower in the propranolol cohort (HR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.67-0.85; p<0.001). Site specific analysis showed a decreased risk in head and neck cancers (HR= 0.58; 95% CI: 0.35-0.95), oesophagus (HR=0.35; 95% CI : 0.13-0.96), stomach (HR =0.54; 95% CI: 0.30-0.98), colon (HR=0.68; 95% CI: 0.49-0.93), and prostate ca ncers (HR =0.52; 95% CI: 0.33-0.83) [86]. The s tudy of Nkontchou showed that the use of propranolol in patients with cirrhosis due to"
18,page_18,"Protocol Identifying Number: P S-001 Protocol Version: 1.0 Protocol Date: 10 Sep 2017 Page 19 of 60 hepatitis C was associated with a decreased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HR=0.25; 95% CI: 0.09- 0.65; p=0.004) [87]. In the study of Barron et al. women treated with propranolol (n=70) or atenolol (n=525) in the year prior to breast cancer diagnosis were matched with women not receiving β - blocker treatment (n=4738). Patients in the propranolol group had lower risk of having T4 (odds ratio [OR]=0.24, 95% CI: 0.07- 0.85) or N2/N3/M1 (OR=0.20; 95% CI: 0.04-0.88) tumor compared with matched non -users. The cumulative probability of breast cancer- specific mortality was significantly lower for propranolol users compared with matched nonusers (HR=0.19; 95% CI: 0.06 -0.60). There was no difference in T4 or N2/N3/M1 tumor incidence or breast cancer -specific mortality between atenolol users and matched non- users [88 ]. Propranolol was also assessed in small interventional studies. In a series of seven cases of advanced angiosarcoma , propranolol (40 mg twice daily) was combined with weekly vinblastine (intravenous [IV] 6 mg/m2 to a maximum of 10 mg) and methotrexate (35 mg/m2 to a maximum of 50 mg) for up to 12 months followed by maintenance of propranolol (40 mg twice daily), oral etoposide (50 mg/day) and oral cyclophosphamide (50 mg/day) for 20 consecutive days in cycles of 30 days. The treatment was we ll tolerated and resulted in ORR of 100%. Median PFS and OS were 11 months (range 5 -24) and 16 months (range 10 -30), respectively [8 9]. A combination of propranolol (20 mg twice daily, then titrated to maintain heart rate around 80 per minute) plus etodola c (400 mg twice daily) with metronomic temozolomide was compared to temozolomide monotherapy in 32 patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Patients treated with combination therapy had greater median time to progression (8.8 months versus 5.2 months), 6 -mont hs survival rate (63% versus 40%) and 1 -year survival rate (22% versus 12%) than those treated with temozolomide monotherapy, respectively [90]. The same combination of propranolol and etodolac was tested with concomitant nab -paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in advanced pancreatic cancer. Patients randomized to four -drug therapy had greater PFS (11.8 months versus 7.2 months) and OS (15.9 months versus 10.5 months) than those receiving standard two -drug, respectively. Additionally, patients receiving propranolol plus etodolac experienced reduced pain and neuropathy and increased weight gain [91]. As a β-blocker, propranolol may also reduce the level of emotional distress, measured in terms of the number and rate of intrusive thoughts, associated with a cancer diagnosis [9 2]. 1.2.4 Safety Results Propranolol is generally a well tolerated drug. Its adverse effects are listed in Section 7 .2.2. The initiation of propranolol may lead to initial adverse effects which may resolve during dose titration to a maintenance dose. Sudden termination of treatment is not advised. The dose should be tapered rather than stopped abruptly. There are no reports of increased toxicity of propranolol in patients with cancer likewise during combining propranolol with other antineoplastic agents mentioned in Section 1.2.3. Because sunitinib can prolong the PR interval of the elect rocardiogram in some patients , theoretically, its coadministration with propranolol, which also prolongs the PR interval, may result in increased risk of conduction disturbances and atrioventricular block. Thus, caution is advised if sunitinib is used conc omitantly with propranolol, especially in the elderly and patients with known conduction problems (e.g., marked first -degree atrioventricular [AV ] block; second-degree or higher AV block; sick sinus syndrome without pacemaker) or severe cardiac disease such as myocardial ischemia or heart failure. Despite the presence of sunitinib for more than 10 years in clinical practice,"
19,page_19,"Protocol Identifying Number: P S-001 Protocol Version: 1.0 Protocol Date: 10 Sep 2017 Page 20 of 60 no serious cardiac and other type toxicity was reported for coadministration of sunitinib and propranolol. 1.3 Study Rationale Nowaday s, first-line treatment with sunitinib is standard of care in patients with metastatic RCC who are classified into favourable- or intermediate -risk group according to Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center ( MSKCC) criteria . However, disease progression occ urs in most cases as cancer cells are primary or secondary resistant to sunitinib. Therefore, new strategies are needed to provide an improved option with maximal curative potential. New therapeutic approaches include combining sunitinib with autologous dendritic cell immunotherapy, AGS -003 (NCT01582672) , PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab with VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab ( NCT02420821), PD -L1 inhibitor avelumab with VEGFR inhibitor axitinib ( NCT02684006), VEGFR/fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) inhibitor lenvatinib with PD -1 inhibitor pembrolizumab (NCT02811861), and dual checkpoint inhibition: PD -1 inhibitor nivolumab with cytotoxic T -lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA -4) inhibitor ipilimumab (NCT02231749). Other directions in development of improved tr eatment options in metastatic RCC are focused on drugs available on the market for years that are prescribed primarily for non -malignant diseases. Their antitumor activity was confirmed in preclinical studies and now they are being investigated in clinical trials. These studies include dalteparin, a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in combination with sunitinib in first-lline setting (NCT01061411); prednisone, a glucocorticoid, in combination with everolimus in VEGFR pre-treated patients (NCT02479490); h ydroxychloroquine, antimalaric drug, in combination with IL-2 (NCT01550367); metformin, an anti -diabetic biguanide, in combination with vandetanib in hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC), succinate- dehydrogenase (SDH) mutation -associated RCC (SDH -RCC) or sporadic papillary RCC (NCT02495103); a monotherapy with low dose naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, for metastatic melanoma, castrate resistant prostate cancer or RCC (NCT01650350). Since 1960s, propranolol is used worldwide in different indications, mostly for treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Despite numerous pre-clinical and clinical studies that described i ts antineoplastic potential, it w as not studied extensively as a pure anti-cancer agent in RCC . In the current clinical practic e, its anti-tumour activity is limited to benign tumour - IH. Due to favourable toxicity profile and 82 -100% overall response rate, oral propranolol is first-line option in treatment of IH, particularly for complicated and ulcerated forms. It has early, in termediate and long-ter m pharmacological effect on IH. The early effect is a visible change in colour and softening of the lesion that occurs 1 -3 days since the therapy initiation. This is related to the β2 inhibition which results in vasoconstriction due to decreased concentration of vasodilators, such as nitric oxide. The intermediate effect involves inhibition of proangiogenic cascade and angiogenesis as a consequence of VEGF and fibroblast growth factor ( FGF) downregulation. The long term effect is due to cell apoptosis resulting in regression of haemangiomas [9 3]. In the recent consensus, a target daily dose of 1-3 mg/kg has been recommended [94]. Based on a randomized controlled trial performed by Hogeling et al., the treatment should last for at least 6 months which can be modified according to the morphological subtypes [95]."
20,page_20,"Protocol Identifying Number: P S-001 Protocol Version: 1.0 Protocol Date: 10 Sep 2017 Page 21 of 60 Successful treatment of IH with propranolol le ads us to investigate whether this drug is able to present similar anti -tumour a ctivity in RCC that, in fact, is a highly vascularized neoplasm. Its molecular mechanism s of action involve inhibition of signaling pathways that are crucial in RCC development and may be exacerbated by intra -tumour release of stress -related hormones . Propranolol not only inhibits a catecholamine-dependent cancer cell growth and expansion, but simultaneously inhibits VEGF -dependent angiogenesis that is also a main target for currently used drugs in RCC, including sunitinib. Therefore, a combination of propranolol and sunitinib may result in synergistic anti-tumour effect. It is also worthwhile to mention other molecular actions of propranolol that include inhibition of cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion (Figure 1 ). Together with reduction of emotional stress related to cancer diagnosis, propranolol may bring multidirectional benefit for RCC patients treated with sunitinib. Additionally, in colon adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma and melanoma cell lines and mouse models , exogenous N E and chron ic stress attenuated the efficacy of sunitinib, primarily through promoting expression of VEGF, IL -6 and IL -8 that was chiefly mediated by β-adrenergic/cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. This negative impact of stress/N E on sunitinib efficacy was blocked by propranolol [9 6, 97]. All the data mentioned above imply that propranolol may increase efficacy of first -line sunitinib in patients with metastatic RCC. As a safe and well tolerant medication it is widely prescribed in treatment of non -malignant diseases, also within a subgroup of patients with metastatic RCC treated with sunitinib. Furthermore, no significant negative interactions (including life- threatening) between propranolol and sunitinib were reported in the literature. As a hypotensive drug, propranolol w ould be concomitant and suitable option in management of sunitinib -induced hypertension. Finally, the potential benefit of adding propranolol to a standard -of-care sunitinib would not lead to financial overload as the monthly cost of propranolol is only ab out $2. To conclude, the molecular antineoplastic profile of propranolol, its potential synergism with sunitinib, favourable safety profile, hypotensive potential for sunitinib-induced hypertension, ability to reduce cancer -associated anxiety and low cost of intervention encourage us to assess prospectively the combination of propranolol and sunitinib in first -line treatment of metastatic RCC."

Modalities of administration: 1 capsule (50 mg or 37 .5 mg [alternatively: 1 capsule 25 mg + 1 capsule 12.5 mg] or 25 mg) every day during the treatment period. Capsule must be admini stered orally , with or without food . Dosage: starting dose is 50 mg taken once daily, for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2 -week rest period (s chedule 4/2) to comprise a complete cycle of 6 weeks. The schedule may be changed by the Investigator to 2 weeks on / 1 week off to decrease the level of toxic effects. Dose modifications in 12.5 mg steps may be applied based on individual safety and tolerability. Daily dose can not be either decreased below 25 mg or increased over 50 mg. If there are suspicions of its unacceptable toxicity, it must be withdrawn immediately. There is no specific antidote for overdose with sunitinib and treatment of overdose should consist of general supportive measures. If indicated, elimination of unabsorbed active substance may be achieved by emesis or gastric lavage. 5.1.2 Propranolol (Propranolol Accord® by Accord Healthcare Ltd.)

In case of propranolol overdose, atropine 1 to 2 mg intravenously can counter excessive bradycardia. If necessary this may be followed by a bolus dose of glucagon 10 mg intravenously. If required, this may be followed or repeated by an intravenous infusion of glucagon 1 to 10 mg/hour depending on response. If no response is received to the glucagon or if glucagon is unavailable, a beta-adrenoceptor stimulant e.g. dobutamine 2.5 to 10 microgram/kg/minute by intravenous infusion may be given. Bronchospasm may be treated by nebulized salbutamol or intravenous aminophylline or salbutamol. Severe cases may require the use of oxygen or artificial ventilation. When it has been decided to interrupt a β -blockade in preparation for surgery, therapy should be discontinued for at least 48 hours. Continuation of beta -blockade reduces the risk of arrhythmias during induction a nd intubation; however the risk of hypotension may be increased as well. If treatment is continued, caution should be observed with the use of certain anaesthetic drugs. The patient may be protected against vagal reactions by intravenous administration of atropine. 5.2 Concomitant Treatment 5.2.1 Prohibited Concomitant T reatment • Any drugs that have been approved in antitumor therapies or any new potentially antineoplastic agen ts that are being investigated (e.g. IL -2, IFN, cabozantinib, sorafenib, axitinib, dovitinib, pazopanib, lenvatinib, evero limus, temsirolimus, nivolumab, ipilimumab). • CYP3A4 inducers /inhibitors : carbamezepine, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, nafcillin, phenobarbital, St John’s wort, itraconazole, ketoconazole, erythromycinum, clarithrom ycinum, nefazodone. • Immunosuppressors and immunomodulators including chronic systemic corticosteroids. • β-agonist s, β-blockers other than propranolol, bronchodilators, calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem or bepridil), fingolimod, barbiturates, propafenone, monoamine oxidase inhibitors."

During the postdiscontinuation period, information about date of disease progression, death , adverse events, subsequent anticancer systemic therapy, radiotherapy, or surgical intervention will be collected. In case of disease progression and the need for second-line anticancer therapy, propranolol may be continued beyond first-line progression if the drug is well tolerated and there are other indications to continue β -adrenergic blockade. It may be also replaced by other β-blocker, if necessary. Cessation of propranolol therapy should be gradual. 6.6.4 Unscheduled Visits or Assessments If the investigator deter mines that a subject should be monitored more frequently or with additional laboratory parameters assessments than indicated by the protocol-defined visit schedule, unscheduled visits or assessments are permitted. Unscheduled visits for radiographic evalua tions are allowed at any time as clinically indicated. 7. Adverse Events 7.1 Adverse Events D efinitions An adverse event (AE) is the development of an undesirable medical condition or the deterioration of a pre-existing medical condition during treatment.

The investigator has to care about patient with bes t medical knowledge and available methods of treatment and should follow up the outcome of adverse events (clinical signs, laboratory values or other, etc) until the return to normal or stabilization of the patient's condition. Dose modification for drug induced toxicity should be kept with accordance to Summary of Product Characteristics of all used drugs. 7.4 Adverse Events M onitoring and Reporting All Adverse Events regardless of seriousness or relationship to investigational products have to be recorde d on the corresponding page(s) included in the CRF. The Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to investigational products, corrective treatment/therapy given, outcome and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the i nvestigational products. In the case of a SAE the Investigator must send the signed and dated corresponding page(s) in the CRF to the representative of the Monitoring Team and attach a copy of all exa minations carried out with dates on which these examinations were performed. 8. Statistical C onsiderations 8.1 Study Hypotheses Primary hypothesis is whether addition of oral propranolol to sunitinib in first -line treatment of metastatic RCC can increase its antitumor efficacy and it is related to analyses of: ORR, PFS, OS, and DCR. Secondary hypothesis is whether addition of oral propranolol to sunitinib in first -line treatment of metastatic RCC is safe and has an influence on patient -reported quality of l ife and disease-related stress and it is referred to analyses of: adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, laboratory tests, health- related quality of life and disease -related stress ."
38,page_38,"Protocol Identifying Number: P S-001 Protocol Version: 1.0 Protocol Date: 10 Sep 2017 Page 39 of 60 8.2 Sample S ize Calculation According to registration study for sunitinib and a recent population -based study, the ORR of sunitinib monotherapy is estimated to be around 30% [46, 47]. Because strong potential bias exists due to single -center and phase II study design, we assume an increase to 55% of the ORR under propranolol plus sunitinib therapy as a combination worthwhile for further investigation. The optimal two -stage Simon design is to test the null hypothesis that P ≤ 0.300 versus the alternative that P ≥ 0. 550 has an expected sample size of 17.36 and a probab ility of early termination of 0.869 . If the combination of propranolol and sunitinib is actually not effective, there is a 0.0 50 probability of concluding that it is (the target for this value [ α level] was 0.050). If the combination is actually effective, there is a 0.19 5 probability of concluding that it is not (the target for this value [β - level] was 0.200). After testing the combination on 15 patients in the first stage, the trial will be terminated if 6 or fewer achieve ORR. If the trial goes on to the second stage, a total of 33 patients will be studied. If the total number achieving ORR is less than or equal to 1 3, the combination is rejected. 8.3 General Considerations The analyses will be performed on all patients who r eceived at least one dose of s tudy medication s. Descriptive statistics, including the mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range, minimum, and maximum values will be provided for continuous variables as well as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables . Characte ristics such as patient age, gender, height, weight, medical history, and Karnofsky performance status, concomitant therapies, as well as baseline signs and symptoms will be tabulated. Study drug administration will be described in terms of the total number of cycles administered, the median (range) of cycles administered, dose intensity, and reasons for the deviations from planned therapy. A detailed description of patient disposition will be provided. It will include: summary of patients screened, total n umber of patients enrolled, total number of patients discontinuing the study. A detailed summary of reasons for patient discontinuation from study treatment will be provided. 8.4 Primary and Secondary Endpoints Analyses 8.4.1 ORR and DCR Analys is The respo nse (CR, PR, SD, PD, ORR, and DCR according to RECIST guidelines (version 1.1)) will be summarized for studied patients as frequency and percentages with 2-sided 95% CI calculated using the Clopper- Pearson method. To indirectly compare ORR and DCR of pati ents treated with propranolol and sunitinib combination versus sunitinib monotherapy, a group of patients treated with sunitinib monotherapy will be drawn from the institution historical cohort. This control group will consist of 33 consecutive patients th at started sunitinib monotherapy just before the beginning of the present study . The comparison will be"

The median event time and corresponding 2 -sided 95% CI for the median will be provided using log-log transformation . In an exploratory analysis that aims to identify independent prognostic factors for OS and PFS, the multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression will be used. T he variables with p value less than 0.05 will be assumed as independently affecting OS and PFS. To indirectly compare OS and PFS of patients treated with propranolol and sunitinib combination versus sunitinib monoth erapy , a group of patients treated with sunitinib monotherapy will be drawn from the institution historical cohort. This control group will consist of 33 consecutive patients that started sunitinib monotherapy just before the beginning of the present study . The comparison will be made using the unadjusted log-rank test and the adjusted log-rank test based on the inverse probability of treatment weighting [9 7]. The unstratified and stratified by the MSKCC risk group (favourable versus intermediate) multivari able Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to assess the impact of the drug combination on OS and PFS. 8.4.3 Safety A nalys is Summary tables will present the number of patients observed with adverse events and corresponding percentages. Additiona lly, the following safety -related outcomes will be summarized: study treatment discontinuations due to adverse events, deaths during the study treatment period, severe adverse events during the study treatment period, hospitalizations and transfusions duri ng the study treatment period.

Baseline assessments must be performed within the period defined in the protocol . Measurable lesions: Except for lymph nodes as described below, measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 10 mm with CT scan (if CT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm the minimum size for a measurable lesion is twice the slice thickness). • To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be ≥ 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and r ecorded. • MRI may be substituted for contrast -enhanced CT for lesions at some anatomical sites, but not for lesions in the lungs. The minimum size for measurability is the same as for CT (10 mm) as long as the scans are performed with slice thickness of 5 mm and no gap. If MRI is performed with thicker slices, the size of a measurable lesion at baseline should be twice the slice thickness. In the event there are interslice gaps, this also needs to be considered in determining the size of measurable lesions at baseline. Nonmeasurable lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to < 15 mm short axis), are considered nonmeasurable. Lymph nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered nonpathological and are not be recorded or followed. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/ pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, and abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI), are considered as nonmeasurable. Target lesions: All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, are to be identified as target lesions and measured and recorded at baseline. Target lesions are to be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, and be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, t he largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. Target lesions will be measured at each assessment (longest axis for nonnodal lesions, shortest axis for measurable malignant nodal lesions). Nontarget lesions: All other lesions (or sites of disease) including all non-measurable lesions (including pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis) and all measurable lesions over and ab ove the 5 target lesions are to be identified as non-target lesions and recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each is to be recorded throughout follow -up. Lymph nodes that have a short axis < 10mm are considered non -pathological and are not to be recorded or followed. To be considered progression of non-target lesions in the presence of measurable disease, unequivocal progression is defined as substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in"
52,page_52,"Protocol Identifying Number: P S-001 Protocol Version: 1.0 Protocol Date: 10 Sep 2017 Page 53 of 60 the presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinuation of the therapy. Special Consideration Lesions by clinical examination will not be used for response in this study. Cystic lesions • Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor nonmeasurable) since they are, by definition, simple cysts. • Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if noncystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for select ion as target lesions. Bone lesions • Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are not considered adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions. • Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated by cross-sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurability described above. • Blastic bone lesions are non-measurable. Lesions with prior local treatment • Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco -regional therapy, are not considered measurable. Imaging M ethods The same method of assessment and the same technique used to characterize each identified and reported lesions at baseline should be used during each follow-up assessment. All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. Imaging based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but assessed by clinical examination (referring to biopsy -proven visible lesion(s) on the chest). Chest x -ray: Chest x -ray will not be used for response assessment in this study. Conventional CT and MRI: This guideline has defined measurability of lesions on CT scan based on the assumption that CT slice thickness is 5 mm or less. If CT scans have slice thickness g reater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion is twice the slice thickness. MRI is also acceptable in certain situations (eg, for body scan) except for lung. Use of MRI remains a complex issue. MRI has excellent contrast, spatial, and temporal resolution; however, there are many image acquisition variables involved in MRI, which greatly impact image quality, lesion conspicuity, and measurement. Furthermore, the availability of MRI is variable globally. As with CT, if an MRI is performed, the technical specifications of the scanning sequences"
53,page_53,"Protocol Identifying Number: P S-001 Protocol Version: 1.0 Protocol Date: 10 Sep 2017 Page 54 of 60 used should be optimized for the evaluation of the type and site of disease. Furthermore, as with CT, the modality used at follow -up should be the same as was used at baseline and the lesions should be measu red/assessed on the same pulse sequence. It is beyond the scope of the RECIST guidelines to prescribe specific MRI pulse sequence parameters for all scanners, body parts, and diseases. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans. Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. Positron emission tomography will not be used for response assessment in this study. Ultrasound: Ultr asound will not be used for response assessment in this study. Bone scans will be used to assess the presence or disappearance of the bone component of bone lesions. CT or MRI scan will be used to confirm ambiguous results of bone scans. Preferred method for confirmation is MRI. Time Point Assessments The frequency and schedule of tumor assessments is defined in the protocol. The schedule is to be maintained regardless of whether study treatment is held or discontinued. At baseline, tumors and lymph nodes are classified and documented as target or nontarget per the definitions provided above. It is possible to record multiple nontarget lesions involving the same organ as a single item (eg, ‘multiple liver metastases’). At all postbaseline (follow -up) evaluations the baseline classification (target, nontarget) is to be maintained and lesions are to be documented and described in a consistent fashion over time (eg, recorded in the same order on source documents). At each assessment, a sum of the diameters (longest for nonnodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and included in source documents. The baseline sum of the diameters (SoD) will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. The lowest SoD (nadir) since (and including) the baseline value will be used as reference for evaluating progression. After baseline, target lesions should have the actual size documented, if possible, even if the lesions become very small. If in the opinion of the radiologist the lesion has likely disappeared, 0 mm should be recorded. If the lesion is present but too small to measure, an indicator for ‘too small to measure’ this should be included in source documents. For target lesions, measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation. All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters. Nontarget lesions are to be assessed qualitatively (present, resolved, or unequivocal progression) and new lesions, if any, are to be documented separately. At each evaluation, progression status is to be determined based upon the time point status for target lesions, nontarget lesions, and new lesions. Finding of new lesions should not be attributable to differenc es in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumor. Necrosis of preexisting lesions as part of a response to treatment should be excluded before defining a ‘new’ cystic lesion. A lesion identified on a follow-up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at baseline is considered a new lesion. If a new lesion is equivocal because of its small size, repeat"

Time point progression can be based solely on bone scans if there is unequivocal evidence of new bone scan lesions. New bone scan lesions will be considered malignant in the absence of correlative imaging or clinical data that demonstrate lesions are not malignant. Follow up imaging may be required to ensure new lesions are unequivocal. Increases in the density or size of bone scan lesions present at baseline cannot be the basis of progression. Time point respon se (TPR) criteria Target Lesion TPR Complete Response (CR) - Disappearance of all target lesions. All pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm. Partial Response (PR) - At least a 30% decrease in SoD of target lesions, taking as a reference the baseline SoD Stable Disease (SD) - Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. Progressive Disease (PD) - At least a 20% increase in the SoD of target lesions, taking as a reference the smallest (nadir) SoD since (and including) baseline. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the SoD must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Not Applicable (NA) - No target lesion identified at baseline. Unable to Evaluate (UE) - One or more target lesions are not imaged and the remainder of the SoD compared with the nadir SoD does not meet the criterion for PD. Non-Target Lesion TPR Complete Response (CR) - Disappearance of all non -target lesions. All ly mph nodes must be nonpathological in size (<10 mm short axis) Non-CR / Non -PD - Persistence of one or more non- target lesion(s). Progressive Disease (PD) - Unequivocal progression of non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should normally trump target lesion status. It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion increase Not Applicable (NA) - No non -target lesions identified at screening Unable to Evaluate (UE) - One or more non-target lesions are not imaged and the rema ining nontarget lesions do not meet the criterion for PD. New Lesion TPR Yes - Lesion present at follow -up visit either for the very first time or reappearing (ie, lesion was present at baseline, disappeared at a follow -up visit and re-appeared later). On bone scan, a single new lesion may not be sufficient to qualify as PD. Confirmation should be obtained by performing CT or MRI of the area of concern to confirm ambiguous results of bone scan. Preferred method for confirmation is MRI. No - No new lesions present at follow -up. Unable to Evaluate (UE) - Subject not assessed or incompletely assessed for new lesions."
