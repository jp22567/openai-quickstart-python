For Mexico only: The above will include the following responsibilities for the head of the Institution/Health Care Establishment, Ethics, Research and, when applicable, Biosafety Committees and sponsor within their scope of responsibility: a) Investigation follow-up; b) Damages to health arising from the investigation development; as well as those arising from interruption or advanced suspension of treatment due to non-attributable reasons to the Subject; c) Timely compliance of the terms in which the authorization of a research for health in human beings had been issued; d) To present in a timely manner the information required by the Health Authority. In this document, the term investigator refers to the individual responsible for the overall conduct of the clinical trial at a trial site. 3.1 Background information 3.1.1 Type 2 diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive metabolic disease primarily characterised by abnormal glucose metabolism. The pathogenesis is heterogeneous involving environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors leading to chronic hyperglycaemia caused by peripheral tissue insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion due to abnormal beta-cell function and abnormal glucose metabolism in the live r3. Optimal glycaemic control is the treatment goal in subjects with T2DM in order to prevent long- term complications associated with chronic hyperglycaemia3. Despite the availability of several anti-diabetic drugs, a significant proportion of subjects with T2DM do not achieve the recommended targets for glycaemic contro l4,5. 3.1.2 Glucagon-like peptide-1 Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone with a glucose-dependent stimulatory effect on insulin and inhibitory effect on glucagon secretion from the pancreatic islets6, 7.Subjects with T2DM have a decreased incretin effec t8, 9. However, the insulinotropic action of GLP-1 and thus, the ability to lower BG levels, is preserved when GLP-1 is administered at supraphysiological levels10. In addition, supraphysiological levels of GLP-1 induce reduction in body weigh t11. GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of appetite and food intake and GLP-1 receptors are present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation12, 13. Physiologically, GLP-1 also has a pronounced inhibitory effect on gastric emptying; however this effect seems to diminish upon CONFIDENTIAL"

These mechanisms of action make GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) an attractive pharmacological treatment for T2DM14, 15. 3.1.3 Oral semaglutide Semaglutide is a long-acting GLP-1 RA structurally similar to liraglutide (Victoza®), a once-daily GLP-1 RA developed by Novo Nordisk and approved worldwide for the treatment of T2DM. Compared to human native GLP-1, which has a short half-life, the semaglutide molecule has three minor but important modifications ensuring protraction of its action: amino acid substitutions at position 8 (alanine to alpha-aminoisobutyric acid, a synthetic amino acid) and position 34 (lysine to arginine) and acylation of the peptide backbone with a spacer and C-18 fatty di-acid chain to lysine in position 2616. The fatty di-acid side chain and the spacer mediate strong binding to albumin, thereby reducing renal clearance. The amino acid substitution at position 8 makes semaglutide less susceptible to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). The change in position 34 from a lysine to an arginine is included to have only one lysine in the sequence whereto a spacer can be attached. Semaglutide is in development for oral once-daily treatment of T2DM. As the bioavailability of GLP-1 RAs is low when administered orally, semaglutide has been co-formulated with the absorption-enhancing excipient sodium N-[8-(2-hydroxybenzoyl) amino]caprylate (SNAC) to increase the bioavailability of semaglutide. The absorption-enhancing properties of SNAC co- formulation are based on the concept developed by SNAC facilitates the absorption of semaglutide in a strictly time and size dependent manner, primarily via the transcellular route. The available data for semaglutide co-formulated with SNAC support that the absorption takes place in the stomach in a localised, buffered environment in close proximity to the tablet erosion. The absorption process is hampered if dosed with food, liquid or in the presence of significant stomach content. The absorption enhancement requires co-formulation between semaglutide and SNAC. Throughout this document “oral semaglutide” will refer to the drug product, that is, semaglutide co-formulated with 300 mg SNAC. 3.1.4 Nonclinical data 3.1.4.1 Semaglutide The nonclinical programme for semaglutide was designed according to the ICH M3 guideline to support the clinical developmen t17. The standard nonclinical data package required to support phase 3 clinical trials has been completed. In addition, 2-year carcinogenicity studies and a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study have been completed. Semaglutide was generally well tolerated in animals (mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys). Two potential safety issues have been identified and these are detailed below.CONFIDENTIAL"

C-cell changes have not been observed in long-term studies in non- human primate. The observed pattern of effects in mice and rats and lack of these effects in the non- human primate and in man suggest that the mechanism by which semaglutide acts on the thyroid C- cells in rodents is the same as has been demonstrated for other GLP-1 RAs, including liraglutide. According to this mechanism, C-cell hyperplasia is mediated by the GLP-1 receptor and is not associated with RET (re-arranged during transfection) gene activation and rodents appear to be particularly sensitive, whereas humans are not. The relevance for human subjects is currently unknown, but considered to be low18. Embryo−foetal development toxicity Semaglutide caused embryo-foetal development toxicity in the rat through a GLP-1 receptor mediated effect on the inverted yolk sac placenta leading to impaired nutrient supply to the developing embryo. Primates do not have an inverted yolk sac placenta which makes this mechanism unlikely to be of relevance to humans and cynomolgus monkeys. In the developmental toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkey, a marke d maternal body weight loss associated with the pharmacological effect of semaglutide coincided with increased early foetal loss; however, there was no indication of a teratogenic potential of semaglutide in this species. A review of the results from the nonclinical studies can be found in the investigator’s brochure (IB) for semaglutide (subcutaneous administration), edition 1119and the IB for oral administration of semaglutide (NN9924), edition 720, or any updates of these documents. 3.1.4.2 SNAC SNAC was developed as an absorption-enhancing excipient for the oral route of administration.

In addition, events of lactic acidosis must be reported as an AE requiring additional data collection, please refer to section 8.4.1.2 section 12.1.5 and appendix B. The carcinogenicity studies demonstrated that SNAC was not carcinogenic to the transgenic rasH2 mouse or the Sprague-Dawley rat. The doses tested covered total exposures of SNAC in plasma (in terms of AUC) of 2-fold in the mouse and up to 44-fold in the rat when compared to the mean total exposure of SNAC in humans following a clinical dose of 300 mg SNAC/day. A review of the SNAC results from the nonclinical studies can be found in the IB for oral administration of semaglutide (NN9924), edition 720, or any updates hereof. 3.1.5 Clinical data for oral semaglutide A comprehensive clinical pharmacology programme including 12 trials has been completed, as well as a 26-week phase 2 dose-finding trial involving more than 600 subjects with T2DM. For details on the individual trials, please see the IB for oral administration of semaglutide (NN9924) edition 7, or any updates hereof. 3.1.5.1 Pharmacokinetics In the multiple-dose trial (NN9924-3991), oral semaglutide has demonstrated a long mean terminal half-life (t ½) ranging from 153 to 161 hours (~1 week) and a median time to reach maximum observed concentration (t max) ranging from 1 to 2 hours in healthy subjects. In multiple-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) trials, the exposure to oral semaglutide increased with increasing dose. Overall, the pharmacokinetic properties of semaglutide appeared similar in healthy subjects and in subjects with T2DM. Exposure to semaglutide exhibits a substantially greater dose-to-dose variation following oral administration compared to subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. However, when administered orally once-daily the PK properties of semaglutide, i.e. low clearance and long half-life, will limit the variation in exposure at steady state. Data obtained following investigation of different dosing conditions for oral semaglutide have demonstrated that subjects should take the oral semaglutide tablet in the morning in a fasting state and at least 30 minutes before the first meal of the day.

All tablets of oral semaglutide contain 300 mg of SNAC regardless of the semaglutide dose. SNAC is rapidly absorbed with a median t maxranging from 0.35 −0.5 hours in healthy subjects and from 0.52−1.43 hours in subjects with T2DM. It is extensively metabolised and no accumulation of SNAC has been observed in clinical trials. 3.1.5.2 Efficacy The efficacy of oral semaglutide in adult subjects with T2DM was investigated in a 26-week phase 2 dose-finding trial (NN9924-3790). In this trial, placebo or one of the following doses of oral semaglutide were administered once daily: 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg. Results from the trial showed that oral semaglutide effectively lowered glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) and body weight. Placebo-adjusted reductions in HbA 1cwere dose-dependent and statistically significant for all oral semaglutide treatment arms at week 26 (range: -0.40% to - 1.59%). Placebo-adjusted reductions in body weight were dose-dependent and statistically significant for oral semaglutide treatment doses of 10 mg and above at week 26 (range: -3.61 kg to - 6.98 kg). 3.1.5.3 Safety In the clinical trials completed so far, no unexpected safety findings have been identified for oral semaglutide administered up to 40 mg once daily.

In line with findings for other GLP-1 RAs, an increase in heart rate and serum levels of lipase and amylase has also been observed in subjects exposed to oral semaglutide. In addition to the 13 completed clinical trials with oral semaglutide, SNAC has been investigated in the programme of orally administrated heparin in combination with SNAC (heparin/SNAC). The heparin/SNAC programme included 29 phase 1 trials (SNAC doses ranged from 0.172-10.5 g). In three of these trials, SNAC alone was investigated (to a maximum dose of 10.5 g). The trials covered formulation development, food effect, hepatic and renal impairment, age-effect and drug-drug interaction. The programme also included a total of three phase 2 and 3 trials in which the effects of orally delivered heparin solution (with >1.5 g SNAC three times a day) was investigated. The overall safety profile of oral semaglutide and heparin/SNAC indicates that SNAC is safe and well-tolerated.

Oral semaglutide is the first GLP-1 RA in development in a tablet formulation and it has the potential of becoming a new attractive treatment option due to its effects on both hyper glycaemia and body weight. Insulin treatment in T2DM can be a very efficacious treatment, but in a number of patients optimal glycaemic control is not reached due to weight gain, risk of hypoglycaemia or reluctance to the increase insulin dose. The purpose of the present trial is to investigate whether combining oral semaglutide with insulin treatment may help patients with T2DM to reach glycaemic control as well as lead to weight loss or weight stabilisation.CONFIDENTIAL"

The trial will compare the efficacy and safety of three dose levels of once-daily oral semaglutide versus placebo in subjects with T2DM treated with insulin. Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1:1:1 manner to receive one of the following treatments: !3 mg oral semaglutide once-daily !7 mg oral semaglutide once-daily !14 mg oral semaglutide once-daily !oral semaglutide placebo once-daily Randomisation will be stratified based on: Descent: !Japanese subject !Non-Japanese subject Background metformin medication at screening: !Metformin !No metformin Background insulin medication at screening: !Basal insulin !Basal-bolus insulin alone !Premixed insulin including combinations of soluble insulins All tablets containing oral semaglutide or placebo are identical with regards to visual appearance to maintain the blinding of the trial. The total trial duration for the individual subject will be approximately 59 weeks. The trial includes a 2-week screening period followed by a 52-week randomised treatment period and a 5-week follow-up period. The 52-week randomised treatment period is split into two treatment periods; an initial 26-week fixed insulin treatment period where the insulin treatment is restricted, followed by a 26-week period where the insulin treatment is adjustable without any restrictions (see Section 5.3.3 ). The first 26 weeks of the trial is double-blinded. Because the week 26 trial results will be reported before the trial is completed, the randomisation details will be revealed to selected Novo Nordisk personnel after all subjects have completed 26 weeks treatment. Following the end of trial, results CONFIDENTIAL"

Investigators and subjects will be blinded throughout the entire trial. All subjects consent to the full trial length when they sign the informed consent. The trial design is illustrated in Figure 5–1. Figure 5–1 Trial design 5.2 Rationale for trial design The trial has been designed as a parallel-group, four-armed placebo-controlled trial to ensure a direct comparison between three dose levels of oral semaglutide and placebo. Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1:1:1 manner between the four treatment arms and the trial will be double- blinded for the initial 26 weeks. The randomisation will be stratified based on descent and background metformin medication and background insulin medication at screening (see Section 11.1). The stratification is to ensure an even distribution of the four treatment arms within strata. The confirmatory endpoints are defined after 26 weeks of treatment. This is considered sufficient time to compare the effect on glycaemic control and body weight after oral semaglutide dose escalation up till week 8 and insulin dose adjustments ending at week 16. Regarding insulin adjustment see section 5.3.3 and 5.5. Furthermore, at 26 weeks the extent of missing data, use of rescue medication or premature treatment discontinuation is expected to be limited. This allows for a robust estimation of the effect of oral semaglutide on HbA 1cand body weight. Supportive secondary efficacy endpoints defined at both 26 and 52 weeks will ensure capture of a number of relevant efficacy measures to support the primary results. The 5-week follow-up period is included to allow for wash-out of semaglutide. The total trial duration of 52 weeks of exposure to trial product will ensure adequate time to evaluate the long term safety of oral semaglutide in combination with insulin in subjects with T2DM.

Subjects randomised to the 7 and 14 mg treatment arms will continue treatment with 4-week dose- escalation step(s) until maintenance dose is reached, as illustrated in Table 5-1. To mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs, it is important to follow the fixed 4-week dose escalation intervals. The dose must not be changed during the course of the trial once the maintenance dose of oral semaglutide has been reached. Placebo treatment Subjects randomised to placebo will follow the same directions as outlined for the oral semaglutide treatment i.e. tablets administered orally once-daily. CONFIDENTIAL"

Trial product can be taken with up to half a glass of water (approximately 120 mL/4 fluid oz). The tablets must be swallowed whole by the subject and must not be broken or chewed (see Table 9-2 ). Furthermore, other oral medication can be taken 30 minutes after administration of the oral trial product. 5.3.2 Background medication In this trial, oral semaglutide or placebo will be added to an existing background medication of an insulin regimen alone or in combination with metformin treatment. After signing the informed consent, all subjects should continue their pre-trial insulin therapy (basal, basal-bolus or premixed regimen including combinations of soluble insulins) throughout the trial. For insulin treatment, see section 5.3.3.1. Subjects treated with metformin in addition to insulin treatment must continue their metformin treatment throughout the entire trial. Metformin treatment must be maintained at the stable, pre-trial dose and at the same frequency during the entire treatment period. If a subject has unacceptable hypoglycaemia during the course of the trial, the total daily insulin dose can be reduced at any time during the trial. However, the background medication may be adjusted if rescue medication is needed or a safety concern related to the background medication arises. In addition, all background medication (both metformin and insulin): !is considered to be non-investigational medicinal product (NIMP) !will not be provided by Novo Nordisk A/S, except if required by local regulations. !should be used in accordance with standard of care and current approved label in the individual country !must not exceed the maximum approved dose in the individual country 5.3.3 Total daily insulin dose adjustments during the trial The total daily insulin dose is the sum of all daily insulin doses (i.e. any basal, bolus and premixed insulin including combinations of soluble insulins) taken during the day. 5.3.3.1 At randomisation (V2) To minimise the risk of hypoglycaemic episodes when introducing an additional anti-diabetic agent, an initial 20% reduction in total daily insulin dose is recommended at randomisation for all subjects.

However, decreasing insulin doses before V5 to pre vent hypoglycaemia, is allowed. After a subject has reached the maintenance dose of oral semaglutide, the total daily insulin doses can be adjusted by the investigator from V5 until and including phone contact 9 (P9) by titration of either the basal insulin doses or doses of premixed insulin including combinations of soluble insulins according to the insulin titration guideline (5.3.3.4 ). Bolus insulin doses can be titrated at the investigators discretion. However, the total daily insulin doses should not be adjusted above the dose recorded at V2 (i.e. pre-randomisation dose). There are no restrictions on decreasing the insulin doses. After P9 the total daily insulin dose should remain fixed until V11, unless required to prevent acute diabetic complications or the subject has met rescue criteria (see Section 6.4). V11 is the concluding visit in the Restricted or fixed insulin treatment period as well the first visit in the Adjustable insulin treatment period. 5.3.3.3 During the adjustable insulin treatment period From V11 to end of trial there are no restrictions on adjustments of the total daily insulin dose. Thus, the total daily insulin dose can be adjusted by the investigator by either titration of the basal doses or doses of premixed insulin including combinations of soluble insulins according to the insulin titration guideline (section 5.3.3.4 ). Bolus insulin doses can be titrated at investigators discretion. 5.3.3.4 Insulin titration guideline Insulin titration should be based on the lowest of three self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values; preferably measured on three consecutive days prior to each phone contact/site visit and according to Table 5-2 and Table 5-3. The aim of the insulin titration should be to obtain a fasting plasma glucose level between 4.0 and 5.5 mmol/L (71-99 mg/dL) and an HbA 1clevel below 7.0% (53 mmol/mol).CONFIDENTIAL"

After discontinuation of trial product, GLP-1 RAs are not allowed before completion of the follow-up visit 5 weeks after the last date on trial product. Throughout the protocol, last date on trial product is defined as date of the subject’s last dosage of trial product. As this trial is a phase 3a trial, oral semaglutide will not be available for prescription until after marketing authorisation. 5.5 Rationale for treatment For oral semaglutide, the three dose levels (3, 7 and 14 mg), treatment initiation with the lowest dose and the 4-week dose escalation steps have been chosen based on data from the phase 2 dose- finding trial (NN9924-3790). This regimen is expected to have the optimal benefit-risk profile for further development for treatment of T2DM in the PIONEER programme. In one of the four arms, oral semaglutide will be dose escalated to the highest dose (14 mg) to investigate and establish the maximum efficacy and safety in subjects with T2DM treated with insulin alone or in combination with metformin. The present trial includes a placebo arm. The use of a placebo group is necessary to demonstrate that oral semaglutide together with non-pharmacological interventions such as diet, exercise and behaviour modifications are more effective than the same non-pharmacological interventions on their own. Specifically for this trial, glycaemic control in the placebo arm may also potentially be achieved by intensification of insulin treatment. Therefore, in order to estimate the true glucose lowering effect of oral semaglutide after 26 weeks, for all subjects, the insulin dose should be titrated with the restriction not to exceed the baseline total daily insulin dose and then be fixed CONFIDENTIAL"

The recommended 20% decrease in subjects’ total daily insulin dose at randomisation as well as the initial 8-week period during which insulin should not be increased are set to protect subjects randomised to active treatment arms against potential hypoglycaemic episodes. The insulin titration from visit V5 to P9 (weeks 8-16) is set to allow all subjects who may benefit from this, to get back to their pre-randomisation insulin dose-level. This will alleviate a possible hyperglycaemic effect of the initial insulin dose reduction in subjects randomised to the placebo arm. During the second trial period (from week 26 to end of trial) insulin treatment may be adjusted without restrictions in order to estimate the long term safety of adding oral semaglutide to freely adjustable insulin treatment.CONFIDENTIAL"

If any of the FPG values (including fasting SMPG) exceed the limits outlined below and no intercurrent cause of the hyperglycaemia can be identified, a confirmatory FPG (at central laboratory) should be obtained by calling the subject for a re-test. If the confirmatory FPG also exceeds the value described below, the subject should be offered rescue medication (i.e. intensification of anti- diabetic background medication and/or initiation of new anti-diabetic medication): !11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) from week 16 (P9) to end of treatment In addition, subject should be offered rescue medication if: !HbA 1c (at central laboratory) > 8.5% (69.4 mmol/mol) from week 26 (V11) to end of treatment It is important for trial integrity that only subjects actually needing treatment intensification (as defined above) are started on rescue medication. Subjects that are started on rescue medication should continue to follow the protocol-specified visit schedule. Rescue medication should be prescribed at the investigators’s discretion.

Background medication must be stable as changes in the background medication shortly before trial participation may potentially impact the trial interpretation. The HbA 1climits of 7.0-9.5% (53-80 mmol/mol) have been chosen to include subjects needing intensification of their anti-diabetic medication. The upper limit will ensure that subjects with severely uncontrolled T2DM are not enrolled in this placebo-controlled trial as the expected beneficial non-pharmacological effects merely from participation in the trial may not be sufficient in these individuals to justify inclusion. No BMI or blood pressure restrictions will be applied. Subjects with liver test abnormalities (ALT > 2.5 × UNL) will be excluded to avoid potential confounding of liver safety assessments. In addition, subjects with moderate, severe or end-stage renal impairment will be excluded in this trial, as the safety and efficacy of oral semaglutide in subjects with renal impairment are addressed in another dedicated phase 3a clinical trial. The eligibility criteria allow for enrolment of a trial population resembling the target population of T2DM patients treated with insulin in common practice. In addition, FPG and HbA1c will be monitored throughout the trial and rescue medication should be initiated in subjects with persistent, unacceptable hyperglycaemia.CONFIDENTIAL"

These are also included in the flow chart (see Section 2). Informed consent must be obtained before any trial related activity, see Section 18.2. Refer to flowchart (see Section 2) for number and timing of visits and specific assessments to be performed. Each subject will attend 12 site visits and 7 phone contacts. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that all site visits occur according to the flow chart. Planned visits can be conducted and re-scheduled within the allowed visit window. If a visit is missed and it is not possible to re-schedule, every effort should be made to ensure information is collected at a telephone contact (within the visit window) and entered into the eCRF. Subjects will be invited for the next scheduled visit according to the visit schedule. The investigator must keep a log of staff and a delegation of task(s) list at site. Investigator must sign the log of staff and the delegation of task(s) at site prior to the delegation of tasks. The investigator must keep a subject screening log, a subject identification code list and a subject enrolment log. Only subjects who have signed the informed consent form should be included on the logs. The subject screening log and subject enrolment log may be combined in one log. 8.1.1 Screening, visit 1 At screening, subjects will be provided with a card stating that they are participating in a trial and giving contact address(es) and telephone number(s) of relevant trial site staff. Subjects should be instructed to return the card to the investigator at the last trial visit or to destroy the card after the last visit. A screening session must be made in the IWRS. Each subject will be assigned a unique 6-digit subject number which will remain the same throughout the trial. Once all data relating to V1 have been obtained, these must be reviewed, dated and signed by the investigator and/or documented in medical records to assess that the subject is eligible to continue in the trial. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that the subject knows how to use the pen correctly.CONFIDENTIAL"

Serious adverse events (SAEs) from screening failures must be transcribed by the investigator into the eCRF. Follow-up on SAEs must be carried out according to Section 12. A screening failure session must be made in the IWRS. The case book must be signed . Re-screening is NOT allowed if the subject has failed one of the inclusion or exclusion criteria; this includes re-sampling if the subject has failed one of the inclusion or exclusion criteria related to laboratory parameters. However, in case laboratory samples are lost (e.g. haemolysed or displaced), re-sampling is allowed . 8.1.2 Fasting visits The subjects must attend several visits in a fasting state (see Section 2). Fasting for blood sampling is defined as no food or liquid within the last 8 hours prior to blood sampling, however water is allowed up until 2 hours prior to blood sampling. Trial product must be taken after blood sampling (see Section 5.3.1 for dosing instructions). Other oral medication can be taken 30 minutes after trial product. Injectable medications can be administered after blood sampling. In case a subject attends a fasting visit in a non-fasting state, all non-fasting measurements should be performed. The subject should return to the site in a fasting state to have the fasting blood samples done within the visit window for the relevant visit. Fasting samples: !fasting plasma glucose (FPG) !fasting lipid profile (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high- density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides) !semaglutide PK 8.1.3 Randomisation and trial product administration Eligible subjects will be randomised into one of four treatment arms. The randomisation session must be performed in the IWRS which will allocate the dispensing unit number (DUN) of trial product to be dispensed to the subject. All V2 assessments must be performed before administration of first dose of trial product. Trial products (see Section 9) will be dispensed to the subject by the site, hospital pharmacy or equivalent at each site visit during the trial from randomisation to last visit before the End-of-CONFIDENTIAL"

The investigator must document that subjects are trained in the dosing instructions at every dispensing visit, please see Section 5.3.1. Date of first administration of trial product will be captured in the eCRF. 8.1.4 End-of-treatment (visit 18) and Follow-up (visit 19) Subjects, who stay on trial product throughout the trial, must attend the End-of-treatment visit (V18) 52 weeks after randomisation and the Follow-up visit (V19) 5 weeks after the last date on trial product. V19 has a +3 days visit window. A completion call must be performed in the IWRS after completion of visit 18 (see Section 10). In case the subject cannot be reached (by clinic visit or phone contact) at the scheduled visit 19, the site should consult the contacts provided by the subject (e.g. close relatives), relevant physicians, medical records and locator agencies (if allowed according to local law) to collect health status. If no health status can be collected, the subject should be considered lost to follow up and this should be specified in the end-of-trial form. 8.1.5 Premature discontinuation of trial product and follow-up (visits 18A and 19A) Subjects, who discontinue trial product prematurely, should attend visit 18A scheduled to take place on the day of discontinuation of trial product (+ 3 days visit window). Visit 19A should be scheduled 5 weeks (+3 days visit window) after the last date on trial product. The primary reason for premature discontinuation of trial product must be specified in the end-of-trial form in the eCRF, and final drug accountability must be performed. A treatment discontinuation session must be made in the IWRS at visit 18A (see Section 10). If premature discontinuation of trial product is decided during a scheduled visit, the visit will be converted into a V18A and trial procedures must be performed accordingly. Subjects should continue with the originally scheduled site contacts after visit 19A and up to and including visit 19. If necessary, in order to retain the subject in the trial, site visits can be replaced by phone contacts after V19A. However, if a subject is unable or unwilling to attend all subsequent visit(s), the investigator should at least aim to have the subject attend V11 (week 26) and End-of- treatment (V18) (week 52) as these visits should be performed for all subjects, if at all possible (except subjects who withdraw informed consent, see Section 8.1.6 ). Subjects, who only agree to attend or provide health status at the planned V18, should not be considered withdrawn from the trial. In case the subject cannot be reached (by clinic visit or phone contact) at the scheduled V18, the site should consult the contacts provided by the subject (e.g. close relatives), relevant physicians, medical records and locator agencies (if allowed according to local law) to collect health status. If no health status can be collected, the subject should be considered lost to follow-up and this should be specified in the end-of-trial form. CONFIDENTIAL"

Only subjects who decline any further contact with the site in relation to the trial should be considered as withdrawn from the trial (for withdrawal procedures, see Section 8.1.6 ). 8.1.6 Withdrawals If a subject considers withdrawing from the trial, the investigator must aim to undertake procedures for visit 18A as soon as possible and visit 19A should be scheduled 5 weeks (+3 days visit window) after the last date on trial product, if the subject agrees to it. The end-of-trial form must be completed and final drug accountability must be performed even if the subject is not able to come to the trial site. A treatment discontinuation session must be made in the IWRS (see Section 10). The case book must be signed. Although a subject is not obliged to give his/her reason(s) for withdrawing consent, the investigator must make a reasonable effort to ascertain the reason(s), while fully respecting the subject’s rights. Where the reasons are obtained, the primary reason for withdrawing consent must be specified in the end-of-trial form in the eCRF. 8.1.7 Investigator assessments Review of diaries, Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs), laboratory reports, ECGs and fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy must be documented either on the documents or in the subject’s medical record. If clarification of entries or discrepancies in the diary or PROs is needed, the subject must be questioned and a conclusion made in the subject’s medical record. Care must be taken not to bias the subject. The documents must be retained at the site as source documentation. For ECGs, physical examinations and eye examinations, the evaluations must follow the categories: !Normal !Abnormal – Was the result clinically significant? (yes/no) The evaluation should be based on investigator’s judgement. For laboratory report values outside the reference range, the investigator must specify whether the value is clinically significant or not clinically significant.

The subject must attend these visits fasting (see Section 8.1.2 ). A central laboratory FPG result ≤ 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) in relation to planned fasting visits should not be reported as a hypoglycaemic episode but as a clinical laboratory adverse event (CLAE) at the discretion of the investigator (see Section 12.1.1 ). 8.3.2 Self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) At V1, subjects will be provided with a blood glucose meter (BG meter) including auxiliaries as well as instructions for use. The subjects will be instructed in how to use the device, and the instruction will be repeated as necessary duri ng the trial. In case a hypoglycaemic episode is suspected, the provided BG meter should be used for SMPG measurement. The BG meters use test strips calibrated to plasma values. Therefore, all measurements performed with capillary blood are automatically calibrated to plasma equivalent glucose values, which will be shown on the display . Only the BG meters provided by Novo Nordisk A/S should be used for the measurements required in the protocol. Subjects should be instructed in how to record the results of the SMPG values in the diaries. The record of each SMPG value should include date, time and value. All data from the diary must be transcribed into the eCRF during or following the contact. If obtained via phone and a discrepancy is later detected between the diary and the SMPG data obtained at the phone contact, the values in the eCRF must be corrected. Occasional review by the investigator of the values stored in the memory of the BG meter and correct reporting of these in the diary is advised in order to ensure adequacy of the data reported in the trial database. 8.3.2.1 Self-measured plasma glucose profile During the trial subjects should perform SMPG measurements for 3 consecutive days prior to selected site visits or phone contacts according to flowchart (see Section 2).

All PG values: !≤ 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or !> 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) occurring in conjunction with hypoglycaemic symptoms should be reported in the diary according to the instructions below throughout the trial from V 1 to V19. Upon onset of a hypoglycaemic epis ode the subject is recommended to measure PG every 15 minutes until the SMPG value is > 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) and/or symptoms have been resolved in accordance to current guidelines38. A SMPG value ≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or hypoglycaemic symptoms must trigger a hypoglycaemic episode form to be completed by the subject. Repeated SMPG measurements and/or symptoms will per default be considered as one hypoglycaemic episode until a succeeding SMPG value is > 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) and/or symptoms have been resolved. One hypoglycaemic episode form is to cover these measurements and/or symptoms In case of several low SMPG values within the hypoglycae mic episode, the lowest value is the one that will be reported as the SMPG value for th e hypoglycaemic episode but the start time of the episode will remain as the time for the first SMPG value and/or symptom. The record should include the following information: !Start date and time of the hypoglycaemic episode. !Stop date and time of the hypoglycaemic episode (stop time is the first time the PG value is > 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) and/or symptoms have been resolved). If a stop date and time is not reported, a hypoglycaemic episode will cover a period of 60 minutes. !The PG level before treating the episode (if available) and any follow up measurements. The lowest value measured during the hypoglycaemic episode will be reported as the PG value for the episode, the remaining values will be kept as source data in the diary. !Whether the episode was symptomatic (Yes/No). A hypoglycaemic episode starting without symptoms should be updated to symptomatic if the subject experiences symptoms later during the episode. !Whether the subject was able to treat him/herself. If the severity of a hypoglycaemic episode a ggravates, only one hypoglycaemic episode should be reported reflecting the most severe degr ee of hy pogly caemia.CONFIDENTIAL"

The subject must be questioned whether any of the low values were severe i.e. whether the subject was able to self-treat or not. If the subject was not able to self-treat it has to be reported as a severe hypoglycaemic episode on a hypoglycaemic episode form. Low SMPG values for non-severe hypoglycaemic episodes not having a hypoglycaemic episode form completed within 7 days since the SMPG measurement should be reported on a hypoglycaemic episode form with as much information as possible. Novo Nordisk will not query for additional data except for the start date, SMPG value and whether the subject was able to self- treat due to decreased validity of such data40, 41. The subject must be re-trained in how to report hypoglycaemic episodes if th e investigator identifies low SMPG values not reported as hypoglycaemic episodes. If the hypoglycaemic episode fulfils the criteria for an SAE then an AE form and a safety information form (SIF) must also be filled in, see Section 12. 8.5 Laboratory assessments The laboratory analyses will mainly be performed by a central laboratory. IgE anti-semaglutide antibodies and PK samples will be analysed by Novo Nordisk and a special laboratory (see Section 8.6.1 ). For some of the analyses related to suspicion of acute pancreatitis and hypersensitivity, a local laboratory must be used (see appendix B ). The handling, transportation and storage of biological samples are described in the laboratory manual (for central and special laboratory details see Attachment I). Samples will be coded in order to keep subject identity anonymous. Laboratory samples not drawn on the day of the actual visit should preferably be drawn on another day within the visit window stated in the flow chart (see Section 2). Please note that a laboratory sample pertaining to a specific visit must always be reported to that visit. For some of the samples drawn during the trial, subjects will be asked to attend the site visits fasting (fasting for blood sampling is defined in Section 8.1.2 ). The central laboratory will provide laboratory results to the investigator on an ongoing basis.

The semaglutide concentrations will be used for population PK analysis. The exact date and time for sampling the blood for PK analysis must be recorded on the lab requisition form. The date and time of the latest trial product administration prior to the visit must be recorded by the subject in the subject diary and transcribed to the eCRF by the investigator. Blood samples for PK assessments must be collected, handled and shipped according to the description in the laboratory manual supplied by the central laboratory (see attachment I). The special laboratory responsible for PK will be provided with the randomisation list and only samples from subjects treated with oral semaglutide will be analysed for semaglutide plasma concentrations.

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product. An AE includes: !A clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness. !A clinical laboratory adverse event (CLAE): a clinical laboratory abnormality which is clinically significant, i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, for example change of medicine dose or more frequent follow-up due to the abnormality. The following should not be reported as AEs: !Pre-existing conditions, including those found as a result of screening or other trial procedures performed before exposure to trial product (pre-existing conditions should be reported as medical history or concomitant illness). !Pre-planned procedures unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent. !Non-serious hypoglycaemia is an AE, but is reported on a hypoglycaemic episode form instead of on an AE form, see Section 8.4.8. The following three definitions are used when assessing an AE: !Severity –Mild – no or transient symptoms, no interference with the subject's daily activities. –Moderate – marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject' daily activities. –Severe – considerable interference with the subject's daily activities; unacceptable. !Causality Relationship between an AE and the relevant trial product (s): –Probable – Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship. –Possible – A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed.CONFIDENTIAL"

This term is only applicable if the subject has completed the trial or has died from another AE. –Recovered/resolved with sequelae – The subject has recovered from the condition, but with lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequela meets an SAE criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE. –Not recovered/not resolved – The condition of the subject has not improved and the symptoms are unchanged, or the outcome is not known. –Fatal – This term is only applicable if the subject died from a condition related to the reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a subject before he/she died should be assessed as “recovered/resolved”, “recovering/resolving”, “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or “not recovered/not resolved”. An AE with fatal outcome must be reported as an SAE. –Unknown – This term is only applicable if the subject is lost to follow-up. 12.1.2 Serious adverse event A serious adverse event (SAE) is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following: !Death. !A life-threateningaexperience. !In-patient hospitalisationbor prolongation of existing hospitalisation. !A persistent or significant disability or incapacityc. !A congenital anomaly or birth defect. !Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threateningaor require hospitalisationbmay be considered an SAE when - based on appropriate medical judgement - they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of SAEd. a.The term “life threatening” in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. b.The term “hospitalisation” is used when a subject: – Is admitted to a hospital or in-patient, irrespective of the duration of physical stay, or – Stays at the hospital for treatment or observation for more than 24 hoursCONFIDENTIAL"

This includes events occurring from the first trial-related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent until the end of the post-treatment follow-up period (V19) for subjects on trial product OR until the end of trial (V18 or V19A, whichever comes last) for the subjects who have discontinued trial product prematurely. Events for withdrawn subjects will be collected and reported until last trial related contact with the subject. The events must be recorded in the applicable eCRF forms in a timely manner, see timelines below and Figure 12–1. During each contact with the trial site staff, the subject must be asked about AEs and technical complaints, for example by asking: ""Have you experienced any problems since the last contact?"" All AEs, either observed by the investigator or subject, must be reported by the investigator and evaluated. All AEs must be recorded by the investigator in the eCRF AE form. The investigator should report the diagnosis, if available. If no diagnosis is available, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as individual AEs using separate AE forms in the eCRF. For SAEs, a safety information form (SIF) must be completed in addition to the AE form. A SIF is a form to collect supplementary clinical information. If several symptoms or diagnoses occur as part of the same clinical picture, one SIF can be used to describe all the SAEs. AEs requiring additional data collection must be reported using both the AE form and the specific event form. A specific event form is a form tailored to collect specific information related to the individual event. See appendix B for details about the events and the additional information to report. In case any of these events fulfil the criteria for seriousness in Section 12.1, then the event should be reported as serious. Some events will undergo event adjudication by the EAC, please refer to Section 12.7.2. For AEs qualifying for event adjudication, the adjudication form will also have to be completed in the eCRF. The adjudication form is a checklist of clinical data to be provided from the site.

Follow-up information must be reported to Novo Nordisk according to the following: !SAEs: All SAEs must be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovered/resolved”, “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or “fatal”, and until all queries have been resolved. Cases of chronic conditions, cancer or AEs ongoing at time of death (where death is due to another AE) may be closed with the outcome “recovering/resolving” or “not recovered/not resolved”. Cases can be closed with the outcome of “recovering/resolving” when the subject has completed the follow-up period and is expected by the investigator to recover. The SAE follow-up information should only include new (e.g. corrections or additional) information and must be reported within 24 hours of the investigator’s first knowledge of the information. This is also the case for previously non-serious AEs which subsequently become SAEs. !Non-serious AEs: Non-serious AEs must be followed until the outcome of the event is “recovering/resolving”, “recovered/resolved” or “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or until the end of the follow-up period stated in the protocol, whichever comes first, and until all queries related to these AEs have been resolved.

Cases can be closed with the outcome of “recovering/resolving” when the subject has completed the follow-up period and is expected by the investigator to recover. !Events for adjudication: If new information becomes available for events in scope of adjudication, this must be uploaded to the adjudication database in order for the EAC to evaluate if re-adjudication is needed. The investigator must ensure that the recording of the worst case severity and seriousness of an event is kept throughout the trial. A worsening of an unresolved AE must be reported as follow up with re-assessment of severity and/or seriousness of the event.

Any queries or follow-up requests from Novo Nordisk to non-serious AEs, SAEs and pregnancy forms must be responded to by the investigator within 14 calendar days from the date of receipt of the request, unless otherwise specified in the follow-up request. 12.6 Precautions and/or overdose There are no specific antidotes to semaglutide. Treatment of an overdose should be symptomatic. There is a potential risk of hypoglycaemia during dosing with semaglutide. The typical signs and symptoms of a non-severe hypoglycaemia include: hunger, slight headache, nausea, light- headedness, palpitations and sweating. Symptoms of non-severe hypoglyc aemia should be treated by ingestion of carbohydrates. Severe hypoglycaemia resulting in loss of consciousness should be treated according to best available medical practise. One case of accidental overdose of oral semaglutide was reported in the NN9924-3692 trial. The subject accidentally took the trial product and was thus treated with 20 mg of oral semaglutide. The subject did not report any symptoms and treatment was continued without any change. CONFIDENTIAL"

The validation is based on review of pre-defined clinical data related to the specific AE. Pre-defined clinical data consist of copies of source documents collected and delivered by the investigational sites. The EAC is composed of permanent members covering required medical specialities. EAC members must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and must be independent of Novo Nordisk. The events are reviewed by the EAC in a blinded manner. The EAC will have no authorisations to impact on trial conduct, trial protocol or amendments. The EAC works in accordance with written guidelines included in the EAC Charter describing in details the composition, tasks, responsibilities and work processes of the committee. The events outlined in Table 12-2 have been selected for adjudication in order to obtain an external independent validation of the diagnosis. In addition, cardiovascular events are being adjudicated according to FDA requirements51. The EAC will review copies in English (translated if necessary) of medical documentation received in the adjudication packages (e.g. x-ray, ECGs, ultrasound images, discharge summaries, pathology reports and death certificates). The investigator must provide medical documentation as soon as possible, when they receive the request from Novo Nordisk or the event adjudication vendor. CONFIDENTIAL"

During the course of the trial, the monitor will visit the trial site to ensure that the protocol is adhered to, that all issues have been recorded, to perform source data verification and to monitor drug accountability. The first monitoring visit will be performed as soon as possible after FSFV at the trial site and no later than 4 weeks after. The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the outcome of the remote monitoring of the eCRFs, the trial site's recruitment rate and the compliance of the trial site to the protocol and Good Clinical Practice (GCP), but will not exceed 12 weeks until LSLV at the trial site (for trial sites with active subjects (defined as subjects in screening, treatment or follow-up)). The monitor must be given direct access to all source documents (original documents, data and records). Direct access includes permission to examine, analyse, verify and reproduce any record(s) and report(s) that are important to the evaluation of the trial. If the electronic medical record does not have a visible audit trail, the investigator must provide the monitor with signed and dated printouts. In addition the relevant trial site staff should be available for discussions at monitoring visits and between monitoring visits (e.g. by telephone). All data must be verifiable in source documentation other than the eCRF. For all data recorded the source document must be defined in a source document agreement at each trial site. There must only be one source defined at any time for any data element. Source data generated by the trial site can be corrected by another person than the person entering the source data if accepted by local regulations; any correction must be explained, signed and dated by the person making the correction. The original of the completed diaries and/or PROs must not be removed from the trial site, unless they form part of the CRF and a copy is kept at the site. The monitor will ensure that the eCRFs are completed and that paper CRFs are collected. The following data will be source data verified for screening failures: !Date for obtaining informed consent. !Reason for screening failure Monitors will review the subject's medical records and other source data (e.g. the diaries and PROs) to ensure consistency and/or identify omissions compared to the eCRF. If discrepancies are found, the investigator must be questioned about these.CONFIDENTIAL"

The use and control of these systems are documented. Investigators working on the trial may use their own electronic systems to capture source data. 17 Statistical considerations There will be a partial database lock performed when all subjects have completed the first 26 weeks. After the entire 57 weeks a database lock will be performed. Data from the first 26 weeks will be reported separately before the entire trial is finalised. Data from the entire trial will be analysed and reported as a 57 week trial. General considerations If necessary, a statistical analysis plan may be written in addition to the protocol, including a more technical and detailed elaboration of the statistical analyses. The statistical analysis plan will be finalised before the partial database lock. The first 26 weeks of the trial is double-blinded. Because the week 26 trial results will be reported before the trial is completed, the randomisation details will be revealed to selected Novo Nordisk personnel after subjects have completed 26 weeks treatment. Following the end of trial, results from the entire trial period will be reported. Investigators and subjects will be blinded throughout the entire trial. Data from all sites will be analysed and reported together. In statistical analyses where stratification is included, the background metformin medication at screening (metformin/no metformin) and background insulin medication (basal insulin/basal-bolus insulin/premixed insulin including combinations of soluble insulins) will be included based on the actual information collected through the eCRF. In case of missing eCRF information the information collected from the IWRS system will be used. The information regarding descent (Japanese/non-Japanese) will be included based on country details from the IWRS. In the statistical analyses, stratification factors refer to the background metformin medication at screening and the background insulin medication at screening. Descent (Japanese/non-Japanese) will be included in the statistical analyses as part of region. The latest available measurement, at or prior to the randomisation visit, will be used as the baseline measurement. If no measurement(s) have been obtained, at or prior to randomisation, the baseline value will be left missing.CONFIDENTIAL"

Primary and secondary estimands Two estimands addressing different aspects of the trial objective will be defined; a primary de-facto (effectiveness) estimand and a secondary de-jure (efficacy) estimand: !Primary estimand – de-facto treatment difference at week 26 for all randomised subjects The primary de-facto estimand assesses the expected glycaemic benefit in a future population that results from subjects initiating treatment with oral semaglutide including potential rescue medication(s). Generalisation of this estimand depends among other things on the extent to which the use of rescue medication in this trial reflects clinical practice and the treatment adherence reflects the behaviour of the target population. Accordingly, data collected regardless of discontinuation of trial product or initiation of rescue medication(s) will be used to draw inference. !Secondary estimand – de-jure treatment difference at week 26 for all randomised subjects if all subjects adhered to treatment and did not initiate rescue medication The secondary de-jure estimand assesses the glycaemic benefit a future subject is expected to achieve if initiating and continuing treatment with oral semaglutide. It is considered a clinically relevant estimand as it provides information to treating clinicians about the expected glycaemic efficacy of oral semaglutide for purposes of treating individual subjects. Generalisation of this estimand depends among other things on the extent to which the adherence to trial product administration in this trial reflects the behaviour of the target population. Accordingly, only data collected prior to discontinuation of trial product or initiation of rescue medication will be used to draw inference. This will avoid confounding from rescue medication.CONFIDENTIAL"

Thus, missing data will mainly be due to withdrawal from trial or lost to follow- up. When estimating the secondary estimand, the proportion of subjects with missing data is expected to be higher (20%) since data collected after discontinuation of trial product or initiation of rescue medication(s) will be set to missing. The proportion of 20% is based on the oral semaglutide phase 2 trial (NN9924-3790), that indicates that a low starting dose with gradual dose escalation diminishes gastrointestinal AEs compared with more aggressive dosing regimens. Across treatment arms the main reasons for missing data are expected to be early treatment discontinuation due to gastrointestinal AEs and eventually initiation of rescue medication. Initiation of rescue medication is expected to be more frequent in the placebo arm and in the oral semaglutide 3 mg arm than for the two highest dose levels of oral semaglutide. A higher proportion of subjects are expected to discontinue treatment due to AEs in the oral semaglutide 14 mg arm, compared to the other treatment arms. So overall the frequency of missing data is expected to be similar across treatment arms. Descriptive summaries and graphical representation of extent, reason(s) for and pattern of missing data will be presented by treatment arm. 17.1 Sample size calculation Both the primary endpoint, change from baseline to week 26 in HbA 1cand the confirmatory secondary endpoint, change from baseline to week 26 in body weight are planned to be tested for superiority of oral semaglutide vs. placebo at each dose level (3 mg, 7 mg, and 14 mg). The sample size calculation is made to ensure a power of at least 90% to jointly confirm HbA 1c superiority of oral semaglutide vs. placebo at each dose level out of the six pre-specified confirmatory hypotheses shown in in Figure 17–1. The closed testing procedure described in Bretz et al.44is used to control the overall type I error at a nominal two-sided 5% level. The statistical testing strategy is built on the following two principles: !Within a dose level, glycaemic effect must be established in terms of HbA 1csuperiority before testing for added benefits in terms of body weight superiority. !Glycaemic effect in terms of HbA 1csuperiority must be established on all higher dose levels before continuing testing hypotheses on lower dose levels.CONFIDENTIAL"

All of the six pre-specified confirmatory tests are assumed to be independent. Since some of the tests are positively correlated, the assumption of independence is viewed as conservative. The sample size assumptions for treatment effects (TE), adjusted treatment effects and the standard deviations are given in Table 17-1. These are based on the oral semaglutide phase 2 results (NN9924-3790) and supported by results from the s.c. semaglutide phase 2 trial (NN9535-1821). Since the equalising effect of rescue medication will be included in the primary analysis as well as a conservative approach for handling of missing data will be performed, an adjustment in treatment effect will be implemented for the 10% of subjects who are expected to discontinue trial product or initiate rescue medication and for the 10% of subjects who are expected to have actual missing data. The treatment effects used in the sample size calculation will be adjusted according to a 75% smaller effect in these subjects. The adjusted treatment effects for testing superiority are defined as 0.8×TE + 0.2×TE×0.25.

The observation period is a subset of the in-trial observation period. It starts at the date of first dose of trial product. Two slightly different end dates will be needed to cover all assessments appropriately. For adjudicated events, ECGs and AEs including hypoglycaemic episodes, the observation period ends at the first date of any of the following: !The follow-up visit (V19) !The follow-up prematurely discontinuation visit (V19A) !The last date on trial product + 38 days !The end-date for the in-trial observation period The follow-up visit is scheduled to take place 5 weeks after the last date on trial product corresponding to approximately five half-lives of oral semaglutide. The visit window for the follow- up visit is + 3 days. For efficacy and other safety assessments (laboratory assessments, physical examination and vital signs) the observation period ends at the last date on trial product + 3 days. This will be used in order to ensure specificity to reversible effects of treatment. On-treatment without rescue medication: This observation period is a subset of the on-treatment observation period, where subjects are considered treated with trial product, but have not initiated any rescue medications. Specifically it starts at date of first dose of trial product and the end date is the first date of any of the following: !The last dose of trial product + 3 days !Initiation of rescue medication The in-trial observation period will be the primary observation period for estimating the primary estimand.

Confirmatory hypotheses For the primary HbA 1cendpoint and the confirmatory sec ondary body weight endpoint the following confirmatory one-sided hypotheses are planned to be tested at each dose level of oral semaglutide versus placebo. Let the mean treatment difference be defined as μ = (oral semaglutide minus placebo): !HbA 1csuperiority –H 0: μ ≥ 0.0 %-point against H A: μ < 0.0 %-point !Body weight superiority –H 0: μ ≥ 0.0 kg against H A: μ < 0.0 kg Operationally the hypotheses will be evaluated by two-sided tests at the 5% significance level. Multiplicity and criteria for confirming hypotheses The type I error for testing the six confirmatory hypotheses related to the HbA 1cand body weight endpoints will be preserved in the strong sense at 5% (two-sided) using the weighted Bonferroni-based closed testing procedure described in Bretz et al . 44and outlined in Figure 17–1. The first hypothesis to be tested is superiority of HbA 1cat the highest dose level. It will be tested at the overall significance level (5%) while allocating 0% local significance level to the remaining of the hypotheses. For this hypothesis, and in general, if a hypothesis is confirmed, then the significance level will be reallocated according to the weight and the direction of the edges going from the confirmed hypothesis to the next hypotheses as specified in Figure 17–1. Each of the following hypotheses will be tested at their updated local significance level ( α-local). This process will be repeated until no further hypotheses can be confirmed. Superiority will be considered confirmed if the mean treatment difference is supporting the corresponding alternative hypothesis and the two-sided p-value from the primary analysis of the primary estimand is strictly below its local two-sided significance level as defined by the closed testing procedure in Figure 17–1. This is equivalent to using a one-sided p-value (nominal α = 0.025) and a one-sided 2.5% overall significance level in the closed testing procedure. 17.3 Primary endpoint The primary endpoint is change from baseline to week 26 in HbA 1c.CONFIDENTIAL"

The primary statistical analysis will be a pattern mixture model using multiple imputation to handle missing data assuming that the missing data mechanism is missing at random (MAR) within the groups used for imputation. Imputation of missing data at week 26 will be done within 8 groups of subjects defined by randomised treatment arm, and whether subjects at week 26; (i) have discontinued treatment or initiated rescue medication or (ii) are still on treatment and have not initiated rescue medication. It is hereby assumed that the likely values of what the missing data would have been if available are best described by information from subjects who at week 26 are similar in terms of randomised treatment arm and treatment adherence/rescue medication status. Missing values for each group will be imputed as follows: !An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with region, stratification factors and the interaction between the stratification factors categorical fixed effects and baseline HbA 1cmeasurement as a covariate will be fitted to observed values of the change from baseline in HbA 1cat week 26. !The estimated parameters for location and dispersion will be used to impute 100 values for each subject with missing week 26 data based on region, stratification factors, the interaction between the stratification factors and baseline HbA 1c. Thus, 100 complete data sets will be generated including observed and imputed values. Analysis used for confirming superiority versus placebo at week 26: For each of the 100 (now complete) imputed data sets the change from baseline to week 26 in HbA 1cwill be analysed using an ANCOVA with treatment, stratification factors , the interaction between the stratification factors and region as categorical fixed effects and baseline HbA 1cas covariate. The results obtained from analysing the datasets will be combined using Rubin’s rule46to draw inference. From this analysis the estimated treatment differences between each of the oral semaglutide dose levels and placebo together with associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals and unadjusted two-sided p-values for testing no difference from zero will be presented. 17.3.2 Primary analysis for the secondary estimand The secondary estimand will be estimated based on the FAS using post-baseline measurements up to and including week 26 from the on-treatment without rescue medication observation period.

The independent effects included in the model will be treatment, stratification factors, the interaction between the stratification factors and region as categorical fixed effects and baseline HbA 1cas a covariate, all nested within visit. An unstructured covariance matrix for HbA 1c measurements within the same subject will be employed, assuming measurements from different subjects are independent. The MMRM is a well-established method that accounts for the uncertainty pertaining to missing data. This analysis assumes that the missing data mechanism is MAR. Under this assumption the statistical behaviour of the missing data (given the observed responses and model fixed effects and covariates) is assumed to be same as the observed data. 17.3.3 Sensitivity analyses To investigate the robustness of the primary analysis results, complementary and separate analyses will be performed for the primary and secondary estimand. In line with EMA recommendations 47 and with a report from the US National Research Counci l48, these analyses will primarily evaluate the sensitivity of the results due to the impact of missing data. The evaluation of the robustness of the primary analysis results will primarily be based on a pattern mixture model approach using multiple imputation. An overview of the sensitivity analyses for each of the estimands are specified below followed by a more detailed description of the three different pattern mixture models used. Finally, one additional sensitivity analysis for the primary analysis will be described that is not based on the pattern mixture model approach, see Section 17.3.3.2.

In effect this imputation approach removes the treatment difference between oral semaglutide and placebo for all subjects randomised to oral semaglutide, given that oral semaglutide is better than placebo. !Comparator multiple imputation analysis differentiating between reasons for discontinuing treatment prematurely: In this sensitivity analysis only missing data at week 26 for subjects who discontinue oral semaglutide treatment due to treatment related AEs will be imputed to resemble the distribution of the week 26 values observed in the placebo treatment arm. Treatment related AEs are defined as AEs classified as possible or probable related to trial product as reported by the investigator. In effect this imputation approach removes the treatment difference between oral semaglutide and placebo for this selected group of subjects randomised to oral semaglutide. !Tipping-point multiple imputation analysis: In this sensitivity analysis, missing data will first be imputed according to the primary analysis. Secondly, for all oral semaglutide treatment arms a penalty will be added to the imputed values at week 26. The approach is to gradually increase this penalty until all confirmed HbA 1cconclusions from the primary analysis are changed. For each hypothesis tested the specific value of the penalty that reverses the conclusion will be used to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis results. 17.3.3.2 Other sensitivity analyses The following additional sensitivity analysis will be specified:CONFIDENTIAL"

The change from baseline to week 26 in HbA 1cwill be analysed by a linear normal model (ANCOVA) with treatment, stratification factors, the interaction between the stratification factors and region as categorical fixed effects and baseline HbA 1cas a covariate. 17.3.3.3 Assessment of sensitivity analyses The results from the sensitivity analyses will be collectively used to interpret the robustness of the trial results for HbA 1c. Due to sensitivity analyses inherent conservative nature, it will not be a requirement that all confirmatory hypotheses are consistently confirmed across the sensitivity analyses. Thus, no absolute success criteria will be pre-defined for each sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity results in totality will be used to substantiate the credibility of the trial results. 17.4 Secondary endpoints 17.4.1 Confirmatory secondary endpoints Change from baseline to week 26 in body weight (kg) will be a confirmatory secondary endpoint. The primary and secondary estimands will be estimated using the same approaches as described for the primary HbA 1cendpoint. Baseline body weight will be used a covariate instead of baseline HbA 1cin both the multiple imputation and MMRM analysis models. Superiority will be considered confirmed if the mean treatment difference is supporting the corresponding hypothesis and the two-sided p-value from the analysis of the primary estimand is strictly below its local two-sided significance level resulting from the closed testing procedure in Figure 17–1. Sensitivity analyses similar to the ones pre-specified for the primary HbA1c endpoint will be made to evaluate the robustness of the body weight results. 17.4.2 Supportive secondary endpoints 17.4.2.1 Efficacy endpoints The below supportive secondary efficacy endpoints will be evaluated for: !The primary estimand based on FAS using the in-trial observation period !The secondary estimand based on FAS using the on-treatment without rescue medication observation period No sensitivity analyses are planned for these supportive secondary efficacy endpoints.

Fasting lipid profile endpoints will be log-transformed prior to analysis with the associated log-transformed baseline value as a covariate. For evaluation of the primary estimand the analyses will be performed separately for week 26 and week 52. For the analysis at week 52, the imputation of missing data will be further differentiated by whether subjects have discontinued treatment or initiated rescue medication prior to week 26 or at or after week 26. This will result in imputation of missing data within 16 groups of subjects instead of the 8 groups as described for the week 26 evaluation in Section 17.3.1. If less than five subjects have available data in one of the 16 groups, the imputation will be made within the 8 groups specified for the primary evaluation. The frequency of missing data is expected to be slightly larger at week 52 compared to week 26. The rate of missing data is expected to decline over time. For evaluation of the secondary estimand the MMRM based primary analysis will include all scheduled post-baseline measurement up to and including week 26 (or up to and including week 52 for change from baseline to week 52 endpoints). From this model the estimated treatment contrasts at week 26 (or at week 52 for change from baseline to week 52 endpoints) will be presented with 95% confidence intervals and two-sided p-values for test of no difference.CONFIDENTIAL"

Hypoglycaemic episodes are classified according to the Novo Nordisk classification of hypoglycaemia and the ADA classification of hypoglycaemia (see Figure 17–2 ). Novo Nordisk classification of hypoglycaemia In normal physiology, symptoms of hypoglycaemia occur below a PG level of 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL )49.

The sections below describe the important identified and potential risks and precautions associated with oral semaglutide treatment. These are based on findings in nonclinical studies and clinical trials with oral semaglutide as well as other GLP-1 RAs. For each of these risks and precautions, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial. Identified risks Gastrointestinal adverse events Consistent with findings with other GLP-1 RAs, the most frequently reported AEs in clinical trials with oral semaglutide have been gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia and constipation). Clinical trials have indicated that a low starting dose and gradual dose escalation mitigates the risk of gastrointestinal AEs. Consequently, a low starting dose and dose escalation with 4 week dose-escalation steps have been implemented in the trial. Potential risks Medullary thyroid cancer The human relevance of the proliferative C-cell changes found in rodents treated with GLP-1 RAs is unknown, but data suggest that rodents are more sensitive to the mode of action of GLP-1 RAs for induction of C-cell tumours. However, as a precaution, subjects with a family or personal history of MEN 2 or MTC will not be enrolled in the trial. During the trial, calcitonin will be measured on a regular basis, and the guidance for investigators on further evaluation and action on elevated calcitonin concentrations is included in appendix A. Acute pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported in subjects treated with GLP-1 RAs including oral semaglutide. As a precaution, subjects with a history of acute or chronic pancreatitis will not be enrolled in the trial. Also, subjects will be informed about the symptoms of acute pancreatitis and serum levels of lipase and amylase will be monitored throughout the trial. Pancreatic cancer Patients with T2DM have an increased risk of certain types of cancer such as pancreatic cancer. There is currently no support from nonclinical studies or clinical trials or post-marketing data that CONFIDENTIAL"

However, pancreatic cancer has been included as a separate potential risk due to the scientific debate surrounding a potential association to GLP-1-based therapies and the unknown long-term effects of stimulation of β-cells and suppression of α-cells. Pancreatic cancer has been classified as a potential class risk of GLP-1 RAs by EMA. Allergic reactions As in the case with all protein-based pharmaceuticals, treatment with oral semaglutide may evoke allergic reactions. These may include urticaria, rash, pruritus as well as anaphylactic reactions. As a precaution, subjects with known or suspected hypersensitivity to trial product(s) or related products will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, subjects will be instructed to contact the site staff as soon as possible for further guidance if suspicion of a hypersensitivity reaction to the trial product occurs. Hypoglycaemia Based on current knowledge about the GLP-1 RA drug class, there is a risk of hypoglycaemic episodes. Hypoglycaemic episodes have mainly been observed when a GLP-1 RA is combined with sulphonylurea or insulin. The risk for development of hypoglycaemia with oral semaglutide in combination with sulphonylurea and insulin is currently unknown. Acute renal impairment In subjects treated with GLP-1 RAs, including oral semaglutide, gastrointestinal AEs such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea may lead to significant dehydration and secondary acute renal impairment. Subjects with gastrointestinal AEs are recommended to drink plenty of fluids to avoid volume depletion. Also, serum creatinine and other markers of kidney function will be monitored throughout the trial. Impaired renal function may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis when GLP-1 RAs are co-administered with metformin. As a precaution, serum creatinine will be measured regularly. In subjects treated with metformin who experience prolonged or severe nausea and vomiting, the investigator should monitor serum creatinine, and if clinically indicated, withhold metformin until resolution of renal dysfunction. The use of the background medication should be in accordance with the current approved labels. Other safety considerations Diabetic retinopathy A transient worsening of diabetic retinopathy is a recognised complication in selected patients with diabetes after initiation of intensive antidiabetic treatmen t50,51,52. Risk factors for these events CONFIDENTIAL"

Several studies have, however, documented long-term beneficial effects of intensive glycaemic treatment in reducing retinopathy progression53,54even in intensively treated patients who experienced early worsening51. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial with s.c. semaglutide, results indicate an increased risk of events related to diabetic retinopathy in subjects treated with semaglutide compared to placebo. As a precaution in this trial, all subjects are required to have a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy performed before enrolment into the trial; moreover, subjects with proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring acute treatment will be excluded. Teratogenicity (embryo-foetal development toxicity) Semaglutide caused embryo-foetal malformations in the rat through a GLP-1 receptor mediated effect on the inverted yolk sac placenta leading to impaired nutrient supply to the developing embryo. Primates do not have an inverted yolk sac placenta which makes this mechanism unlikely to be of relevance to humans. However, as a precaution, females who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become pregnant or are of childbearing potential and not using an adequate contraceptive method will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, pregnancy tests will be performed at all visits, including screening and follow-up and at any time during the trial if a menstrual period is missed, or as required by local law. General precautions All subjects will be included after a thorough evaluation with regards to in- and exclusion criteria defined in order to ensure that subjects are eligible for trial treatment. There are also strict glyacemic rescue criteria in place to ensure acceptable glycaemic control during the trial. If rescue medication is required, it should be in accordance with ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes21, 22(excluding GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors, amylin analogues and SGLT-2 inhibitors). It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure the best possible care according to the principles outlined in Diabetes Care 2016 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes 55. Further details with regards to safety of oral semaglutide are described in the current edition of the IB for oral semaglutide (NN9924), or any updates thereto. 18.1.1 Benefits In this trial subjects will be randomised to one of four treatment arms involving a treatment regimen anticipated to be equally or more efficacious than the treatment they receive at the time of trial entry. Based on the results of the phase 2 dose finding trial, oral semaglutide is expected to provide clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control and body weight in subjects with Type 2 diabetes.CONFIDENTIAL"

All subjects in this trial will receive trial products and auxiliary supplies free of charge. 18.1.2 Risk and benefit conclusion The safety profile for oral semaglutide generated from the clinical and nonclinical development programme has not revealed any safety issues that would prohibit administration of oral semaglutide in accordance with the planned clinical trial. The phase 2 results indicate that oral semaglutide will provide clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control and body weight. Safety and efficacy will be monitored regularly and acceptable glycaemic control will be reinforced at all times during the trial. In conclusion, the potential risk to the subjects in this trial is considered low and acceptable in view of the anticipated benefits oral semaglutide would provide to subjects with T2DM. 18.2 Informed consent In seeking and documenting informed consent, the investigator must comply with applicable regulatory requirement(s) and adhere to ICH GCP1and the requirements in the Declaration of Helsink i2 Before any trial-related activity, the investigator must give the subject verbal and written information about the trial and the procedures involved in a form that the subject can read and understand.

Close surveillance of subject retention will be performed throughout the trial by Novo Nordisk with focus on reasons for premature discontinuation of trial product or withdrawal of consent to secure early mitigations in collaboration with the trial sites. The investigator will make every effort to ensure that all assessments are performed and data is collected. If missing data does occur the reason will be collected via the protocol deviation process, see Section 19.1. Novo Nordisk will monitor protocol deviations on an on-going basis throughout the trial followed by appropriate actions (e.g. re-training of site staff).CONFIDENTIAL"

If any tasks are delegated, the investigator must maintain a log of appropriately qualified persons to whom he/she has delegated specified trial- related duties. The investigator must ensure that there is adequate and documented training for all staff participating in the conduct of the trial. It is the investigator’s responsibility to supervise the conduct of the trial and to protect the rights, safety, and well-being of the subjects. A qualified physician, who is an investigator or a sub-investigator for the trial, must be responsible for all trial-related medical decisions. The investigator will follow instructions from Novo Nordisk when processing data. The investigator is responsible for filing essential documents (i.e. those documents which individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a trial and the quality of the data produced) in the investigator trial master file. The documents including the subject identification code list must be kept in a secure locked facility, so no unauthorized persons can get access to the data. The investigator will take all necessary technical and organisational safety measures to prevent accidental or wrongful destruction, loss or deterioration of data. The investigator will prevent any unauthorised access to data or any other processing of data against applicable law. The investigator must be able to provide the necessary information or otherwise demonstrate to Novo Nordisk that such technical and organisational safety measures have been taken. During any period of unavailability, the investigator must delegate responsibility for medical care of subjects to a specific qualified physician who will be readily available to subjects during that time. If the investigator is no longer able to fulfil the role as investigator (e.g. if he/she moves or retires), a new investigator will be appointed in consultation with Novo Nordisk. The investigator and other site personnel must have sufficient English skills according to their assigned task(s).CONFIDENTIAL"

All information supplied by Novo Nordisk in connection with this trial shall remain the sole property of Novo Nordisk and is to be considered confidential information. No confidential information shall be disclosed to others without prior written consent from Novo Nordisk. Such information shall not be used except in the performance of this trial. The information obtained during this trial may be made available to other physicians who are conducting other clinical trials with the trial product, if deemed necessary by Novo Nordisk. Provided that certain conditions are fulfilled, Novo Nordisk may grant access to information obtained during this trial to researchers who require access for research projects studying the same disease and/or trial product studied in this trial. Novo Nordisk may publish on its clinical trials website a redacted clinical trial report for this trial. One or two investigators will be appointed by Novo Nordisk to review and sign the clinical trial report (signatory investigator) on behalf of all participating investigators. The signatory investigator(s) will be appointed based upon the criteria defined by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors for research publications56. 23.1 Communication of results Novo Nordisk commits to communicating, and otherwise making available for public disclosure, results of trials regardless of outcome. Public disclosure includes publication of a paper in a scientific journal, abstract submission with a poster or oral presentation at a scientific meeting, or disclosure by other means. The results of this trial will be subject to public disclosure on external web sites according to international and national regulations, as reflected in the Novo Nordisk Code of Conduct for Clinical Trial Disclosure23. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to defer the release of data until specified milestones are reached, for example when the clinical trial report is available. This includes the right not to release the results of interim analyses, because the release of such information may influence the results of the entire trial. At the end of the trial, one or more scientific publications may be prepared collaboratively by the investigator(s) and Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to postpone publication and/or communication for up to 60 days to protect intellectual property.CONFIDENTIAL"

All authors will be given the relevant statistical tables, figures, and reports needed to evaluate the planned publication. In the event of any disagreement on the content of any publication, both the investigators’ and Novo Nordisk opinions will be fairly and sufficiently represented in the publication. Where required by the journal, the investigator from each trial site will be named in an acknowledgement or in the supplementary material, as specified by the journal. Novo Nordisk maintains the right to be informed of plans by any investigator to publish and to review any scientific paper, presentation, communication or other information concerning the investigation described in this protocol. Any such communication must be submitted in writing to Novo Nordisk before submission for comments. Comments will be given within four weeks from receipt of the planned communication. 23.1.1 Authorship Authorship of publications should be in accordance with the Uniform Requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors56(sometimes referred to as the Vancouver Criteria). Novo Nordisk will appoint investigator(s) to prepare publications in collaboration with Novo Nordisk. 23.1.2 Site-specific publication(s) by investigator(s) For a multi-centre clinical trial, analyses based on single-site data usually have significant statistical limitations and frequently do not provide meaningful information for healthcare professionals or subjects, and therefore may not be supported by Novo Nordisk. It is a Novo Nordisk policy that such individual reports do not precede the primary manuscript and should always reference the primary manuscript of the trial. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to prior review of such publications. Further to allow for the primary manuscript to be published as the first, Novo Nordisk asks for deferment of publication of individual site results until the primary manuscript is accepted for publication. As Novo Nordisk wants to live up to the industry publication policy, submission of a primary publication will take place no later than 18 months after trial completion. 23.2 Investigator access to data and review of results As owner of the trial database, Novo Nordisk has the discretion to determine who will have access to the database. Individual investigators will have their own research subjects' data, and will be provided with the randomisation code after results are available.CONFIDENTIAL"

The investigator must agree to archive the documentation (this includes both electronic and paper- based records) pertaining to the trial in an archive after completion or discontinuation of the trial if not otherwise notified. The investigator should not destroy any documents without prior permission from Novo Nordisk. If the investigator cannot archive the documents at the trial site, Novo Nordisk can refer the investigator to an independent archive provider that has a system in place to allow only the investigator to access the files. The investigator must be able to access his/her trial documents without involving Novo Nordisk in any way. Site-specific CRFs and other subject data (in an electronic readable format or as paper copies or prints) will be provided to the investigator before access is revoked to the systems and/or electronic devices supplied by Novo Nordisk. These data must be retained by the trial site. If the provided data (e.g. the CD-ROM) is not readable during the entire storage period, the investigator can request a new copy. A copy of all data will be stored by Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk will maintain Novo Nordisk documentation pertaining to the trial for at least 20 years after discontinuation of the marketing authorisation, termination of the trial or cancellation of the research project whichever is longest. The files from the trial site/institution must be retained for 15 years after end of trial as defined in Section 7, or longer if required by local regulations or Novo Nordisk. In any case trial files cannot be destroyed until the trial site/institution is notified by Novo Nordisk. The deletion process must ensure confidentiality of data and must be done in accordance with local regulatory requirements. CONFIDENTIAL"

The human relevance of this finding is unknown. However, based on the findings in rodents, monitoring of serum calcitonin (a sensitive biomarker for C-cell activation) is currently being performed in clinical trials with semaglutide. While there is general agreement on the clinical interpretation of substantially elevated calcitonin levels (greater than 100 ng/L) as likely indicative of C-cell neoplasia, the interpretation of values between upper normal range (5.0 and 8.4 ng/L for women and men, respectively) and 100 ng/L is less clear with regards to indication of disease. There are several known confounding factors affecting calcitonin levels, e.g.: !renal dysfunction !smoking !autoimmune thyroiditis !several drug classes (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, beta-blockers, H 2-blockers and glucocorticoids) Physiology of C-cell activation in various clinical conditions and in different patient populations (i.e. with various co-morbidities) is poorly understood. There may be various clinical conditions not identified so far which mildly or moderately affect calcitonin secretion by C-cells.CONFIDENTIAL"

The subject should remain in the trial, however, all medications suspected to relate to this condition must be discontinued until diagnosis has been established. Background: These values were found in 9 (0.15%) of a population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease1.All of these patients were diagnosed with medullary thyroid carcinoma resulting in a positive predictive value of 100 %. Diagnostic evaluation should include: !thyroid ultrasound examination !fine needle aspiration of any nodules > 1 cm !potentially surgery with neck dissection In case a subject is diagnosed with medullary thyroid carcinoma, it is common clinical practice to explore the family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia and perform a genetic test for RET proto-oncogene mutation. 2.2 Calcitonin ≥ 50 and < 100 ng/L Action: The subject should be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation. The subject should remain in the trial and continuation on trial product should be based on the evaluation done by the thyroid specialist. Background: These values were found in 8 (0.14%) of the population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease1.Two of these subjects were diagnosed with MTC and two were diagnosed with C-cell hyperplasia, resulting in a positive predictive value of a C-cell anomaly of 50%. Diagnostic evaluation should include: !thyroid ultrasound examination !if available and there are no contraindication, a pentagastrin stimulation test should be done. For subjects with positive pentagastrin stimulation test, surgery should be considered. !if pentagastrin stimulation test is not available, thyroid ultrasound and fine needle aspiration biopsy may add important clinical information about the need for surgery. 2.3 Calcitonin ≥ 10 and < 50 ng/L Action: The subject can continue in the trial on trial product. Continue sampling of calcitonin according to the protocol. If the value is from the last sample taken in the trial, the subject should be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation.CONFIDENTIAL"

The predictive value of a C-cell anomaly for this calcitonin level was 8.3%. However, the likelihood of having a medullary carcinoma >1 cm with calcitonin in this range is extremely low. For calcitonin values between 10-20 ng/L Costante et a l1identified 216 (3.7%) patients. One patient out of the 216 had a subsequent basal (unstimulated) calcitonin of 33 ng/L, and had C-cell hyperplasia at surgery. Two other studies used a cut-off of calcitonin > 10 ng/L to screen for C-cell disease, but they do not provide sufficient information on patients with basal calcitonin > 10 and < 20 ng/L to allow conclusions2,3.CONFIDENTIAL"

The onset of the pain may be swift reaching maximum intensity within 30 min, it is frequently unbearable and characteristically persists for more than 24 hours without relief1. The pain is often associated with nausea and vomiting. Physical examination usually reveals severe upper abdominal tenderness at times associated with guarding. In general, both amylase and lipase are elevated during the course of acute pancreatitis. The serum lipase may remain elevated slightly longer than amylase. The level of the serum amylase and/or lipase does not correlate with the severity of acute pancreatitis 1. In general, serum lipase is thought to be more sensitive and specific than serum amylase in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. In case of suspicion of acute pancreatitis, the trial product should promptly be interrupted (no treatment discontinuation call should be made in the interactive web response system (IWRS) before diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed). Appropriate additional examinations must be performed, including local measurement of amylase and lipase. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires two of the following three features2: !abdominal pain consistent with acute pancreatitis (acute onset of a persistent, severe, epigastric pain often radiating to the back) !serum lipase activity (and/or amylase activity) at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal !characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on imaging. If acute pancreatitis is ruled out, trial product should be re-initiated.If acute pancreatitis is confirmed, appropriate treatment and careful monitoring of the subject should be initiated.

Additional eye examinations and additional data collection on diabetic retinopathy 2. Investigator’s responsibility in ensuring evaluation and management of certain risk factors and complications 3. Clarification of the criteria for completion, withdrawal and lost to follow-up 4. Week 26 reporting of trial results 5. Other minor corrections and clarifications 1.1 Additional eye examinations and additional data collection on diabetic retinopathy Updated protocol Sections: 2, 4.2.2.4, 8.4.1.2, 8.4.4, 12.1.5, 17.2, 17.4.2.2, 18.1 and Appendix B. Transient worsening of diabetic retinopathy is a recognised complication in selected patients with diabetes after initiation of intensive antidiabetic treatment50,51,52. Risk factors for these events include long-standing poor glycaemic control and presence of proliferative retinopathy, and initial large improvements in blood glucose may be an additional aggravating factor. In a recently completed cardiovascular outcomes trial with s.c. semaglutide, results indicate an increased risk of events related to diabetic retinopathy in subjects treated with semaglutide compared to placebo ref x1. The majority of the related adverse events were moderate in severity and did not lead to premature discontinuation of trial product. , additional eye examinations have been implemented in all trials in the PIONEER programme. Also, to further understand this safety signal, additional information will be collected for all diabetic retinopathy events reported during the trial. The information will be collected not only from new subjects enrolled by the time of this amendment, but also from already enrolled subjects to the extent that the information is available. Furthermore, information to the investigators and subjects related to diabetic retinopathy has been added to the protocol (see Section 18) and the subject information. 1.2 Investigator’s responsibility in ensuring evaluation and management of certain risk factors and complications Updated protocol Section: 8.4.2, 8.4.4 and 18.1. , text is added to highlight the investigator’s responsibility in relation to further evaluation of potential incidental thyroid nodules discovered at the physical examination. In addition, text is added to highlight the investigator’s responsibility in ensuring evaluation and management of cardiovascular risk factors and microvascular complications such as diabetic kidney disease and diabetic retinopathy.CONFIDENTIAL"

The criteria for subject completion, -withdrawal and -lost to follow-up respectively are clarified and have been made consistent across sections. Lost to follow-up is considered a subcategory to withdrawal from trial. In addition, it is emphasised that as soon as contact to a subject is lost, efforts must be made to regain contact and the efforts must continue until the subject’s last planned visit. Only if contact is not regained at that time point can the subject be considered lost to follow up. Because this trial is not an outcome trial the terminology ‘health status’ is replaced with ‘relevant safety information‘ - the purpose of which is to follow up on any adverse events or pregnancy, and not to determine if a subject completes the trial or not. 1.4 Week 26 reporting of trial results Updated protocol sub-title and Sections: 1, 5.1, 5.2 and 17. The protocol is revised to reflect that Novo Nordisk will not report data from the first 26 weeks of the trial in a separate interim clinical trial report (CTR). The trial will be blinded for investigators, subjects and Novo Nordisk throughout the trial. 1.5 Clarification of insulin titration guideline Updated protocol Section: 5.3.3.4. The protocol section on insulin titration is updated to accommodate guidance regarding subjects who may be included in the trial on a three times daily premixed insulin regimen. Also a minor revision of the wording regarding subjects on a basal and bolus insulin regimen is done. Furthermore, wording is added to the end of the section to underline that in the interest of subject safety, clinical judgement must always overrule the protocol titration guidelines if deemed necessary by the investigator. 1.6 Other minor adjustments, clarifications and correction of typographical errors 1.6.1 Physical examination Updated protocol sub-title and Sections: 2, 4.2.2.4 and 17.4.2.2. Physical examination will be performed at week 52 only. 1.6.2 Phrasing of background insulin medication Updated protocol Sections: 5.1, 5.3.3.4, 11 and 17 and Protocol metadata template for consistency with inclusion criteria no. 5.CONFIDENTIAL"

Because the week 26 trial results will be reported before the trial is completed, the randomisation details will be revealed to selected Novo Nordisk personnel after all subjects have completed 26 weeks treatment. Following the end of trial, results from the entire trial period will be reported. Investigators and subjects will be blinded throughout the entire trial. All subjects consent to the full trial length when they sign the informed consent. 2.6 Section 5.2 Rationale for trial design The trial has been designed as a parallel-group, four-armed placebo-controlled trial to ensure a direct comparison between three dose levels of oral semaglutide and placebo. Subjects will be randomised in a 1:1:1:1 manner between the four treatment arms and the trial will be double- blinded throughout the trial for the initial 26 weeks. The randomisation will be stratified based on descent and background metformin medication and background insulin medication at screening (see Section 11.1). The stratification is to ensure an even distribution of the four treatment arms within strata. 2.7 Section 5.3.3.4 Insulin titration guideline Insulin titration should be based on the lowest of three self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) values; preferably measured on three consecutive days prior to each phone contact/site visit and according to Table 5-2 and Table 5-3. The aim of the insulin titration should be to obtain a fasting plasma glucose level between 4.0 and 5.5 mmol/L (71-99 mg/dL) and an HbA 1clevel below 7.0% (53 mmol/mol). In addition: !For subjects on once-daily basal insulin or once-daily premixed insulin including combinations of soluble insulins regimens, titration should be based on the lowest of three fasting pre- breakfast SMPG values taken after at least 6 hours of fasting. !For subjects on twice-daily basal or twice-daily premixed insulin including combinations of soluble insulins regimens, titration should be done for each dos eing separately: oThe morning or lunch dose should be titrated based on the lowest of three pre-dinner SMPG values oThe evening dose should be based on the lowest of three fasting pre-breakfast fasting SMPG values !For subjects on a regimen of three times daily premixed insulin including combinations of soluble insulins, titration should be done for each dose separately: oThe morning dose and the lunch dose should be titrated based on the lowest of three pre-dinner SMPG values and, at the discretion of the investigator, possibly additional measurements. For documentation purposes the prescribed morning and lunch doses should be recorded in the eCRF as the sum of each.CONFIDENTIAL"

It is recognised that the treatment differs between regions and countries. Likewise, specific guidelines are not applicable in certain clinical situations. It is therefore important that other information, such as symptoms of hypoglycaemia and /hyperglycaemia, previous response to dose adjustments and other indicators of the subject’s level of glycaemic control, is taken into consideration when decisions on dose changes are made. Clinical judgement has to be applied to avoid increased risk to the subject’s safety and must always overrule guidelines when deemed necessary by the investigator. 2.8 Section 6.6 Withdrawal from trial The subject may withdraw consent at will at any time. The subject’s request to withdraw from the trial must always be respected. Only subjects who withdraw consent should be considered as withdrawn from trial. A subject who does not complete the trial is also considered withdrawn from the trial. Hence, a subject is considered withdrawn if the following applies: !!Subject withdrew consent !Subject is lost to follow up (only to be used if there is no contact with the subject by the time of the subject’s last scheduled visit, see sections 8.1.4 - 8.1.6.1) !Other (subject deceased or closure of trial site) 2.9 Section 8.1.4 End-of-treatment (visit 18) and Follow-up (visit 19) At V18, the subject should be reminded about the importance of attending the follow-up visit (V19). If the subject, nonetheless, does not attend V19, the site should make efforts to obtain contact with the subject within the visit window. A trial completer is defined as a subject who attends, or is in contact with the site, at the subject’s last scheduled visit. For subjects who complete treatment, the last scheduled visit is V19. (For subjects who discontinue trial product, see Section 8.1.5) In case the subject cannot be reached (by clinic visit or phone contact) at the scheduled visit 19, the site should consult the contacts provided by the subject (e.g. close relatives), relevant physicians, medical records and locator agencies (if allowed according to local law) to collect health status. If no health status can be collected, the subject should be considered lost to follow up and this should be specified in the end-of-trial form.CONFIDENTIAL"

If necessary, in order to retain the subject in the trial, site visits can be replaced by phone contacts after V1 89A. However, if a subject is unable or unwilling to attend all subsequent visit(s), the investigator should at least aim to have the subject attend V11 (week 26) and End-of-treatment (V18) (week 52) as these visits should be performed for all subjects, if at all possible (except subjects who withdraw informed consent, see Section 8.1.6). Subjects, who only agree to attend or provide health status at the planned V18, should not be considered withdrawn from the trial. In case the subject cannot be reached (by clinic visit or phone contact) at the scheduled V18, the site should consult the contacts provided by the subject (e.g. close relatives), relevant physicians, medical records and locator agencies (if allowed according to local law) to collect health status. If no health status can be collected, the subject should be considered lost to follow-up and this should be specified in the end-of-trial form. A subject who prematurely discontinued trial product is still considered a trial completer if the subject attends or is in contact with the site, at the subject’s last scheduled visit. For subjects who prematurely discontinue trial product, the last scheduled visit is V18 (or V19A if it is scheduled after V18). The site should in due time prepare for establishing contact with the subject within the visit window of the scheduled V11 and V18, respectively, if the subject has agreed to attend these visits. In summary, subjects should stay in the trial irrespective of lack of adherence to randomised treatment, lack of adherence to visit schedule, missing assessments or trial product discontinuation for any reason. Only subjects who decline any further contact with the site in relation to the trial should be considered as having withdrawn informed consent from the trial (for withdrawal procedures, see Section 8.1.6). 2.11 Section 8.1.6.1 Lost to follow-up In case contact to the subject is lost during the trial, the site should immediately undertake efforts to re-establish contact. If the subject cannot be reached (by clinic visit or phone contact) and the subject has consented to it, the site should consult the contacts provided by the subject (e.g. close relatives), relevant physicians, medical records and locator agencies (if allowed according to local law) in an attempt to regain contact with the subject or to obtain relevant safety information from other sources. Efforts to regain contact should continue until the end of the subject’s last scheduled visit: V19 for subjects who have completed treatment, whereas for subjects who have discontinued trial product prematurely the last visit is V18 (or V19A if it is scheduled after V18). Only if contact with the subject is not regained by the end of the visit window of the last scheduled visit can the subject be considered lost to follow up (see Section 6.6). CONFIDENTIAL"

For the analysis at week 52, the imputation of missing data will be further differentiated by whether subjects have discontinued treatment or initiated rescue medication prior to week 26 or at/or after week 26. This will result in imputation of missing data within 12 16 groups of subjects instead of the 8 groups as described for the week 26 evaluation in Section 17.3.1. If less than five subjects have available data in one of the 12 16 groups, the imputation will be made within the 8 groups specified for the primary evaluation. The frequency of missing data is expected to be slightly larger at week 52 compared to week 26. The rate of missing data is expected to decline over time. ! !Multiple imputed data sets (100 1000 ) will be created in which missing values for the underlying continuous assessments are imputed by treatment group and treatment adherence/rescue status assuming MAR and as described in Section 17.3.1 for the primary estimand and by treatment group assuming MAR and as described in Section 17.3.2 for the secondary estimand !The binary endpoint will be created for each of the 100 1000 complete data sets !Each of the created complete data set will be analysed with the logistic model and inference will be drawn using Rubin’s rule46. 2.23 Section 17.4.2.2 Safety endpoints Other safety endpoints Change from baseline to week 26 and week 52 in: !Haematology !Biochemistry (except for amylase and lipase) !Calcitonin !ECG evaluation !Physical examination ( week 52 only) !Eye examination category (week 52 only)CONFIDENTIAL"

Risk factors for these events include long-standing poor glycaemic control and presence of proliferative retinopathy, and initial large improvements in blood glucose may be an additional aggravating factor. Several studies have, however, documented long-term beneficial effects of intensive glycaemic treatment in reducing retinopathy progression 53,54even in intensively treated patients who experienced early worsening51. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial with s.c. semaglutide, results indicate an increased risk of events related to diabetic retinopathy in subjects treated with semaglutide compared to placeboRefx1. As a precaution in this trial, all subjects are required to have a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy performed before enrolment into the trial; moreover, subjects with proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring acute treatment will be excluded. As part of good diabetes management, the investigator is encouraged to ensure adequate monitoring and treatment of diabetic retinopathy in subjects enrolled into the trial Ref x2. General precautions All subjects will be included after a thorough evaluation with regards to in- and exclusion criteria defined in order to ensure that subjects are eligible for trial treatment. There are also strict glyacemic a-related rescue criteria in place to ensure acceptable glycaemic control during the trial. If rescue medication is required, it should be in accordance with ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes guidelines (excluding GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors and, amylin analogues and SGLT-2 inhibitors). It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure the best possible care of the subject. This includes adequate glycaemic control, appropriate risk factor modification such as optimal treatment of hypertension, dyslipidaemia and other cardiovascular risk factors, as well as regular monitoring and treatment of diabetic kidney disease and diabetic retinopathy (according to the principles outlined in Diabetes Care 2016 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes )Refx2. 2.25 Section 27 References Reference numbers will change throughout the updated protocol when new references above are introduced.CONFIDENTIAL"
