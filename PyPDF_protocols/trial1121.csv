BACKGROUND 1.1 OVERVIEW XBiotech USA, Inc. has developed a True Human monoclonal antibody, bermekimab , that binds the cytokine IL -1α with high affinity and is an effective blocker of IL -1α biological activity. IL - 1α is a key mediator of sterile inflammatory responses and has been implicated in the pathology of advanced cancer, cardiovascular disease, and rheumatologic disease. Clinical evidence generated to date suggests that targeting IL -1α may be an effective treatment in undermining the inflammatory process that drives a wide array of diseases, including dermatologic conditions. The active ingredient in the drug product is bermekimab , a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human interleukin- 1α (IL-1α). The entire bermekimab heavy and light chain sequences are identical to those found in naturally -occurring human IgG1 κ, with the light and heavy chain variable regions being identical to those originally expressed by a per ipheral blood B lymphocyte that was obtained from a healthy individual. No in vitro affinity maturation or modifications have been made to improve its natural binding affinity (211 +/ - 31 pM). We believe that a true human antibody should be effectively non- immunogenic in humans and thus exhibit optimal activity and pharmacokinetics. XBiotech has conducted 10 clinical studies to date using the bermekimab antibody. These studies have been conducted in a wide range of therapeutic areas, from cancer to health y volunteers, and have included a several different dose levels and dosing schedules. Both intravenous and subcutaneous formulations have been explored for safety and evidence of efficacy. Three phase 2 studies sponsored by XBiotech have been completed in dermatologic indications (acne, psoriasis, pyoderma gangrenosum), as well as one investigator sponsored study in Hidradenitis Suppurativa1,2,3. Subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis experienced a rapid reduction in their psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), and subjects with acne vulgaris experienced reductions of inflammatory lesion counts, as well as reduced hospital anxiety and depression scores (HADS). In both of these trials, there were few adverse events, which were all grade 1 (mild) and the only events that appeared to be related to therapy were mild injection site reactions in two patients. The investigator initiated study e nrolled patients with moderate to severe HS that were refractory to adalimumab. The study was double blind, randomized and placebo controlled, and utilized the"

Ten patients were randomized to placebo and 10 patients to treatment with bermekiamb . A positive HiSCR score after 12 weeks was found in one (10%) and six (60%) patients respectively (OR: 13.50; 95%CIs: 1.19- 152.61; p: 0.035). After withdrawal of therapy at week 12, a positive HiSCR score was found in nil (0%) and four (40%) patients after 24 weeks (p: 0.043). Endogenous anti -IL-1α antibodies are present in 5% to 28% of the general population4,5,6,7. No negative correlations with disease have been noted for these individuals. To the contrary, the presence of natural anti -IL-1α antibodies has been associated with favorable outcomes, both with respect to rheumatoid arthritis and ischemic heart disease. Animal studies also indicate that IL -1α loss or antagonism does not result in harm. Moreover, the well -tolerated use of other approved biological agents that employ other strategies to block IL -1 activity suggest that bermekimab ’s targeting of IL -1α repr esents a safe treatment approach. 1.2 RATIONALE Atopic dermatitis (AD) is an inflammatory skin disease affecting as much as 20% of the population in western industrial societies. Chronic eczema in AD and associated pruritus can be a significant cause of morbidity and impact life quality. Disease pathogenesis is complex but ultimately converges on a pathological inflammatory process that disrupts the protective barrier function of the skin. The prototypical inflammatory cytokine interleukin -1 alpha (IL -1⍺) plays a key role in the pathophysiology of a wide range of inflammatory skin disorders8. Bermekimab is a natural human antibody that exhibits immunoregulatory activity through blocking IL -1⍺ activity. Keratinocytes are a major reservoir of IL -1⍺ and may be a key source of inflammatory stimulus in AD. IL -1⍺ is present on leukocytes, where its role in leukocyte trafficking and infiltration may represent a key step in the chronic inflammation of AD. IL -1⍺ is a key inducer of matrix metalloproteinase s activity which could be directly involved in the epithelial barrier breakdown in AD9. Loss of regulation of IL-1 results in systemic inflammation with extensive skin involvement10. In previous dermatology studies bermekimab was well tolerated and showed impressive therapeutic activity. Dose ranging of the subcutaneous formulation of bermekimab is now being studied in a 6 week open label treatment regimen for AD in order to establish the basis for further randomized studies."

INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 2.1 ACTIVE INGREDIENT, PHARMACOLOGIC CLASS, STRUCTURE The active ingredient in the drug product is bermekimab , a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human interleukin- 1α (IL-1α). The entire bermekimab heavy and light chain sequences are identical to those found in naturally -occurring human IgG1 κ, with the light and heavy chain variable regions being identical to those originally expressed by a peripheral blood B lymphocyte that was obtained from a heal thy individual. Figure 2.1: Bermekimab Antibody The bermekimab primary glycoform has a molecular weight of 148.1 kilodaltons. Like all IgG1 molecules, the heavy chains are joined at their hinge regions through two disulfide linkages, and each heavy ch ain is joined to one light chain through one disulfide linkage between their CH 1 and CL domains respectively. The main isoform has a pI of about 9.2 and comprises about 70- 80% of the total isoform population in all lots that have been manufactured to date, as determined by capillary isoelectric focusing. The heavy chain CH 2 domains are glycosylated primarily with the oligosaccharide structure shown in Figure 2.1, as determined by mass spectroscopy of the cleaved glycans. The glycosylated residue (Asn -302 a s numbered from the N -terminus of bermekimab ) has been determined by peptide mapping to be in the same highly conserved N -linked glycosylation site as found in endogenous IgG1 (Asn -297 according to the generic numbering system). Similarly, the primary glyc an, commonly referred to as G0F, is the same as that found on about 22% of endogenous human IgG molecules11. The entire bermekimab heavy and light chain sequences are identical to those found in naturally- occurring human IgG1 κ, with the light and heavy chain variable regions being identical to those originally expressed by a peripheral blood B lymphocyte that was obtained from a healthy individual."
14,page_14,"XBIOTECH USA INC. PROTOCOL 2018- PT044 Version 3.0 CONFIDENTIAL 22 August 2018 PAGE 15 of 52 Endogenous anti -IL-1α antibody has been reported in 5% to 28% of healthy serum or plasma samples12,13. It has been measured in cord blood, children and adults14. The anti-IL-1α antibodies measured in human plasma have been strictly of the IgG class, particularly IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4. Relatively equal distribution is seen in male and f emale plasma15. Binding affinities reported for endogenous anti -IL-1α antibodies, ranging from 4 to 16 pM, are comparable to that for bermekimab , the specification for which is 22 to 260 pM. It is important to point out that affinity maturation had already taken place in the human host, and therefore no in vitro affinity maturation was required to increase the natural binding affinity of bermekimab . Also important is the fact that, unlike most other therapeutic IgG products, for which the Fc regions are derived from a rare human allele, XBiotech’s product includes a heavy chain in which the constant (CH) region represents an allele found in approximately 70% of the human population. These two f eatures should make for a drug product with reduced potential for immunogenicity. 2.2 DRUG PRODUCT ( BERMEKIMAB 100 MG/ML) DESCRIPT ION XBiotech’s dosage form is a sterile liquid formulation of 100 mg/mL bermekimab in a stabilizing isotonic subcutaneous formulation buffer at pH 6.2- 6.5.

PROTOCOL 2018- PT044 Version 3.0 CONFIDENTIAL 22 August 2018 PAGE 17 of 52 2.5 STABILITY The drug product is formulated in a buffer in which most of the tonicity comes from trehalose rather than salt. Trehalose is an effecti ve stabilizer against oxidation and aggregation, as well as thermal and mechanical stress. Citrate was selected as the buffering agent due to its antioxidant properties. Extensive stability data indicates that the drug product is very stable , even under thermally and mechanica lly stressed conditions. Short excursions to room temperature have shown no negative effect on the product. However, the study treatment products are not to be frozen at any time. The 100 mg/ml and 200 mg/ml drug product is labeled with a 12-month retest date. Every lot of both the 100/200mg/ml dosage forms is also subjected to ongoing stability analysis per ICH guidelines. 2.6 METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION The dose of bermekimab for Group A is 200 mg (2ml of the 100 mg/ml formulation) and for Group B is 400 mg (2ml of the 200 mg/ml formulation) administered weekly by subcutaneous injection. * 45-60 minutes prior to injection, remove the pre -filled syringe from refrigeration and allow it to naturally warm to room temperature before injection.

STUDY DESIGN AND OBJECTIVES Phase 2, open label, dose escalation study of two dose cohorts of bermekima b in patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. The study is multicenter, and will consist of two dose levels: Bermekimab administered subcutaneously at a dose of 200 mg weekly (4 doses) and bermekimab administered subcutaneous ly at a dose of 400 mg weekly (8 doses). Patients taking the 200mg dose will be followed for 5 weeks (6 visits , day 35 +/-2), and patients taking the 400mg dose will be followed for 8 weeks (9 visits, day 56 +/-2) to allow for assessment of safety and preliminary efficacy . Dose escalation details can be found in Section 5.3. The protocol of the study will be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or the Ethics Committee (EC) of the participating study sites. Depending on the participating countries , both local and central IRB/EC approvals will be granted. The study will be registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov before the enrollment of the first patient. T he trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements."

The total EASI score shall be in a range (from 0 to 72 po ints ( from no disease to maximum disease severity, respectively ). • Patients (%) achieving Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Response (0 or 1) at Visit 8 IGA assesses disease severity and clinical response using a 5 -point scale : 0 = clear; 1 = almost clear; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = severe. The score is determined by ranking the extent of erythema and papulation/infiltration. A clinical response to therapy will be an IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). Patients receiving more than one treatment with additional medication to treat AD exacerbation during the study or missing IGA scores at Visit 8 will be treated as non -responders. • Patients (%) achieving ≥2 IGA Score Reduction at Visit 8 • Pharmacokinetics (PK) Assessment An enzyme -linked i mmunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed to specifically measure b ermekimab levels in human plasma. Blood will be drawn into a single 6 ml Na -Heparin collection tube at each PK collection time point (sample collection is pre-dose at visit 1, visit 3, visit 5 , and visit 8). These samples will be collected per the study lab manual and immediately shipped to the Sponsor for PK analysis. The PK samples will also be used to test for the presence of antibodies against bermekimab . • Change (%) for peak weekly averaged pruritus numerical rating scores (NRS) from baseline to visit 8 1. The NRS rating system captures the intensity of patient’s itch and pain over a 24- hour period. The following question will be presented to patients: “how would a participant rate his or her itch at the worst moment and on average during the previous 24 hours (scale 0 - 10 [0 = no itch; 10 = worst possible itch] )?” and “ how would you rate your pain on average during the previous 24 hours [0 = no pain ; 10 = severe pain ])?"

It includes assessment of the eczema in addition to patient reported symptoms. Total score ranges from 0 to 103 (no disease to most severe disease, respectively). • Patients (%) achieving 50% or greater reduction in EASI Score from baseline to Visit 8 • Patients (%) achieving 50% or greater reduction in SCORAD Score to Visit 8 • Change (%) in Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) Scores from baseline to Visit 8 POEM is a 7 -item is a patient reported quality of life outcome measure based on a questionnaire to determine disease symptoms, including bleeding, cracking, dryness, flaking, itching, sleep loss and weeping. The scoring range is from 0 to 28 (no disease to most severe disease, respecti vely). • Changes in Global Individual Signs Score (GISS) from baseline to visit 8 • Change from baseline to visit 8 in Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) • Change (%) from pre - and post - injection of Visit 1 Quest ionnaire for pruritus, pain and erythema GISS assesses AD lesions for erythema, excoriations, lichenification and edema/papulation. Each component will be rated on a global basis (over the entire body surface rather t han by region) using a 4- point scale (0=none, 1=mild, 2=moderate and 3=severe) according to the EASI grading severity.

Characteristics of the patient ’s atopic dermatitis, including duration of disease, baseline EASI score (including individual signs score), baseline Investigator’s Global Assessm ent, baseline body surface area involvement, baseline pruritus numerical rating score, baseline SCORAD score, baseline patient oriented eczema measure, baseline DLQI, and baseline HADS score, will be collected. Baseline is defined as the visit 1 pre -injec tion assessment. 8.2 S TUDY ENDPOINT DEFINITIONS Eczema Area and Severity Index The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD. Four AD disease characteristics will be assessed for severity by the investigator or designee on a scale of “0” (absent) through “3” (sev ere). In addition, the area of AD involvement will be assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk, arms, and legs and converted to a score of 0 to 6. Pharmacokinetic Assessment An enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed to specifically measure bermekimab levels in human plasma. Blood will be drawn into a single 6 ml Na-Heparin collection tube at each PK collection time point (sample collection is pre-dose at visit 1, visit 3, visit 5, and visit 8). These samples will be collected per the study lab manual and immediately shipped to the Sponsor for PK analysis. The PK samples will also be used to test for the presence of antibodies against bermekimab . Investigator’s Global Assessment The IGA is an assessment scale used in clinical studies to determine severity of AD and clinical response to treatment based on a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). Global Individual Signs Score Individual components of the A D lesions (erythema, edema /papulation, excoriations, and lichenification) will be rated globally (ie, each assessed for the whole body, not by anatomical region) on a 4- point scale (from 0=none to 3=severe) using the EASI severity grading criteria."

PROTOCOL 2018- PT044 Version 3.0 CONFIDENTIAL 22 August 2018 PAGE 37 of 52 SCORing Atopic Dermatitis The SCORAD is a validated tool used in clinical research and clinical practice that was developed to standardize the evaluation of the extent and severity of AD. There are 3 components to the assessment: A = extent or affected body surface area, B = intensity , and C = subjective symptoms. The extent of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area and reported as the sum of all areas, with a maximum score of 100% (assigned as “A” in the overall SCORAD calculation). The intensity of 6 specific symptoms of AD (redness, swelling, oozing/crusting, excoriation, skin thickening/ lichenification, dryness) is assessed using the following scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of 18 total points, assig ned as “B” in the overall SCORAD calculation). Subjective assessment of itch and sleeplessness is recorded for each symptom by the patient or relative on a VAS, where 0 is no itch (or sleeplessness) and 10 is the worst imaginable itch (or sleeplessness), w ith a maximum possible score of 20. This parameter is assigned as “C” in the overall SCORAD calculation. The SCORAD is calculated as: A/5 + 7B/2 + C where the maximum is 103. Patient Assessment of Pruritus and Pain The NRS is a simple assessment tool that patients will use to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch) and pain during a daily recall period using a study diary. Patients will be asked to complete the following questions: • For average itch intensity: “On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being ‘no itch’ and 10 being the ‘worst itch imaginable’, how would you rate your itch on average during the previous 24 hours?” • For maximum itch intensity: “On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being ‘no itch’ and 10 being the ‘worst itch imaginable’, how would you ra te your itch at the worst moment during the previous 24 hours?” • For pain intensity: “ On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being ‘no pain’ and 10 being the ‘ most severe pain ’, how would you rate your pain on average during the previous 24 hours? ” Patients will be instructed to record their NRS score daily from day 0 to day 56 (+/-2). Sites will be expected to review the diary at each visit and enter the data from the previous 7 days . Visit 1 Questionnaire for Pruritus, Pain and Erythema The following questions assess the intensity of pruritus (itch) and pain experienced by the patient before and after the injection of bermekimab during visit 1 . The patient will answer the following questions :"

On a scale of 0 to 10, what is the current intensity of itch, with 0 being ‘no itch’ and 10 be ing the ‘worst itch imaginable’. 2. On a scale of 0 to 10, what is the current intensity of pain, with 0 being ‘no pain’ and 10 being ‘severe pain’. The Investigator will assess the patient’s Erythema and complete the following on the Visit 1 Questionnaire : 3. What is the current status of the patient’s erythema overall? a. None◻ Mild ◻ Moderate ◻ Severe ◻ b. Please describe area(s) and degree(s) of the patient’s erythema in detail and if applicable any post -injection changes observed . The Visit 1 Questionnaire will be performed twice: 1. Visit 1 , pre-injection of bermekimab ; 2. Visit 1 , sixty minutes post -injection of bermekimab . Patient Oriented Eczema Measure The POEM is a 7 -item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess disease symptoms in children and adults. The format is a response to 7 items (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping) based on frequency during the past week (ie, 0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = every day ) with a scoring system of 0 to 28; the total score reflects disease- related morbidity. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale The HADS is an instrument for screening anxiety and depression in non- psychiatric populations; repeated administration also provides information about changes to a patient’s emotional state. The HADS consists of 14 items, 7 each for anxiety and depression symp toms; possible scores range from 0 to 21 for each subscale. The following cut -off scores are recommended for both subscales: 7 to 8 for possible presence, 10 to 11 for probable presence, and 14 to 15 for severe anxiety or depression. Dermatology Life Qua lity Index The DLQI is a 10 -item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the impact of AD disease symptoms and treatment on QOL. The format is a simple response (0 to 3 where 0 is “not at all” and 3 is “very much”) to 10 quest ions, which assess QOL over the past week, with an overall scoring system of 0 to 30; a high score is indicative of a poor QOL."

ADVERSE EVENTS 9.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERS E EVENT (AE) An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship with the pharmaceutical or biological agent under study. An AE can therefore be any of the following : • Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including laborato ry findings), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of bermekimab , whether or not it is apparently related to bermekimab • A concurrent illness • An exacerbation, or an unexpected increase in frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition, including intermittent or episodic conditions. However, anticipated day -to-day fluctuations or expected progression of the preexisting condition (based upon the Investigator’s clinical judgment) are not to be considered AEs • A significant or unexpected wor sening of the condition/indication under investigation. However, anticipated day -to-day fluctuations or expected progression of the disease under investigation (based upon the Investigator’s clinical judgment) are not to be considered AEs • A suspected inte raction between the investigational drug and concomitant medications • Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality (including radiological interpretations, histopathological findings, etc .) 9.2 DEFINITION OF SERIOU S ADVERSE EVENT (SAE ) A serious adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that meets any of the following criteria : • Results in death • Life-threatening • Requires or pro longs inpatient hospitalization • Results in a persi stent or significant disability • Congeni tal anomaly/birth defect • An important medical event that, while it may not result in death or be immediately life - threatening or require/prolong hospitalization, may jeopardize the subject and/or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of t he outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic"

PROTOCOL 2018- PT044 Version 3.0 CONFIDENTIAL 22 August 2018 PAGE 40 of 52 bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Note that seriousness and severity should not be confused. A subject could experience a severe headache that would not qualify as an SAE, while another might experience a mild stroke that, while not severe, would be considered serious. 9.3 RECORDING OF ADVERSE EVENTS All AEs and SAEs must be recorded on the case report form (CRF)/eCRF and in the patient’s source document s occurring between visit 1 (post-injection) and visit 9 (or if subject terminates from study prior to visit 9, seven days after the last administration of bermekimab) . All AEs should be recorded in standard medical terminology as concisely as possible. The AE recorded should not be a procedure or a clinical/laboratory measurement but should reflect the event leading to the procedur e or the cause of the clinical/laboratory abnormality, if known. Whenever possible, AEs should be evaluated and recorded as a diagnosis, rather than individual signs and symptoms. However , if a definitive diagnosis is not possible, the individual signs a nd symptoms should be recorded. Any AE that worsens in intensity, or becomes serious, should be recorded as a new event. 9.4 EVALUATING ADVERSE E VENTS All AEs will be graded according to the CTCAE version 4.03. 9.5 ASSESSMENT OF CAUSAL ITY Investigators are required to assess the relationship, if any, of each AE or SAE to the investigational drug using clinical judgment to determine the degree of certainty with which an AE can be attributed to the investigational drug. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying disease, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the administration of the study medication must be considered. Relationship to study drug is summarized as follows: • Not Related: There is another obviou s cause of the AE • Unlikely to be related: There is another more likely cause of the AE • Possibly related: The AE could have been due to the investigational drug • Probably related: The AE is probably attributable to the investigational drug"

PROTOCOL 2018- PT044 Version 3.0 CONFIDENTIAL 22 August 2018 PAGE 41 of 52 • Definitely rela ted: The AE is most likely attributable to the investigational drug 9.6 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS Any AE (with the exception of worsening AD symptoms or injection site reactions) of grade 2 or higher must be entered into the eCRF within 24 hours of learning of the event. Any grade 3 or greater injection site reaction must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the event . All serious adverse events (SAEs) should be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. These immediate reports should be followed promptly by detailed, written reports. The subject should be followed up with until stabilization of the reported SAE, either with full satisfactory resolution or resolution with sequelae, or until death of the subject. Before declaring the subject is lost to follow -up, three unsuccessful attempts at contact should be made and recorded on the SAE form . The immediate and follow -up reports should identify subjects by unique code numbers assigne d to the trial subjects rather than by the subjects' names, personal identification numbers, and/or addresses. The Investigator should also submit SAEs to the IRB /EC according to their IRB /EC guidelines [ICH -GCP E6]. Drug -related Serious Adverse Events wi ll be reported to the FDA by XBiotech’s Medical Safety Officer according to 21 CFR 312.32. 9.7 REFERENCE SAFETY INF ORMATION: POTENTIAL ADVERSE REACTIONS 831 patients have been treated using bermekimab in patients with advanced solid tumors, advanced hematologic malignancies, metastatic colorectal cancer, peripheral vascular disease, type II diabetes, acne vulgaris, plaque psoriasis, and pyoderma gangrenosum. Over 1200 doses of bermekimab were administ ered at 7.5 mg/kg to refractory, metastatic CRC patients with cancer associated symptoms at baseline (ECOG performance status 1 and 2). In this trial (PT026), which is the largest controlled trial completed with bermekimab to date (N=309), patients were dosed at 7.5 mg/kg for metastatic colorectal cancer. The most common AEs reported (>10%) were abdominal pain, peripheral edema, fatigue, anemia, constipation, decrease in weight, asthenia, decreased appetite, and nausea. The majority of these events were grade 1 or 2 and appeared to be related to the underlying CRC. The prevalence of these events was similar in the bermekimab and placebo groups. Two infusion reactions were reported in this trial, and they were not serious or severe (grade I or II)."
41,page_41,"XBIOTECH USA INC. PROTOCOL 2018- PT044 Version 3.0 CONFIDENTIAL 22 August 2018 PAGE 42 of 52 Bermekimab is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human interleukin- 1α (IL-1α). As such, it is an immunomodulator that has anti -inflammatory and anti -neoplastic properties. Other agents that could be considered in the same pharmacolo gic class include biologic agents that target IL -1 receptor antagonist and IL -1 beta. Potential risks for agents in this class include infusion or injection site reactions , particularly with respect to IL -1ra, although in this case is likely related to th e unanticipated agonist effects of the receptor antagonist when it is present in high local concentration at the site of injection and thus this effect is not relevant to bermekimab . Bermekimab is human monoclonal antibody derived immune plasma B cells d erived from a natural human immune response against IL -1a. Unlike previous generations of humanized or fully human antibodies, the entire bermekimab heavy and light chain sequences are identical to those found in naturally -occurring human IgG1 κ, with the light and heavy chain variable regions being identical to those originally expressed by a peripheral blood B lymphocyte that was obtained from a healthy individual. No in vitro affinity maturation or modifications have been made to improve its natural binding affinity (211 +/ - 31 pM). We believe that a true human antibody should be effectively non- immunogenic in humans and thus exhibit optimal activity and pharmacokinetics. To date, no treatment emergent anti -drug antibodies specific to b ermek imab have been identified. The mechanism behind infusion reactions is not clear in all cases. It may involve a reactio n against the antibody , against excipients in the preparation such as polysorbate, or against some minor residual component from the manufacturing process (i.e. host cell proteins). To date, there has been a very low incidence of mild injection site or infusion reactions observed (20 patients out of 831 total; 2.4%). All except two of these patients had grade 1 or 2 reactions that did not result in discontinuation. In order to mitigate this class- specific risk, close monitoring is required during the bermekimab infusion and for a t least 1 hour after infusion. Availability of resuscitation equipment must be ensured. Pre -medication with antihistamines or corticosteroids is not required. For the purposes of expedited safety reporting in clinical trials, the following should be considered expected events: • Infusion Related Reactions • Injection Site Reactions"
