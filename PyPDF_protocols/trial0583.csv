STGG product not being available, it has been decided to replace it with cry obeads for storage of bacterial isolates. PCR testing on samples stored in cry obeads was shown to be as efficient as for samples stored in STGG. Besides, this decision has been taken for alignment with other COPD studies, where STGG solutions are no longer used. Clarification of technique used for target identification. For the primary endpoint, various viral pathogens will be identified but not quanti fied. Along this line, the wording “and b y HRV quantitative RT -PCR” has been removed from primary endpoint to avoid confu sion as H RV viral load data will be reported as part of the tertiary endpoints. Clarification in exclusion criteria section (4.3). Administration of antibiotics before stud y entry , wher e study entry is meant to be Visit 1. Clarification in study procedure section ( 6.3) and in the section for recording current medication (6.4.2.10) during scheduled visits, where it has been specified that recording of an y current medication is applicable for an y disease not only COPD -related. Moreover, a footnote referring to Table 1 0 “Reporting period for SAE and AEs leading to withdrawal” has been added for further clarification, both in Table 4 and 5. Addition of a section (actual 6.4.2.6) for Pregnancy test for Visit 1, Visit 2 and Visit 3. A Pregnancy test section for Screening V isit was included during Protocol Amendment 1: to be consistent, same wording has been included for the subsequent visits. Clarification of reporting of severe AE COPD s. Two sentences have been added in sections 7.1.1 and 7.2.2.1 for making clear that sever e AECOPD events are not to be reported as SAE as they are meant as disease -related outcomes. Rewording in the table concerning reporting period for SAE and AEs leading to withdrawal for better clarification (Table 10). Addition of a new outsourced laborato ry (DDL). To correct some t ypographical errors.

Rationale for the studyBecause the infectious aetiology of AECOPD has been suggested to vary according to geographical region, the primary purpose of this study (which will be con ducted in several countries in Asia Pacific) is to evaluate the occurrence of potential bacterial and viral pathogens in the sputum of stable COPD patients and at the time of AECOPD. Given the increasing and projected burden of COPD in the Asia Pacific region, this study will also evaluate the frequency , severit y and duration of AECOPD, as well as the impact of AECOPD on health- related quality of life (HRQOL), healthcare utilisation and lung function. In addition, both PCR and bacteriological methods will b e used for characterisation (quantification in some cases) of bacteria in sputum. To date, identification of bacteria and assessment of bacterial load is done in the vast majority of cases b y culture. However, the few studies that have compared culture with PCR demonstrated that PCR is more discriminatory at detecting t ypical airway bacteria [Curran, 2007; Singh 2014 . Moreover, in a multi -centre study , PCR has the advantage that it can be performed on stored sputum samples, and can therefore be done centra lly, whereas culture has to be performed on fresh sputum samples, which can lead to variable results due to variability in testing methods between laboratories.

Refer to glossary of terms for the definition of PCD. End of Study (EoS): Last testing results released of samples collected at Visit 3. Duration of the stud y: The study will last approximately 1year for each subject. Note: Screening visit should ideally occur not more than 6 weeks before visit 1. Epoch 001 : Prospective data collection starting at Screening Visit (Pre -Month 0) and endi ng at Visit 3 (Month 12). Synopsis Table 1 Study groups and epochs foreseen in the study Study GroupsNumber of subjectsAge (Min/Max)Epoch Epoch 001 Prospective Approx 200 40 years X Discussion of study designThe primary objective of this study is to prospectively investigate the prevalence and distribution of bacteria and viruses isolated from sputum samples from moderate to very severe COPD patients and at the time of AECOPD, in Asian populations. I n order to increase the chance that the patients will exacerbate during the study , only patients with a documented history of at least 1 moderate or severe AECOPD in the previous y ear will be recruited, as this is known to be the best predictor of AECOPD [Hur st, 2010 . Therefore, this study will permit an estimation of incidence of AECOPD in a COPD population at increased risk of exacerbation. I t will not provide a true population- based incidence of AECOPD. In order to stud y factors affecting disease progress ion in Asia Pacific, prospective data from a relatively large cohort of COPD patients is essential.

EXACT PRO will be used to assess breathlessness, cough and presence of sputum, chest sy mptoms, difficulty bringing up sputum, feeling tired or weak, sleep disturbance, and feeling scared or worried about their condition. Advantages to this approach include standardised data, reduced recall bias, and the potential to identify events and determine resolution based on a predefined scoring algorithm Leidy, 2011 . Standardised questionnaires completed during stud y visits include the SGRQ -C and the CAT. The SGRQ -C is designed to assess HRQOL , current health and does not specify a recall period. The CAT is a simple, short, patient -completed in strument to assess HRQOL and s ymptom burden in patients with COPD. The CAT has good internal consistency and test -retest reliability , correlates strongl y with the SGRQ -C, and is able to distinguish between stable patients and those undergoing an AECOPD Jones, 2012 . Number of subjects The target is to enrol approximately 200 eligible moderate to very severe COPD patients.

Background Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common preventable and treatable disease characterised b y persistent airflow obstruction which is not fully reversible and which is usually progressive in the long term. The classification of COPD severit y is done based on the patient’s spirometric classification according to [GOLD, 2013 ]. The airflow limitation in COPD patients can be classified into GOLD grades as shown in Table 1[GOLD, 2013]. In this study , additional parameters are going to be collected in order to allow for a combined assessment that could be used for future evaluation, as detailed in Figure 1[GOLD, 2017]. Table 1 Classification of severity of airflo w limitation in COPD (based on post -bronchodilator FEV 1) GOLD grade In patients with FEV 1/ FVC < 0.70: GOLD 1: Mild FEV 1≥ 80% predicted GOLD 2: Moderate 50% ≤ FEV 1< 80%predicted GOLD 3: Severe 30% ≤ FEV 1< 50%predicted GOLD 4: Very Severe FEV 1< 30% predicted GOLD = Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease; FEV 1= forced expiratory volume in 1 second; FVC =forced vital capacity Figure 1 The refined A BCD assessment tool GOLD = Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease; CAT = COPD assessment test; FEV 1= forced expiratory volume in 1 second; FVC =forced vital capacity; mMRC = Modified British Medical Research Council Questionnaire CONFIDENTIAL 201112 (EPI-NTHI-001 BOD APA) Protocol Amendment 3 Final 75661ebdab2e949f7a1f1bc2071b9dec72aceccf27 19-OCT-2018"
27,page_27,"CONFIDENTIA L 201112 (EPI-NTHI -001 BOD APA) Protocol Amendm ent 3 Final 19-OCT -2018 28In addition to the airflow limitation, number of exacerbation per year and number of hospitalizations per y ear and CAT score will be collected at the enrollment in order to allow for the classification according to the [ GOLD , 2017 ]: Patient Group A –Low Risk, L ess Sy mptoms Typically GOLD 1 or GOLD 2 (Mild or Moderate airflow limitation); and/or 0 -1 exacerbation per y ear and no hospitalization for exacerbation; and CAT score < 10 or mMRC grade 0 -1 Patient Group B –Low Risk, More Sy mptoms Typically GOLD 1 or GOLD 2 (Mild or Moderate airflow limitation); and/or 0 -1 exacerbation per y ear and no hospitalization for exacerbation; and CAT score ≥ 10 ormMRC grade ≥ 2 Patient Group C – H igh Risk, L ess Sy mptoms Typically GOLD 3 or GOLD 4 (Severe or Very Severe airflow limitation); and/or ≥ 2 exacerbations per year or≥ 1 with hospitalization for exacerbation; and CAT score < 10 or mMRC grade 0 -1 Patient Group D –High Risk, More Sy mptoms Typically GOLD 3 or GOLD 4 (Severe or Very Severe airflow limitation); and/or ≥ 2 exacerbations per yearor ≥ 1 with hospitalization for exacerbation; and CAT score ≥ 10 or mMRC grade ≥ 2. The airflow limitation in COPD is associated with an enhanced and ch ronic inflammatory response to noxious particles and gases in the airway s and the lungs [ Hogg , 2004]. The most important environmental risk factor for COPD is tobacco smoking. However, long-term exposure to traffic pollution and biomass smoke are also important contributors. Indoor air pollution (generated largely b y inefficient and poorly ventilated stoves burning biomass fuels such as wood, crop waste and dung , or coal) for instance accounts for the high prevalence of COPD among non- smoking women in parts of the Middle East, Africa and Asia WHO , 2013 . COPD is the fi fth leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for 6% of all deaths globall y [WHO , 2015]. A recent study reported high overall morbidity and mortality rates due to COPD in the Asia Pacific region. The prevalence of moderate to severe COPD in adults aged 30 years or above was estimated to be 5.9% in South Korea, 5.4% in Taiwan, 4.7% in Australia and 3.5% in Hong Kong [ Tan, 2009]. The overall estimated prevalence COPD in Asia -Pacific was estimated to be 6.2% with 19.1% having severe COPD [ Lim, 2015]. The prevalence and burden of COPD are projected to continue to increase in the coming decades due to continued exposure to risk factors and the changing age structure of the world’s population [ Mathers , 2006 . In Asia, urbanisation is expected to play a major role in the increase of the number of prevalent cases of COPD between 2010 and 2020 [ Tan, 2009 . In terms of the number of deaths, the burden of disease is higher in the Asia-Pacific region when compared to the industrialised western countries. It was estimated through mathema tical modelling that 56.6 million people aged 30 years had moderate to severe COPD with a prevalence rate of 6.3% [ Ko, 2008]. The morbidity and mortality of COPD is substantially contributed to b y acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). An AECOPD is defined as “a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, made when a patient with COPD experiences an acute worsening in respiratory symptoms (typically dyspnoea, cough, sputum quantity and/or sputum purulence), and in whom no alternative specific cause for that deterioration has been CONFIDENTIAL 201112 (EPI-NTHI-001 BOD APA) Protocol Amendment 3 Final 75661ebdab2e949f7a1f1bc2071b9dec72aceccf28 19-OCT-2018"
28,page_28,"CONFIDENTIA L 201112 (EPI-NTHI -001 BOD APA) Protocol Amendm ent 3 Final 19-OCT -2018 29identified by clinical examination and/or corroborative testing. The worsening in respiratory symptoms may or may not warrant a change in underl ying therapy and the symptoms will ty picall y resolve over a period of day s to weeks” [ERS/ATS Draft Task Force Recommendations, Major Sy mposium, ERS Scientific Congress Barcelona 2013 . AECOPD are often associated with concurrent deteriorations in pulmonary function and increases in both local and sy stemic inflammation. Higher exacerbation rates have been related to a faster decline in lung function and are known to have a negative effect on the patient’s quality of life. Moreover, frequent exacerbations are associated with significant mortality , particularl y if they require hospitalisation. Between 40 -60% of medical expenditure for COPD is a direct consequence of AECOPD Cazzola , 2008 . The severity of AECOPD can be graded according to the intensity of medical intervention required (see Table 2 ) [Wedzicha , 2007 . Table 2 Classification of severity of A ECOPD Grade Intensity of medical inter vention Mild Controlled with an increase in dosage of regular medications Moderate Requires treatment with systemic corticosteroids and/ or antibiotics Severe Requires hospitalisation Bacteria, viruses and environmental pollution are also thought to be important causes of AECOPD [ Sapey , 2006 : The lungs are not sterile and are known to be colonised with different strains of bacteria [ Charlson, 2011; Erb-Downward, 2011; Monsó , 1995]. I t has been suggested that the bronchial bacterial load increases during AECOPD [ Miravitlles, 2002; Wilkinson , 2006 . Based on a recent literature review, the most frequent bacterial pa thogens identified during AECOPD in European countries and in the USA were Haemophilus influenzae ( H. influenzae ), Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.pneumoniae ), Moraxella catarrhalis (M. catarrhalis ), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.aeruginosa) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) [Mapi Research Trust - literature review for GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals . However, it has been suggested that the infectious aetiology of AECOPD can vary according to geographical region. In Asia, a rise in infections caused b y P.aeruginosa and the Gram -negatives Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae ) and Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii ) has been reported in several countries [ Hui, 2 011; Ye, 2013]. I n addition, the infectious aetiology of AECOPD has also been suggested to vary according to the severity of the illness, with P. aeruginosa being particularl y common in patients with advanced disease Domenech , 2013; Ko , 2007 . The most commonly detected viruses during AECOPD are Human Rhinoviruses (HRV ) , RSV, coronaviruses, influenza, parainfluenza and adenoviruses [De Serres , 2009; Sapey , 2006]. It has also been shown that viruses can be present in the airway s of stable COPD patients, suggesting that some respiratory viruses may cause persistent low- grade infection contributing to the pathogenesis of disease [Mohan , 2 010]. Mixed bacterial and viral co -infections occur in 8 -58% of exacerbations [ De Serres , 2009; Hutchinson, 2007; Papi , 2006; Perotin, 2013; Wilkinson , 2006].

29,page_29,"CONFIDENTIA L 201112 (EPI-NTHI -001 BOD APA) Protocol Amendm ent 3 Final 19-OCT -2018 30AECOPD is sudden worsening of COPD s ymptoms. Many studies have attempted to measure the burden of bacterial or viral infections in patients with AECOPD, but very few have investigated the presence of mixed viral and bacterial infections both in stable COPD patients and during AECOPD. 1.2. Rationale for the study Because the infectious aetiology of AECOPD has been suggested to vary according to geographical region, the primary purpose of this study (which will be conducted in several countries in Asia Pacific) is to evaluate the occurrence of potential bacterial and viral pathogens in the sputum of stable COPD patients and at the time of AECOPD. Given the increasing and projected burden of COPD in the Asia Pacific region, this study will also evaluate the frequency , severity and duration of AECOPD, as well as the impact of AECOPD on health -related quality of life (HRQOL), healthcare utilisation and lung function. In addition, both PCR and bacteriological methods will be used for characterisation and (quantification in some cases) of bacteria in sputum. To date, identification of bacteria and assessment of bacterial load is done in the vast majority of cases b y culture. However, the few studies that have compared culture with PCR demonstrated that PCR is more discriminatory at detecting ty pical airway bacteria [ Curran , 2007; Singh , 2014 . Moreover, in a multi -centre study , PCR has the advantage that it can be performed on stored sputum samples, and can therefore be done centrall y, whereas culture has to be performed on fresh sputum samples, which can lead to variable results due to variability in testing methods between laboratories. 2. OBJECTIVES 2.1. Primary objective To estimate the proportion of potential bacterial and viral pathogens (overall and by species) detected in sputum of stable COPD patients and during AECOPD, using respectivel y bacteriological methods and viral PCR, over the course of 1 year.

Discussion of study design The primary objective of this study is to prospectively investigate the prevalence and distribution of bacteria and viruses isolated from sputum samples from moderate to ve ry severe COPD patients and at the time of AECOPD, in Asian populations. In order to increase the chance that the patients will exacerbate during the study , only patients with a documented history of at least 1 moderate or severe AECOPD in the previous y ear will be recruited, as this is known to be the best predictor of AECOPD [ Hurst , 2010 . Therefore, this study will permit an estimation of incidence of AECOPD in a COPD population at increased risk of exacerbation. It will not provide a true population -based incidence of AECOPD. In order to stud y factors affecting disease progression in As ia Pacific, prospective data from a relatively large cohort of COPD patients is essential. The use of electronic Diary Cards to detect changes in the respiratory symptoms that define an AECOPD, the standardised questionnaires and spirometry assessments wil l allow robust conclusions to be drawn about the effects of exacerbations on decline in lung function and HRQOL . EXACT PRO will be used to assess breathlessness, cough and presence of sputum, chest symptoms, difficulty bringing up sputum, feeling tired or weak, sleep disturbance, and feeling scared or worried about their condition. Advantages to this approach include standardised data, reduced recall bias, and the potential to identify events and determine resolution based on a predefined scoring algorithm  Leidy , 2011 . Standardised questionnaires completed during stud y visits include the SGRQ -C and the CAT. The SGRQ -C is designed to assess HRQOL, current heal th and does not specify a recall period. The CAT is a simple, short, patient- completed instrument to assess HRQOL and symptom burden in patients with COPD. The CAT has good internal consistency and test-retest reliabilit y, correlates strongly with the SGRQ -C, and is able to distinguish between stable patients and those undergoing an AECOPD  Jones , 2012 .

Detection of A ECOPD Occurrence of potential AECOPD will be monitored b y means of electronic Diary Cards which the subject will use to record his/ her morning s ymptoms on a dail y basis. The electronic Diary Cards will be programmed as to detect potential AECOPD as follows (based on the Anthonisen criteria [ Anthonisen, 1987]): Worsening of two or more of the following major symptoms for at least two consecutive day s: dy spnoea, sputum volume, sputum purulence (colour), OR Worsening of any major symptom together with any of the following minor symptoms for at least two consecutive day s: sore throat, colds (nasal discharge and/or nasal congestion), fever (oral temperature 37.5°C) without other cause, increased cough, increased wheeze. Note that: The same two symptoms do not have to be present on both days as long as at least one major symptom is present on both days. Each time a potential AECOPD is detected via the electronic Diary Card, the device will alert t he subject to contact the study site, and at the same time an alert will be sent to the site so that the investigator or medicall y qualified individual contacts the subject to determine if the alert is an AECOPD or not, and if an AECOPD visit is warranted. In addition, the site should proactivel y follow- up all data received via the electronic Diary Card and contact the subject whenever deemed necessary . During the contact with the subject, the investigator or medicall y qualified individual will determine whether the subject might actually be experiencing an AECOPD (e.g. notifications that can be explained solely by increased phy sical activity will not be considered): If the investigator or medically qualified individual concludes that the subject is not experiencing an AECOPD, this should be documented/ reported in the electronic Diary website (Study Works) . Please refer to study procedures manual (SPM) for more details on how to perform this. If the investigator or medically qualified individual concludes t hat the subject may be experiencing an AECOPD, an AECOPD visit will be scheduled as soon as possible after the onset of AECOPD symptoms as recorded in the electronic Diary Card or confirmed b y the subject (maximum 96 hours after onset of symptoms and, if applicable, preferabl y before starting treatment with antibiotics). The AECOPD onset date will be captured in the eCRF and additional information about severit y will be also collected. In case the AECOPD is confirmed but no AECOPD visit can take place, the site should record the information in the medical records subject files, and in the eCRF in medical records section and obtain all relevant information regarding the AECOPD (hospital record, medical record etc.) and record this in the eCRF. If the investig ator concludes the subject is experiencing/continuing with the same event for which a visit has been performed alread y, an AECOPD visit should not take place. Medical treatment should be foreseen according to standard medical practice outside of the study .

SAFETY The investigator or site staff is/are responsible during the stud y for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria and definition of an SAE as provided in this protocol. Each subject wi ll be instructed to contact the investigator immediatel y should they/the subject manifest an y signs or sy mptoms they perceive as serious. 7.1. Safet y definitions 7.1.1. Definition of an adverse event (Amended 1 9October 2018) An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence i n a subject, temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product, or temporally associated with a study procedure. Examples of an AE include Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction. Examples of an AE DO NOT include: Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., endoscop y, appendectomy); the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE. Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (e.g., social and/or convenience admission to a hospital, admission for routine examination). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. Occurrence of a severe AECOPD, unless in the opinion of the Investigator this is related to study procedure. 7.1.2. Definition of a serious adverse event An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that: a.Results in death, b.Is life -threatening, Note: The term ‘life- threatening’ in the definition of ‘seri ous’ refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which h ypothetically might have caused death, had it been more severe.

59,page_59,"CONFIDENTIA L 201112 (EPI-NTHI -001 BOD APA) Protocol Amendm ent 3 Final 19-OCT -2018 60c.Requires hospitalisation or prolongation of an existing hospit alisation, Note: I n general, hospitalisation signifies that the subject has been admitted at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or in an out -patient setting. Compl ications that occur during hospitalisation are also considered AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalisation or fulfils any other serious criteria, the event will also be considered serious. When in doubt as to whether ‘hospitalisation’ occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition (known or diagnosed prior to informed consent signature) that did not worsen from baseline is NOT considered an SAE. d.Results in disability /incapacity , Note: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nause a, vomiting, diarrhoea, influenza like illness, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. or e.Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject Medical or scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalisation but m ay jeopardise the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation. 7.1.3. Clinical laboratory parameters and other abnormal assessments qualify ing as A Es or SA Es In absence of diagnosis, abnormal laboratory findings (e.g., clinical chemistry , haematology , urinal ysis) or other abnormal assessments that are judged by the investigator to be clinically significant will be recorded as AEs or SAEs if they meet the defini tion of an AE or an SAE (refer to Sections 7.1.1 and7.1.2). Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are present at baseline and significantly worsen following the start of the study will also be reported as AEs or SAEs. However, clinically signific ant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments that are associated with the disease being studied, unless judged by the investigator as more severe than expected for the subject’s condition, or that are present or detected at the start of the study and do not worsen, will not be reported as AEs or SAEs.

Active questioning to detect SAEs Each subject/ will be instructed to contact the investigator immediatel y should the subject manifest an y signs and symptoms (s)he perceives/ they perceive as serious. However, an occurrence of severe AECOPD is not defined as an SAE and therefore does not need to be reported as such, unless i n the opinion of the Investigator this is related to a study procedure. All SAEs either observed by the investigator or his/ her staff or reported by the subject spontaneously or in response to a direct question will be evaluated by the investigator. The n ature of each event, date and time of onset, outcome, intensity and possible relationship to the study procedures should be established. When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g., hospital progres s notes, laboratory and diagnostics reports) relative to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant information regarding the AE/SAE in the eCRF. The investigator is not allowed to send photocopies of the subject’s medical records to GSK Biologicals instead of appropriatel y completing the eCRF. However, there may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested b y GSK Biologicals. In this instance, all subject identifiers will be blinded on the copies of the medical records prior to submission to GSK Biologicals. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis pertaining to the event based on signs, s ymptoms, and/ or other clinical information. I n such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE/SAE an d not the individual signs/s ymptoms. 7.2.2.2. Assessment of causality The investigator should assess the causalit y of each SAE. The investigator will use clinical judgement to determine the relationship between the SAEs and study participation. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underl ying diseases, other concomitant therap y and other risk factors will be considered and investigated. There may be situations when a SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK Biologicals. However, it is very important that the investigator alway s makes an assessment of causality for every event prior to submission of the SAE report to GSK Biologicals. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow- up information and update the SAE information accordingl y. If an event meets the criteria to be considered as ‘serious’ (see section 7.1.2 ), additional examinations/tests will be performed b y the investigator in order to determine ALL possibly contributing factors to each SAE.

Completion and transmission of SA Es reports related to study participation to GSK Once an investigator becomes aware that an SAE has occurred in a stud y subject, the investigator (or designee) must complete the information in the electronic Expedited Adverse Event Report WITHIN 24 HOURS. The report will alway s be completed as thoroughl y as possible with all available details of the event. Even if the investigator does not have all information re garding an SAE, the report should still be completed within 24 hours.

This back-up s ystem should only be used if the electronic reporting s ystem is not working and NOT if the s ystem is slow. As soon as the electronic reporting s ystem is working again, the in vestigator (or designee) must complete the electronic Expedited Adverse Event Report within 24 hours.

Updating of SA E after freez ing of the subject’s eCRF When SAE information is received after freezing of the subject’s eCRF, new or updated information should be recorded on a paper Expedited Adverse Event Report, with all changes signed and dated by the investigator. The updated rep ort should be faxed to the GSK Biologicals Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance department or to the Study Contact for Reporting SAEs (see the Sponsor Information ) within the designated reporting time frames specified in Table 11. Note: For studies using INFORM, freezing of the subject’s eCRF would mean removal of write access in the subject’s eCRF. 7.3.5. Regulatory reporting requirements for SA Es The investigator will promptly report all SAEs to GSK Biologicals in accordance with the procedures detailed in Section 7.3.1. GSK Biologicals has a legal responsibility to promptly notify , as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a pro duct under epidemiological investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by the investigator to the Study Contact for Reporting SAEs is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of other subjects are met.

Determination of sample size The primary objective of this study is to describe the proportion of bacterial and viral pathogens (overall and by species) detected in sputum in stable COPD and during AECOPD. Assuming around 90% of the All Enrolled Set participated in the study , on average 1 AECOPD visit and 80% of the above population set can provide a n evaluable sputum sample at AECOPD, for 240, 200, 160, a nd 50 enrolled subjects, one may expect around 180, 140, 120, 40 sputum samples, respectively . Assuming that results from these sputum samples are independent and that the between country variability is much smaller than the within country variability, we would have the following 95% exact confidence interval for different incidences in sputum samples from exacerbations (see Table 12).

COPD is the fifth leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for 6% of all deaths globally [WHO 2015]. A recent stud y reported high overall morbidity and mortality rates due to COPD in the Asia Pacific region. The prevalence of moderate to severe COPD in adults aged 30 years or above was estimated to be 5.9% in Sou th Korea, 5.4% in Taiwan, 4.7% in Australia and 3.5% in Hong Kong [Tan, 2009]. The overall estimated prevalence COPD in Asia- Pacific was estimated to be 6.2% with 19.1% having severe COPD [Lim, 2015] . The prevalence and burden of COPD are projected to continue to increase in the coming decades due to continued exposure to risk factors and the changing age structure of the world’s population [Mathers, 2006 . In Asia, CONFIDENTIAL 201112 (EPI-NTHI-001 BOD APA) Protocol Amendment 3 Final 75661ebdab2e949f7a1f1bc2071b9dec72aceccf82 19-OCT-2018"
82,page_82,"CONFIDENTIA L 201112 (EPI-NTHI -001 BOD APA) Protocol Amendm ent 3 Final 19-OCT -2018 83urbanisation is expected to play a major role in the increase of the number of prevalent cases of COPD between 2010 and 2020 [Tan, 2009 . In terms of the number of deaths, the burden of disease is higher in the Asia- Pacific region when compared to the industrialised western countries. It was estimated through mathematical modelling that 56.6 mill ion people aged 30 years had moderate to severe COPD with a prevalence rate of 6.3% [Ko, 2008]. Synopsis and Section 1.2 Rationale for the study Because the infectious aetiology of AECOPD has been suggested to vary according to geographical region, the p rimary purpose of this study (which will be conducted in several countries in Asia Pacific) is to evaluate the occurrence of bacterial and viral pathogens in the sputum of stable COPD patients and at the time of AECOPD. Given the increasing and projected b urden of COPD in the Asia Pacific region, this study will also evaluate the frequency , severit y and duration of AECOPD, as well as the impact of AECOPD on health- related quality of life (HRQOL), healthcare utilisation ,andlung functionand on exercise capa city. In addition, both PCR and bacteriological methods will be used for characterisation and (quantification in some cases) of bacteria in sputum. To date, identification of bacteria and assessment of bacterial load is done in the vast majority of cases b y culture. However, the few studies that have compared culture with PCR demonstrated that PCR is more discriminatory at dete cting ty pical airway bacteria [Curran, 2007; Singh ,2014 . Moreover, in a multi -centre study , PCR has the advantage that it can be performed on stored sputum samples, and can therefore be done centrall y, whereas culture has to be performed on fresh sputum samples, which can lead to variable results in case of due to variability in testing methods between laboratories. Synopsis and Section 2 Objectives Primary objective To estimate the proportion of bacterial and viral pathogens (overall and b y species) detected in sputum of stable COPD patients and during AECOPD.

I n order to increase the chance that the patients will exacerbate during the study , only patients with a documented history of at least 1 moderate or severe AECOPD in the previous y ear will be recruited, as this is known to be the best predictor of AECOPD [Hurst, 2010 . Therefore, this study will permit an estimation of incidence of AECOPD in a COPD population at increased risk of exacerbation. It will not provide a true population-based incidence of AECOPD. In order to stud y factors affecting disease progression in Asia Pacific, prospective data from a relatively large cohort of COPD patients is essential. The use of electronic Diary Cards to detect changes in the respiratory symptoms that define an AECOPD, the standardised questionnaires andspirometry assessments, and exercise capacity tests will allow robust conclusions to be drawn about the effects of exacerbations on decline in lung function and HRQOL. Furthermore, the completeness of vital status inform ation will allow to determine the effects of exacerbations and hospitalizations on mortality to be examined with confidence . EXACT PRO will be used to assess breathlessness, cough and presence of sputum, chest symptoms, difficulty bringing up sputum, feeli ng tired or weak, sleep disturbance, and feeling scared or worried about their condition. Advantages to this approach include standardised data, reduced recall bias, and the potential to identify events and determine resolution based on a predefined scorin g algorithm  Leidy, 2011 . Standardised questionnaires completed during stud y visits include the SGRQ -C and the CAT. The SGRQ -C is designed to assess HRQOL , current health and does not specify a recall period. The CAT is a simple, short, patient- completed instrument to assess HRQOL and symptom burden in patients with COPD. The CAT has good internal consistency and test - retest reliability , correlates strongl y with the SGRQ -C, and is able to distinguish between stable patients and those undergoing an AECOPD Jones, 2012 . Section 3.1.1 Detection of AECOPD Note that: Any symptom occurring on at least 5 consecutive days prior to a potential exacerbation will not be taken into account to define an exacerbation. Each time a potential AECOPD is detected via the ele ctronic Diary Card, the device will alert the subject to contact the study site, and at the same time an alert will be sent to the site so that the site staff contacts the subject to determine if the alert is an AECOPD or not, and if check whether an AECOPD visit is warranted. In addition, the site should CONFIDENTIAL 201112 (EPI-NTHI-001 BOD APA) Protocol Amendment 3 Final 75661ebdab2e949f7a1f1bc2071b9dec72aceccf86 19-OCT-2018"

During the contact with the subject, the site will determine whether the subject might actuall y be experiencing an AECOPD ( e.g.notifications that can be explained solely by increased ph ysical activity will not be considered): If the site concludes that the subject is notexperiencing an AECOPD, this should be documented/ repor ted in the eCRF . Please refer to study procedures manual (SPM) for more details on how to perform this. If the site concludes that the subject may be experiencing an AECOPD, an AECOPD visit will be scheduled as soon as possible after the onset of AECOPD s ymptoms as recorded in the electronic Diary Card or confirmed by the subject (maximum 96 hours after onset of s ymptoms and, if applicable, preferably before starting treatment with antibiotics). The AECOPD onset date will be captured in the eCRF and additi onal information about severity will be also collected. In case the AECOPD is confirmed but no AECOPD visit can take place, the site should record the information in the medical records subject files, and in the CRF in medical records section and obtain al l relevant information regarding the AECOPD(hospital record, medical record etc) and record this in the eCRF. During the AECOPD visit, the investigator will confirm the occurrence of the AECOPD based on clinical and medical judgement and based on the Antho nisen criteria , and will record its date of onset. The end date of the AECOPD and its severity will be determined/ confirmed b y the investigator /delegate during (a) follow -up phone call(s), which will take place at least every 2 weeks until the AECOPD has resolved. If an AECOPD occurs at the time when one of the scheduled stable study visits is planned, it should be handled and recorded as an AECOPD visit, with all relevant AECOPD visit study procedures performed and, if possible, the stable study visit s hould be re -scheduled to a later date, when the subject is stable again and within the time window specified in the protocol. However, in exceptional cases, in consultation with GSK Biologicals, the concluding visit (Visit 3, Month 12) may be exceptionally conducted outside of the allowed interval, if deemed necessary by the investigator. The reason for this should be documented in the eCRF. The investigator/site must engage their best efforts to reach the patients, however, if the site does not succeed in contacting the patient, the reason should be recorded and an explanation given about what occurred. For example, the subject could be hospitalized or could visit a different physician (and in that case medical record should be obtained), or the subject is on holidays or not able to go the site.

Section 3.1.1 Detection of AECOPD Each time a potential AECOPD is detected via the electronic Diary Card, the device will alert the subject to contact the study site, and at the same time an alert will be sent to the site so that the site staff investigator or medically qualified individual contacts the subject to determine if the alert is an AECOPD or not, and if an AECOPD visit is warranted. In addition, the site should proactivel y follow -up all data received via the electronic Diary Card and contact the subj ect whenever deemed necessary . During the contact with the subject, the siteinvestigator or medically qualified individual will determine whether the subject might actually be experiencing an AECOPD (e.g. notifications that can be explained solely by increased ph ysical activity will not be considered): If the investigator or medically qualified individual siteconcludes that the subject is notexperiencing an AECOPD, this should be documented/ reported in the eCRF in the electronic Diary website (StudyWork s).

STGG product not being available, it has been decided to replace it with cryobeads for storage of bacterial isolates. PCR testing on samples stored in cryobeads was shown to be as efficient as for samples stored in STGG. Besides, this decision has been taken for alignment with other COPD studies, where STGG solutions are no longer used. !Clarification of technique used for target identification. For the primary endpoint, various viral pathogens will be identified but not quantified. Along this line, the wording “and by HRV quantitative RT-PCR” has been removed from primary endpoint to avoid confusion as HRV viral load data will be reported as part of the tertiary endpoints. !Clarification in exclusion criteria section (4.3). Administration of antibiotics before study entry, where study entry is meant to be Visit 1. !Clarification in study procedure section (6.3) and in the section for recording current medication (6.4.2.10) during scheduled visits, where it has been specified that recording of any current medication is applicable for any disease not only COPD-related. Moreover, a footnote referring to Table 10 “Reporting period for SAE and AEs leading to withdrawal” has been added for further clarification, both in Table 4 and 5. !Addition of a section (actual 6.4.2.6) for Pregnancy test for Visit 1, Visit 2 and Visit 3.
