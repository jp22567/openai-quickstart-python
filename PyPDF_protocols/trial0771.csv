STATISTICA L CONSIDERA TIONS Sample size determination: Estimated as 78 patients (3 9per group) . Based on a large study of 2783 patients referred for rest/stress PET ( 1) which suggested a SD of 0.65 for CFR at baseline. Under the hypothesis of a correlation of 0.6between baseline assessment and week 4 -assessment the SD for the change from baseline to Week 4 could be estimated at 0.58. 35 patients per group will be needed to detect with 1 sided test alpha 0.05 and 80% power, a clinically significant relevant difference versus placebo of 0.35 in the change from baseline in PET CFR to Week 4. To reach this number of patient s 78 patients need to be included in this study with the hypothesis of 10% inevaluable . Analysis population: The efficacy population will be the modified intend -to-treat population, defined as all randomized patients analyzed according to the treatment group allocated by rand omization, receiving at least one dose or part of a dose of the investigational medicinal product and having abaseline PET scan CFR a ssessment available. The safety population will include all randomized patients who received at least one dose or part of a dose of the IMP. In the safety analysis, patients will be analyzed in the treatment group as actually received. Primary analysis: efficacy analyses will be performed on ITT population . Thechange in CFR from baseline to week 4 will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model. The model will include the two fixed categorical effect of treatment group ( pooled SAR407899 doses versus placebo) and of the presence of angiographically successful PC I (YES/NO) as well as a continuous fixed covariate of baseline CFR. The co rresponding interaction of order two will be also included in the model. The final model will provide adjusted least -squares means (LS means) (electronic 4.0)"

To evaluate the impact of missing values on treatment effect estimation, a multiple imputation metho d will be used. Analysis of the key secondary endpoint: The secondary analysis will use a similar model as primary analysis applied to the change from baseline to Week 4 in SAQ PL. The final model will provide adjusted least -squares means (LS means) estimates of the change from baseline to Week 4 in both treatment groups and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The difference of these estimates will be tested at the 10% 1-sided alpha level and the 95% confidence interval of the difference will be provided. A safety review with a DMC meeting will start as soon as the first 19patients will have been randomized and have finished the first week of treatment. Additional analyses for safety may be performed in this study. Safety analysis: Safety a nalyses will be descriptive, based on the safety populatio n with a focus on BP , creatinine and cystatin C. The safe ty analysis will focus on the TEAE period. This period is defined as the time from the first administration of the IMP to the last administra tion of the IMP +5times the half- life. The half -life being from 20 to 31 hours depending on the age of the patients, a conservative estimate of 31 hours is used for all patients (thus 5 times the half -life corresponds to 5 times 31 hours ie,approximately 7 days) .

Percutan eous coronary intervention has not been shown to reduce mortalit y in patients with stable CAD . Data from large trials investigating the use of PCI in patients with stable CAD show that angina is still experienced in a large number of patien ts one y ear after the procedure and that this proportion increases over time. In a select group of these patients who have no current obstructive CAD but with evidence of myocardial ischemia, are thought to be due coronary microvascular dy sfunction as a possible cause of persistent stable angina ( 2, 3). 4.1.1.2 Patients with microvascular angina (MVA) Patients who present with angina and a positive noninvasive test may undergo a diagnostic coronary angiography . The y ield of elective coronary angiography in such patients is unsatisfactory with no coronary artery disease (defined as <20% stenosis in all vessels) reported in close to 40% of the patients (4). Amongst them a significant proportion of patients have coronary microvascular d ysfunction (CMD), a disease that affects the walls and inner lining of tiny coronary artery blood vessels that branch off from the larger coronary arteries (5). Accordingl y, this ty pe of angina is categorized as microvascular angina (MVA). Irrespective of the degree of coronary artery disease, higher angina episodes frequencies are associated with low er ph ysical functioni ng, quality of life (QoL) (6), angina stability , treatment satisfaction and higher prevalence of anxiety and depression, hospital re- admission ( 7,8)and repeat coronary angiograph y (9). 4.1.1.3 Pathophysiology and purported beneficial mechanism of Rho -Kinase inhibition: Abnormalities in vascular smooth musc le cell (VSMC) as well as vascular endothelial cells in the heart’s smallest arterioles have been widel y discussed as major contributor in the pathophysiology of MVA ( 10,11). The finding that a reduced coronary blood flow response to direct arteriolar dilator agents like adenosine, dipy ridamole or papaverine has been shown in patients with angina pectoris and normal coronary angiograms suggests abnormalities of sm ooth muscle cell relaxation in MVA ( 12,13,14). In addition, an impairment of endothelium- dependent coronary microvascular dilation is also described in patients with MVA ( 13,14,15). (electronic 4.0)"
30,page_30,"Amended Clinical Trial Protoco l NO 03 18-Apr-2018 ACT14656 Version number: 1 Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly confidential Page 31Physiologic levels of rho -kinase activity are important for vascular homeostasis, whereas on the opposite, enhanced rho -kinase activit y could causes vascular diseases through VSMC hypercontractility /proliferation, endothelial cell damage and promotion of pro -inflammatory pathway s (16). Figure 1 -Rho kinase pathway Myosin-binding subunit my osin light chain phosphatase (MBS) is one of the major endogenous substrates for Rho -kinase, and its phosphory lation is acknowledged as a ma rker for Rho- kinase activity in various tissues including kidney (17), vasculature ( 18) and cardiac tissue ( 19). Th us using a pMBS/totMBS, a statistically significant 1.5- fold higher Rho kinase activity was considered in circulating neutrophils of patients with pulmonary arterial hy pertension (PAH) compared to health y controls ( 20) and a 1.9 -fold higher activit y in patients with cardiovascular diseases compared healthy controls ( 21). Moreover, a statistically significant reduction from baseline of pMBS/totMBS ratio was observed in patients with vasospastic angina after treatment with CCBs ( 22). SAR407899 is a potent ATP- competitive rho -kinase inhibitor ( 23) and has, based on this MoA, the potential to improve patient conditions with MVA through endothelium dependent [ prevention of ROCK induced inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide sy nthase (eNOS ) expression] and endothe lium independent effects (prevention of hypervasoconstriction) ( 24). Such beneficial effects could therefore potentially lead to an improvement in sy mptoms and quality of life, and a decreased burden of CV procedures/hospitalization for patients with microvascular d ysfunction and/or non -obstructive coronary artery disease. Based on the above described patient needs and the therapeutic potential of SAR407899, patients with microvascular angina and/or persistent angina despite successful PCI will be evalu ated in the POC -study ACT14656.

SAR407899 has alread y been studi ed in health y adult volunteers, healthy elderly subjects, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and patie nts with erectile dy sfunction. Although SAR407899 was generall y well -tolerated, dose -related s ymptomatic orthostatic hy potension occurred in some subjects, primarily after administration of the first dose, and particularl y in patients who had renal dysfunction and who were treated with concomitant anti- hypertensive drugs. Orthostatic hypotension is considered to be a mechanism -related effect and will be mitigated in the current study by using an individual dose titration approach. I n healthy young subjects, a few cases of serum creatinine increase >30% were observed however the values remain within normal range . This effect was not observed in elderl y subjects or in pati ents with CKD. 4.3 RATIONA LEFOR THE STUDY This study will evaluate SAR407899 compared with placebo in a population of patients with microvascular angina and/or persistent angina despite angiographically successful PCI(typical or atypical symptoms of angina p ectoris ), non- obstructive (<50% stenosis) coronary arteries on angiogram or intermediate stenosis with FFR > 0.80 or iFR >0.89, and microvascular dy sfunction documented b y a global CFR <2.0 measured b y PET . Angiographically successful balloon angioplast y with a reduction of a minimum stenosis diameter to <50% or for coronary stents a minimum diameter stenosis of <10%, with a final TI MI flow G rade 3 (visually assessed by angiograph y) without side branch loss, flow -limiting dissection, distal embolization, or angiographic thrombus. This study will assess whether SAR407899 improves PET scan global CFR (25) before and after administration of a pharmacol ogic stressor (ie ,vasodilator). Low CFR is considered as a hallm ark of microvascular d ysfunction . An improvement in CFR observed after interventions in this patient population would suggest an improvement in the underl ying causal vascular biological abnormalities. Assessment of patient- reported outcome using the Seatt le Angina Questionnaire physical limitation scale (SAQ -PL) due to its sensitivity will be used as secondary endpoint . Change in angina episodes and short- acting nitrate intakes will be collected in the patient’s diary . 4.4 DESIGN RA TIONA LE AND RISK A SSESSMENT This study will be placebo -controlled as no treatment is currentl y approved in the population with microvascular angina and/or persistent stable angina despite angiographically successful PCI .The drug will be tested on top of standard treatments for angin a excluding nitrates (except short -acting nitrates) and PDE 5 inhibitors that should be discontinued at lea st one week before baseline PET assessment and not used during the study in order to avoid masking the effects of SAR407899 while increasing the risk of orthostatic hy potension. Beta-blockers act directly on the heart to reduce heart rate, c ontractility , AV conduction and ectopic activity . Additionally , they may increase perfusion of ischemic areas by (electronic 4.0)"
32,page_32,"Amended Clinical Trial Protoco l NO 03 18-Apr-2018 ACT14656 Version number: 1 Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly confidential Page 33prolonging the diastole and increasing vascular re sistance in non-ischemic areas this is why beta -blockers are currentl yfirst-line anti -anginal therap y in stable CAD patients without contraindications according to ESC 2013 guidelines on stable CAD (26).Henc e, beta-blockers should be kept at the same dose, as it could potentially impact the assessment of efficacy . SAR407899 will be administered in the morning and at bedtime . A sno relevant food - effect was demonstrated, dose may be taken with or without food as per preference of the patient. Twice a day (BID) regimen has been chosen in order to minimize peak concentration effects while maintaining sufficient trough levels. Decrease i n BP (hypotension, orthostatic dysregulation) is considered as a mechanism - related effect and will be mitigated by using a dose titration approach. A safet y review will be performed by the DMC when 19 patients will have completed the first week of treatment. The DMC will review the clinical safet y data including AESIs . During the safet y evaluation of the first 19enrolled patients, these patients wil l continue to receive IMPs as per the titration schedule described above and enrolment will continue . If patient does not tolerate a dose level due to hypotension, sy mptomatic orthostatic hypotension wi th SBP decrease ≥20mmHg, at Minute 3 or Minute 5 after changing position from seated to standing, the investigator will decrease the dose level of the investigational product to the previous tolerated dose level for the remaining duration of the study . Overall,the exposure to the study drug should last for 4 weeks in total (3 weeks for the titration phase and 1week for the maintenance phase) for all patients. Patients will be followed one week after the end of the stud y treatment to col lect an y potential AEs during the washout period. Serum creatinine will be monitored .Creatinine is filtered in glomerulus and also partly eliminated in urine via an active secretion mediated by organic cation transporter -2 (OCT2) . These observed increases in adults could then possibly be explained by inhibition of its active secretion b y SAR407899 which is a weak in vitro OCT2 inhibitor. Serum cystatin C, which is filtered in glomerulus but not subject to tubular secretion, will be measured in parallel to serum creatinine to assess glomerular filtration rate. Specific parameters rationale Primary endpoint: Coronary flow reserve (CFR), represents blood flow to the my ocardium; the critical factor in angina. It is th e endpoint with the most abundant clinical data in MVA patients. CFR is the ratio of the maximal myocardial blood flow (MBF )after a h yperemic stimulus (such as intravenous adenosine injection) to base line resting blood flow. In patients with (electronic 4.0)"
33,page_33,"Amended Clinical Trial Protoco l NO 03 18-Apr-2018 ACT14656 Version number: 1 Property of the Sanofi Group -strictly confidential Page 34normal endothelial function, adenosine increases MBF by a factor of 2.5 or more while in patients with endothelial dysfunction the incr ease is less than 2.0 ( 27). Secondary endpoints: The Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) (28) was used in pilot MVA studies. It is currentl y used in clinical trials in MVA populations for ranolazine and thus provided a basis for statistical calculations. The SAQ is a self -report instrument with 19 items designed to quantify the phy sical and emotional effects of coronary artery disease. The questionnaire has a 4 -week recall period. It yields five dimensions, each scored separatel y: physical l imitation, angina stability , angina frequency , treatment satisfaction, and disease perception . ASAQ -7 summary score can also be derived using 7 items from the phy sical limitation, angina frequency and disease perception domains. The phy sical limitation (SAQ-PL) dimension is the most relevant for defining treatment benefit in this trial and was thus specified as a secondary objective. The SAQ -PL dimension measures how common daily activities representing low, medium, and high exertional requirements are limited by angina (9 items). It is scored by assigning each response an ordinal value, beginning with 1 for the response that implies the lowest level of functioning, and summing across the 9 items. The score is then transformed to 0- 100 range by subtracting the lowest possible scale score, dividing b y the range of the scale and multiplying b y 100. The possible range of scores is therefore 0 to 100, with higher scores better . A change of 10 points is considered to be clinicall y important. Safety will be assessed during the whole study on adverse events w ith a special focus on BP,laboratory data and renal function. Exploratory endpoints: Assessment of angina episodes with or without short- acting nitrate intakes Angina episodes and short- acting nitrate intak es collected b y the patients in a diary will be measured. This will allow assessing the number of angina episodes ( and their severity ). Assessment of other dimensions of the SAQ and SAQ- 7 score (29) The SAQ yields five dimensions, each scored separatel y: physical limitation, angina stability , angina frequency , treatment satisfaction, and disease perception. All the dimensions except SAQ -PL will be assessed. TheSAQ -7 summary score can also be derived using 7 i tems from the ph ysical limitation, angina frequency and disease perception domains. Assessment of patient’s perceptions of treatment and symptoms The patient qualitative self-assessment aims to better understand the patient’s views on their treatment and s ymptoms at baseline and at the end of the study . Three questions assessing the patient’s perception will be asked and a free -textbox will be provided for patients to give qualitative answers.

Code breaking can be performed at an y time b y using the proper module of the interactive response technology (IRT) and/or b y calling an y other phone number provided by the Sponsor for that purpose. If the blind is broken, the Investigator should document the date, time of the day and the reason for code breaking.

Refer to Section 10.5 for suspected unexpected serious adverse drug reaction requiring unblinding by the Sponsor. 8.3 METHOD OF A SSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMEN T GROUP At the screening visi t, patients who will sign the informed consent form will be assigned an incremental subject number according to chronological order. The subject number remains unchanged during the study and allows the patient to be identified during the whole study . Stratification on the presence of angiographicall y successful PCI (YES/NO) will be performed. The randomized treatment kit number list is generated centrall y by Sanofi. The IMPs are packaged in accordance with this list. The randomization and the treatment allocation (1:1) are performed centrally by an interactive voice/web response sy stem (IVRS/I WRS). The IVRS/I WRS allocates treatment kits to the patient according to a prespecified randomization list, generated b y the compan y in charge of the IVRS/I WRS. A patie nt is considered as randomized as soon as the IVRS /IWRS has assigned a patient to active orplacebo and indicated a treatment kit to be allocated to the patient, regardless whether the treatment kit was used or not (ie, patient registered by the IVRS/ IWRS). A patient cannot be randomized more than once in the study . All screening -failed patients will be entered in database with their subject number allocated at screening. 8.4 PACKA GING A ND LA BELI NG For the double -blind treatment package (DBTP), e ach double -blind SAR407899 treatment kit, containing either SAR 407899 or matching placebo, will be prepared to contain 1 weekl y (7 day s +2 extra day s) “child resistant” wallets of 36 capsules in each.

The temperature of the site storage room should be check edat least dail y and recorded on a log sheet. The IMP that will be stored at the investigational site should be kept in an appropriate lo cked room, under the responsibility of the Investigator or designee. 8.6 RESPONSIBILITIES The Investigator, the hospital pharmacist, or other personnel allowed to store and dispense the IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP used in the clinical tri al is securel y maintained as specified b y the Sponsor and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. All IMPswill be dispensed in accordance with the I nvestigator's prescription and it is the Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an acc urate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained. Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, pertaining documentation, labeling, expiration date, etc) should be promptly notified to the Sponsor. S ome deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure. A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the Sponsor. In this case, the I nvestigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any reque st made b y the Sponsor, in order to recall the IMP and eliminate potential hazards. Under no circumstances will the I nvestigator supply IMP to a third part y allow the IMP to be used other than as directed b y this clinical trial protocol, or dispose of IMP in any other manner. 8.6.1 Treatment accountability and compliance Compliance of IMP: The first IMP intake (morning dosing) of each on-site visit will be performed under direct medical supervision at each on site visit. The Investigator or designee records the d osing information on the appropriate page(s) of the case report form.

Patients will be allowed to continue using sublingual nitrogly cerin as needed. St udies will be performed after 4 hours of fast ing and 24 hours of abstinence from caffeine- containing products. The PET scan will take approximately 2.5 hours, including patient preparation. Myocardial blood flow ( MBF) will be measured at rest and during maximal hy peremia using adenosine or regadenoson infusion, and using 13N-ammonia or82Rubidium as the flow tracer. After transmission imaging and beginning with the intravenous (IV) administration of the flow tracer , list mode images are acquired . Then, patients will undergo a standard infusion of ade nosine or bolus injection regadenoson. At peak h yperemia, a second dose of the flow tracer will be injected IV, and images recorded in the same manner . The heart rate, BP , and 12 -lead ECG will be recorded at baseline and throughout the infusion of adenosin e or regadenoson, and at recovery . All PET scans will be done for research (non -clinical) purposes only . For safet y reasons, all PET scans will be reviewed at the sites by site investigators for clinically important findings. No reports or anal yses will be provided to sites from the PET core laboratory and studies will not be assessed in real -time. 9.1.4.1.2 Risks and discomforts from the PET scans The risks and discomforts to the patients associated with the PET scan include those associated with administration of t he vasodilator and potentially aminophy lline that may be utilized to reverse the side effects due to vasodilator administration. Also, there are radiation risks related to the procedure and the radioactive flow tracers. These risks are detailed in the pati ent consent form. 9.1.4.2 Analysis of rest and stress myocardial perfusion PET i mages A complete analy sis of rest and stress my ocardial perfusion PET i mages will be performed. It will include: Quantitative anal ysis of all PET studies will be performed at the centr al core laboratory . The following anal yses will be performed: Semi -Quantitative Anal ysis: 1. Total Perfusion Deficit (TPD ): it measures the total left ventricular perfusion deficit at rest (reflecting scarred m yocardium) and during stress (reflecting both scarred + ischemic myocardium), as well as the difference between stress and rest (reflecting ischemic myocardium). TPD scores will be processed using standard software (CSI software, Cedars Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA). 2.For each patient, the following variables will be obtained at baseline and during the follow -up scans: 1.Rest TPD 2.Stress TPD 3.Difference TPD Quantification of left ventricular f unction : rest and post -stress left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF ) will be calculated from the gated my ocardial perfusion images using (electronic 4.0)"

For each patient, the following variables will be obtained at baseline and d uring the follow -up scans: (1) rest LVEF, and (2) p ost-stress LVEF Quantification of m yocardial blood flow and CFR : Absolute m yocardial blood flow (MBF, in mL /g/min) will be compute d from the dynamic rest and stress imaging series using commerciall y available software (Corridor4DM; Ann Arbor, MI) and previously validated methods ( 30,31,32). Automated regions of interest will be used to generate blood pool (arterial input function) and tissue time- activity curves. A validated 2-compartment tracer kinetic model for 13N-ammonia or 82Rubidium willbe used to quantify absolute MBF at rest and during peak hyperemic -stress. Per-patient regional an d global CFR will be calculated as the ratio of absolute MBF at stress over that at rest. Finally , a regional and global index of coronary vascular resistanc e (CVR ) will be generated b y dividing the mean arterial pressure by MBF (both at rest and during peak hyperemic -stress). For each patient, the following variables will be obtained at baseline a nd during the follow -up scans: 1.Rest MBF: individual values will be obtained for each of the coronary vascular territories (left anterior descending , LAD; left circumflex , LCX ; and right coronary artery , RCA ) and also for the entire LV (global rest MBF ). 2.Peak hy peremic -stress MBF: individual values will be obtained for each of the coronary vascular territories (LAD, L CX, and RCA) and also for the entire LV (global stress MBF). 3.Coronary flow reserve (CFR): individual values will be obtained for each of the coronary vascular territories (LAD, L CX, and RCA) and also for the entire LV (global CFR). 4. Rest CVR: individual values will be obtained for each of the coronary vascular territories (LAD, LCX, a nd RCA) and a lso for the entire left ventric le, LV (global rest CVR). 5.Peak hy peremic -stress CVR: individual va lues will be obtained for each of the coronary vascular territories (LAD, L CX, and RCA) and also for the entire LV (global stress CVR). 9.1.4.3 Angina episodes and short -acting nitrates : A diary is provided to the patient to collect the number and severit y (requi ring short -acting nitrate intakes) of angina episodes that he/ she will experience in between site’s visits. This patient’s diary will be reviewed b y the investigator or designee at each on -site visit . 9.1.4.4 Patient Reported Outcomes Change from baseline to end of study treatment/ Week 4 in the other dimensions of the SAQ (see Appendix C ). Change from baseline to end of study treatment/ Week 4 in the SAQ -7 score .

Assessment of the other dimensions of the SAQ Angina stability : measures whether angina has changed in frequency when patient performs his or her most strenuous level of activity (1 question). Angina frequency : measures frequency of angina over the previous 4 weeks (2 questions). Treatment satisfaction: measures patient satisfaction with current angina treatment (4questions). Disease perception: measures concern about angina in relation to quality of life and possibility of death (3 questions). Each SAQ dimension is scored from 0 -100 with higher scores better (as per the SAQ -PL; seeSection 4.4 ). A change of 10 points is considered to be clinicall y important for an y dimension. Assessment of the SAQ -7 (29) An SAQ summary score, called the SAQ -7, can be derived using the “best” 7 items from the three dimensions that directly measure patien ts’ current health status: Phy sical Limitation, Angina Frequency , and Disease Perception (“best” defined as the items that had the highest levels of concordance with the overall domain score). Scor es for each of the three dimensions were calculated using m ethodology analogous to that of the full SAQ, so that scores ranged from 0 to 100 for each dimension (although the number of items is smaller). The SAQ-7 score is derived as the average of the three domain scores. Patient’s perception of treatment and symp toms The patient qualitative self-assessment aims to better understand the patient’s views on their treatment and s ymptoms at base line and at the end of the treatment .Three questions assessing the patient’s perception will be asked and a free -text box will be provided for patients to give qualitative answers. This assessment should take between 5 -10 minutes, and the text will later be analyzed using qualitative data anal ysis software to perform content anal ysis using text mining. The pat ient will be asked to complete these three questions. The questions are: Day 1 and at the end of study treatment visit /Day 29: “Please think back over the past week .

This sample may be used to determine a possible relationship between genes and response to treatment with SAR407899, how the body processes SAR407899, and possible side effects to SAR407899. Genes that may be studied include those related to ROCK pathway and/or endothelial dy sfunction. This blood sample will be transferred to a site that will, on behalf of Sanofi, extract DNA from the sample and that is man aged b y Covance. This blood sample, and the DNA that is extracted from it, will be assigned a second number, a genetic ID (deidentification code) that is different from the patient ID. This “double coding” is performed to separate a subject’s medical information and DNA data. The clinical stud y data (coded by subject ID) will be stored in the clinical data management system (CDMS), which is a distinct database in a separate environment from the database containing the pharmacogenetic data (coded by genetic ID). The key linking subject ID and genetic ID will be maintained by a third part y, under appropriate access control. The matching of clinical data and pharmacogenetic data, for the purpose of data anal ysis, will be possible only by using this key , which will be under strict access control. All data will be reported only in coded form in order to maintain confidentiality . The DNA will be stored for up to 15 y ears from the completion of the clinical study report.

Withdrawal of consent for treatment should be distinguished from withdrawal of consent for follow -up visits and from withdrawal of consent for non -patient contact follow -up, eg, medical records check. Patients requesting with drawal should be informed that withdrawal of consent for follow- up may jeopardize the public health value of the study . Every effort should be made to convince the patients to perform the end of study treatment/D29 with assessment of primary and secondary endpoints including blood samples and pharmacokinetic samples. The end of stud y visit (D36) one week later should be done . This visit is not mandatory in case of premature study drug discontinuation. Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked about t he contribution of possible AEs to their decision to withdraw consent, and an y AE information elicited should be documented. Preferably the patient should withdraw consent in writing and, if the patient or the patient’s representative refuses or is phy sically unavailable, the site should document and sign the reason for the patient’s failure to withdraw consent in writing. All study withdrawals should be recorded b y the Investigator in the appropriate screens of the e-CRF and in the patient’s medical reco rds when considered as confirmed. In the medical record, at least the date of the withdrawal and the reason should be documented. For patients who fail to return to the site, unless the patient withdraws consent for follow -up,the investigator should make the best effort to re -contact the patient (eg, contact patient’s famil y or private ph ysician, review available registries or health care databases), and to determine his/her health status, including at least his/her vital status. Attempts to contact such p atients must be documented in the patient’s records (eg, times and dates of attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter) .The statistical analy sis plan will specify how these patients inevaluable for their primary endpoints will be considered.
