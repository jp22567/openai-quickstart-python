In Section 9.2.1, the definition of Full Analy sis Set (FAS) was clari fied and details w ere added on major protocol violations that would preclude inclusion in the Per Protocol Anal ysis Set (PPAS). 3.Added a summary of the proposed sensitivity anal yses for the co -primary endpoints in Section 9.2.3 . The protocol changes specified in Protoco l Administrative Change Letter 20December 2018 have been incorporated as follows: 1.Since atopic dermatitis has a natural history of chronic remissions and flares, subjects may be inappropriatel y disqualified during periods of remission, and may become eligibl e when re -screened during a flare episode. For subjects who are screen -failure due to not meeting the disease severity inclusion criteria, re-screening may be considered. This re-screening should onl y occur after discussion with Pfizer Medical Monitor (or designee) .

Prior treatment with topical JAK inhibitors is not exclusionary . Changes were made Section 4.2 Exclusion Criteria, Criterion 7 , and Section 5.9.2 Prohibited Medications and Treatments . 2.In Section 4.2 Exclusi on Criteria, Criterion 18 , it is clarified that the definition of “acceptable altern ative regimen” refers to acceptability as describe dby local standards of care . 3.In Appendix 3 Prohibited Concomitant Medications , the following medications are deleted form the CYP2C19 inhibitors list, as they are not inhibitors of CYP2C19 and were included inadvertentl y:Amitripty line (Elavil) , Clomipramine (Anafranil), Imipramine (Tofranil) . In addition, protocol inconsistencies and clarifications have been corrected as follows (ordered as they first appear in the protocol): The number of sites was updated in the Study Design sections. Clarified in the Schedule of Activities footnote q and in Section 7.3.4 that if the results of the TB test procedure using the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold I n-Tube Test are indeterminate, the test should be repeated.

A note has been added i n Section 4.2 Exclusion Criterion 10 and in Appendix 3 to clarify that the half -life refers to half -life of the parent drug and its metabolites which are inhibitors or inducers. The longest half -life should be used to calculate the period necessary to washout a medication prior to the first dose of investigational product. It was clarified in Section 4.4.1 Contraception, that male subjects are not required to use contraception. In Section 4.2 Exclusion C riteria, Criterion 19, the a bsolute ly mphocy te count in the parenthesis was corrected from <500/mm3to <750/mm3. A clarification to the criteria for screening ECG findings has been added in Section 7.3.5, as the intent is that the subject ’s screening ECG m ust not have clinically significant adverse findings.

17,page_17,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 18PROTOCOL SUMMARY Background an d Rationale: Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin disorder characterized by flaky skin lesions, intense pruritus, and a general deterioration in quality of life. Over the past 50 years, AD has become more prevalent, especiall y in industrialized, temperate countries such as the United States (US).1,2 AD is one of the most common, chronic, relapsing childhood derm atoses, impacting 15 -30% of all children in the US and many have disease that persists into adulthood with a lifetime prevalence of those affected in childhood reported to be 34%.3 Earlier reports indicated tha t, in up to 70% of cases, the disease greatl y improves or resolves b y late childhood, however more recent findings suggest that disease activit y remains manifest for a prolonged period of time. Based on a total of 7157 patients enrolled in the Pediatric E czema Elective Registry (PEER) study , comprising a total of 22,550 person -years, it was concluded that s ymptoms associated with AD seem to persist well into the second decade of life and likely longer.4 At ever y age, more than 80% of PEER study subjects had s ymptoms of AD and/or were using medication to treat their AD. Of the currentl y available therapies, none offers a cure; therefore, the main aims of existing treatments are to reduce the occurrence of acute f lares, to increase the time between relapses, and to reduce pruritus and the resulting sleep disturbance.5,6 Non- medicated topical therapies include emollients. Medi cated t opical therapy for moderate to severe AD include topical corticosteroids (TCS) (eg, betamethasone, clobetasol, fluocinonide), topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) (eg, pimecrolimus, tacrolimus), and coal tarpreparations. TCS are limited in terms o f the treatment duration (eg, corticosteroid use is limited to 2 to 4 weeks) and the body region of treatment, due to consistent skin toxicities, as well as having risks associated with their broad immunosuppressive actions. TCI have a limited role as a s econd -line treatment, due to their limitations in the duration and the bod y region of treatment, inhibition of tumor surveillance in the skin, and safet y concerns with malignancies. Crisaborole was approved as a medicated topical therapy in December 2016 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in patients with mild to moderate AD. Additional treatments generall y reserved for severe AD include phototherapy (eg, ultraviolet A light [UVA] with or without psoralen, ultraviolet B light [UVB] narrowba nd or broadband) and s ystemic agents (eg, corticosteroids, cy closporine, recombinant interferon gamma (IFN -), mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate [MTX], azathioprine, intravenous immunoglobulin).7 There are a l imited number of approved s ystemic treatments for moderate to severe AD and in the USA, the only approved s ystemic drugs are corticosteroids and dupilumab. Dupilumab, an injectable human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin (IL) - 4 and -13, was appro ved by the FDA in March 2017 and received marketing authorization in Europe in September 2017, for the treatment of moderate to severe AD. Treatment with sy stemic corticosteroids has known and well documented adverse effects. Treatment with dupilumab hasthe risk of injection site reactions, allergic reactions, ey e and ey elid inflammations and cold sores. Another potential limitation of dupilumab is the possibility for the development"
18,page_18,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 19of antidrug antibodies, which may result in loss of efficacy over time and the development of safet y concerns such as serum sickness -like reactions. Furthermore, dupilumab is delivered via subcutaneous injection, which may not be a method of administration tolerated well by all patients. During a 1 -year, randomized, double -blinded study with dupilumab, in the dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (marketed maintenance dose) plus TCS group, the estimated difference from placebo of the Investigator's Global Assessment ( IGA)response rate and Eczema Area and Severity Index ( EASI )-75 response rate w ere 26% and 46%, respectivel y. The placebo response rate for IGA and EASI -75 was 12% and 23%, respectivel y .8 The development of potential treatments with further improvements in efficacy remains desirable. In Europe, cy closporine is approved for use in patients with severe AD when s ystemic therapy is required. C yclosporine use is associated with several undesirable side effects and due to its narrow therapeutic index, occasional therapeutic dru g monitoring is recommended. Known adverse effects include infections, renal toxicity , hepatotoxicity , skin malignancies, l ymphoma and other malignancies. The predominant unmet medical need is for an oral therap y with an acceptable safety profile, for lo ng-term use, which is effective for moderate to severe AD. Patients with moderate to severe AD require other sy stemic treatment options bey ond those which are currently approved. PF-04965842 is an oral tablet, providing a more convenient route of administration compared with the subcutaneous injection required for dupilumab and so it does not have the potential risk of injection site reactions. Unlike dupilumab, PF - 04965842 is a small molecule and there is no anticipated immunogenicit y for PF -04965842, a nd so it is unlikely to generate antidrug antibodies. Key cytokines implicated in the pathophy siology of AD include IL-4,IL-5,IL-13,IL-31, and IFN -, and require Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) for signal transduction; this suggests that selective JAK1 inhibitors that modulate the activity ofthese cytokines represent a compelling approach to the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases such as AD.8 PF-04965842 is an orall y bioavailable small molecule that selectivel y inhibits JAK1 by blocking the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site. PF -04965842 has a high degree of selectivity in vitro against other kinases: 28- fold selectivity over JAK2, >340 -fold over JAK3 and 43 -fold over tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), as well as a good selectivit yprofile over the broader range of human kinases. The selective inhibition of JAK1 will lead to modulation of multiple cy tokine pathway s involved in the pathophy siology of AD, including IL-4,IL-5,IL-13, IL -31 and IFN -. Data from a Pha se2b proof of concept (POC) study (B7451006) that evaluated subjects with moderate to severe AD have shown positive efficacy , as well as an acceptable safet y profile, sufficient to support further clinical development in a larger Phase 3 program."

This study will provide a direct comparison of both doses of PF -04965842 with dupilumab in terms of pruritus relief. This study will also provide data, which will estimate the relative efficacy of both doses of PF -04965842 and dupilumab. The treatment duration is 20 weeks. A total of approximately 700 subjects will be enrolled from approximately 270sites globall y. There is a primary efficacy assessment at Week 12, and key secondary efficacy assessments at Week 2 and Week 16. Efficacy and safet y endpoints will be assess ed throughout the entire study . After providing informed consent, subjects will be assessed for stud y eligibility at the screening visit. Subjects will undergo screening within 28 days prior to randomization. During the screening period, sy stemic treatments and medicated topical therapy for AD will be washed out, as applicable, according to el igibility requirements. Eligible subjects must have a documented history , within 6 months of the screening visit, of inadequate response to treatment with medicated topical therap y for at least 4 weeks, or must have required s ystemic therapies for control of their disease. Eligible subjects must meet the eligibility criteria at both screening and baseline. In addition, subjects are required to use non -medicated topical therap y (ie, emollients) at least twice dail y for the last 7 days prior to Day 1 and m ust also be willing and able to use standardized background topical therap y, as per protocol guidelines, throughout the duration of the study . Subjects may be re -screened once if they fail the screening evaluation for reasons related to incidental transit ory conditions . Subjects for whom screen failure is related to failing the dise ase severit y (including extent of disease) inclusion criterion and who subsequently experience worsening AD, which in the investigator’s judgement would make them eligible for participation, may be considered for re-screening. Such cases should be discussed with the Pfizer Medical Monitor (or designee) to determine if re - screening is appropriate. Subjects who continue to meet eligibility criteria at baseline will undergo Day 1 assessments and be randomized in a 4:4:4:1:1 ratio to receive 10 0mg or 200 mg of PF -04965842 QD with dupilumab -matching placebo administered every other week, dupilumab 300 mg administered every other w eek (with a loading dose of 600 mg at baseline) with PF-04965842-matching placebo administered QD, or one of 2 sequen ces of PF- 04965842- matching placebo administered QD with dupilumab -matching placebo administered every other week from Day 1, for 16 weeks followed b y either 100 mg or 200mg of PF -04965842 QD . Investigators, subjects, and the sponsor study team will be blinded as to treatment group. The total treatment period is 20 weeks. The first part of this treatment period consists of a 16-week randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, double -dummy treatment period with subjects receiving both injectable and oral investigational product. The randomization and double -blind will be maintained during the final 4 weeks of the treatment period, but subjects will only receive oral investigational product. At Week 16 in the treatment period, all"
23,page_23,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 24subjects will cease injectable dupilumab or its matching placebo. This is to facilitate the washout of dupilumab (for a total of 6 weeks; as the final dose of dupilumab or its matching placebo is administered at W eek14) prior to eligible subjects entering the long- term extension study , in which all subjects will receive PF -04965842 active treatment. As, following Week 16, data for the primary and key secondary efficacy assessments will have alread y been obtained, subjects previously receiving onl y placebo will receive PF -04965842 100mg or 200 mg QD as per their randomized allocation. Subjects previously receiving PF-04965842 100 mg or 200 mg QD will continue on their respective dose. Subjects previously receivi ng dupilumab will continue to take oral placebo. These alterations to study treatment will all be conducted while maintaining the blind when re -issuing oral investigational product to all subjects at the Week 16 time point. Eligible subjects completing t he entire 20- week treatment period of the study will have the option to enter a long -term extension (LTE) study, B7451015, in which all subjects will receive PF -04965842 active treatment.

Statistical Methods A total sample of 700 subjects, with 200 randomized to PF -04965842 200 m g QD, 200subjects randomized to PF -04965842 100 mg QD, 200 subjects randomized to dupilumab and 50 subjects each randomized to two sequences of matching placebo for 16weeks followed b y (a) PF -04965842 100 mg QD and by (b) PF -04965842 200 mgQD (4:4:4:1:1 randomization) is planned. The two placebo sequences will be combined for purposes of analy ses at all visits up to and including Week 16, which will result in a 2:2:2:1 randomization ratio. This will provide at least 96% power to detect a difference of at least 20% in IGA response rate between either dose of PF -04965842 and placebo, assuming the placebo response rate is 12% at Week 12. This will also provide at least 99% power to detect a difference of at least 30% in EASI -75 response rate between eithe r dose of PF-04965842 and placebo, assuming the placebo response rate is 23% at Week 12. Both co -primary endpoints must achieve statistical significance to meet the primary objective. In addition, this sample size will also provide at least 92% power to de tect a difference of at least 15% in the proportion of subjects with a 4points improvement in the severit y of Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS )between PF -04965842 and dupilumab, assuming the dupilumab response rate is 18% at Week 2. The T ype-I error rate is set at 5% (two -sided). The family wise Ty pe-I error rate (for testing the co- primary and key secondary endpoints) will be strongl y controlled at 5% using a closed-testing method based on a sequential, iterative Bonferroni- type approach. This is described in further detail in Section 9.2.2 of the protocol and in the statistical anal ysis plan (SAP). The study has been sized to help gain sufficient safety data to be able to effectivel y evaluate the benefit -risk of PF -04965842 in conjunction with the other studies in the clinical development program, therefore the power for the co -primary endpoints is relatively high. This sample size will also help ensure adequate power is maintained for testing all the co-primary and key secondary endpoints for both doses of PF -04965842 via the multiple testing procedure. For analy sis of the co- primary endpoints, the (Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel) test adjusted by baseline disease severit y group (moderate and severe) will be use d. If a subject withdraws from the study , then this subject will be counted as a non-responder for endpoints after withdrawal."

The Janus kinase (JAK) family , including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and ty rosine kinase 2 (TYK2), is a group of cy toplasmic ty rosine kinases that mediate signal transduction via interactions with Ty pe1 and Ty pe2 cytokine receptors critical for leukocy te activation, proliferation, survival and function. Cy tokine receptors demonstrate restricted association with JAKs such that different receptors or receptor classes preferentially utilize a given JAK dimer or trimer combination to transduce their signal. JAK1 pairs with JAK3 to mediate -common cy tokine signaling and also with JAK2 or TYK2 to transmit the signals of additional cy tokines important in inflammation and immune responses including interleukin (IL) -4, -5, -6, -13, - 21, -31, interferon gamma (IFN- ), and interferon alpha (IFN -). JAK2 homodimers are critical for the signaling of hematopoietic cy tokines and hormones including ery thropoietin (EPO), thrombopoietin (TPO), IL -3, granulocy te-macrophage colon y-stimulating factor (GM -CSF) and prolactin. Key cytokines implicated in the pathophy siology of AD include IL-4,IL-5,IL-13,IL-31, and IFN -,andrequire JAK1 for signal transduction; this suggests that selective JAK1 inhibitors that modulate the activity ofthesecytokines represent a compelling approach to the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases such as AD.9 IL-12 and IL -23 are dependent on TYK2 and JAK2 for transmitting their signals. Following cytokine activat ion, receptor -associated JAKs are phosphory lated and in turn phosphory late specific sites on the receptor intracellular domain. Phosphory lation of specific sites on the intracellular domain of the receptor allows for the recruitment of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) that can subsequently be phosphory lated by JAKs. Phosphory lated STAT molecules are released from the receptor, translocate to the nucleus where they bind to specific sites on the deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) a nd regu late gene transcription. PF-04965842 is an orall y bioavailable small molecule that selectivel y inhibits JAK1 by blocking the ATP binding site. PF- 04965842 has a high degree of selectivity in vitro against other kinases: 28 -fold selectivity over JAK2, >340 -fold over JAK3 and 43- fold over TYK2, as well as a good selectivity profile over the broader range of human kinases. The selective inhibition of JAK1 will lead to modulation of multiple cy tokine pathway s involved in the pathophy siology of AD, including IL-4,IL-5, IL -13, IL -31 and IFN -. Data from a Phase 2b proof of concept (POC) study (B7451006) that evaluated subjects with moderate to severe AD have shown positive efficacy , as well as an acceptable safet y profile, sufficient to support further clinica l development in a larger Phase 3 program."

Drug Development and Rationale PF-04965842 is being developed as an oral treatment for patients with moderate to severe AD based on its mechanism of action, and the clinical results obtain ed in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. The clinical development program for PF -04965842 includes healthy volunteers, subjects with psoriasi s and subjects with AD. Additional information for this compound may be found in the single reference safet y document (S RSD), which for this study is the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). The SRSD for dupilumab is the Unite d States Package Insert (USPI). 1.2.2. Atopic Dermatitis Atopic dermatitis, also known as atopic eczema, is a common, chronic, inflammatory skin disorder characterized by flaky skin lesions, intense pruritus, and a general deterioration in the quality of life. Over the past 50 years, AD has become more prevalent, especiall y in industrialized, temperate countries such as the US.1,2 AD is one of the most common, chronic, relapsing childhood dermatoses, impacting 15 -30% of all children in the US and many have disease that persists into adulthood with a lifetime prevalence of those affected in childhood reported to be 34%.3 Earlier reports indicated that, in up to 70% of cases, the disease greatly improves or resolves by late childhood, however more recent findings suggest that disease a ctivity remains manifest for a prolonged period of time. Based on a total of 7157 patients enrolled in the Pediatric Eczema Elective Registry (PEER) study , comprising a total of 22,550 person -years, it was concluded that sy mptoms associated with AD seem to persist well into the second decade of life and likely longer.4 At every age, more than 80% of PEER study subjects had sy mptoms of AD and/or were using medication to treat their AD. In 833 AD patients who we re aged 20 years or older when they visited the clinic and 45 years or older when they responded to a follow -up questionnaire, 59% responded that they had defined persistent AD at some time during the last 12 months.10 The majority of studies conducted across multiple age groups suggest a continued decrease in prevalence with older age.11 Adult- onset AD does also occur, though it is less common. The prevalence of AD in adults is estimated to be 10 %.12Recent studies have indicated that adults with AD are more likely to smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, and have a sedentary lifesty le, potentiall y associated with increased co morbidities, such as asthma and cardiovascular disease.13 Although great strides have been made in understanding the causes, the complex pathophy siology of AD is still not completely understood. It has been es tablished that the pathophy siology of AD includes a defective skin barrier function, allergic responses, defective antimicrobial immune defense, and a genetic predisposition. The predominant symptom of AD, pruritus and the resulting scratching, t ypicall y sets off an amplification cycle of atopic skin inflammation. Activation of T lymphocy tes, dendritic cells, macrophages, keratinocytes, mast cells, and eosinophils results in a release of numerous"
35,page_35,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 36pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. This amplification cy cle sustains the inflammatory responses characteristic of the AD lesions.14 Acute AD lesions have been associated with the Ty pe2 helper T cell (TH2) phenoty pe, showing dominance of IL -4, -5, -13, and - 31 secretion.8,14,15Recent research showed that a small increase of Ty pe1 helper T cell (TH1)- associated genes has been also detected in acute phase.16 While IL -4-producing TH2 cells may drive the development of atopic skin lesions, chronic lesions show either the coexistence of both IL - 4-producing TH2 and IFN--producing TH1 cells or TH1 dominance.14 This coexistence of TH2 and TH1 responses or TH1 dominance is more likely to be the underly ing immunopathology in adult patients who have had AD chronicall y or intermittently since chil dhood. Recent evidence also supports IL -31’s role in pruritus and inflammation in AD.8,15 Non- medicated topical therapies include emollients. Medicated t opical t herapies for moderate to severe AD include TCS (eg, betamethasone, clobetasol, fluocinonide), TCI (eg,pimecrolimus, tacrolimus), and coal tar preparations. TCS are limited in terms of the treatment duration (eg, corticosteroid use is limited to 2 to 4 weeks ) and the body region of treatment, due to consistent skin toxicities, as well as having risks associated with their broad immunosuppressive actions. TCI have a limited role as a second line treatment, due to their limitations in terms of the duration of treatment and the body region of treatment, inhibition of tumor surveillance in the skin, and safety concerns with malignancies. Crisaborole was approved as a medicated topical therap yin December 2016 by the FDA for use in patients with mild to moderate AD. Additional treatments generall y reserved for severe AD include phototherap y (eg, ultraviolet Alight [UVA] with or without psoralen, ultraviolet Blight [UVB] narrowband or broadband) and s ystemic agents (eg, corticosteroids, cy closporine, recombinant IFN-, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate [MTX], azathioprine, intravenous immunoglobulin).4 Of the currently available therapies, none offers a cure; therefore, the main aims of existing treatments are to re duce the occurrence of acute flares, to increase the time between relapses, reduce pruritus and the resulting sleep disturbance.5,6 There are a limited number of app roved s ystemic treatments for moderate to severe AD, and in the USA, the only approved s ystemic drugs are corticosteroids and dupilumab. Dupilumab, an injectable human monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin (IL) - 4 and -13, was approved b y the FDA in M arch 2017 and received marketing authorization in Europe in September 2017, for the treatment of moderate to severe AD. Treatment with sy stemic corticosteroids has known and well documented adverse effects. Treatment with dupilumab has the risk of inject ion site reactions, allergic reactions, ey e and ey elid inflammations and cold sores. Another potential limitation of dupilumab is the possibility for development of antidrug antibodies, which may result in loss of efficacy over time and the development of safet y concerns such as serum sickness -like reactions. Furthermore, dupilumab is delivered via subcutaneous injection, which may not be a method of administration tolerated well by all patients. During a 1- year, randomized, double -blinded study with dupilumab, in the dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks (marketed maintenance dose) plus TCS group, the estimated difference from placebo of the IGA response rate and EASI-75 response rate were"
36,page_36,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 3726% and 46%, respectively . The placebo response rate for IGA and EASI -75 was 12% and 23%, respectively .8 The development of potential treatments with further improvements to efficacy remains desirable. In Europe, cy closporine is approved for use in patients with severe AD when s ystemic therapy is required. C yclosporine use is associated with several undesirable side effects and due to its narrow therapeutic index, occasional therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended. Known adverse effects include infections, renal toxicity , hepatotoxicity , skin malignancies, l ymphoma and other malignancies. The predominant unmet medical need is for an oral therap y with an acceptable safety profile, for long -term use, which is effective for moderate to severe AD. Patients with moderate to severe AD require other sy stemic treatment options bey ond those which are currently approved. Currently available therapies for the treatment of AD have multiple limitations. The medicated topical therapies have drawbacks related to the duration of use due to the potential for local and s ystemic side effects (eg, corticosteroid use is limited to 2 to 4 weeks) and to the body regions of use (eg, mid -high potency corticosteroids are not approved for use on the face and/or intertriginous areas). For AD patients not responding to medicated topical therapies and phototherapy , on- and off -label use of sy stemic agents, which include oral corticosteroids or oral immunosuppressants, remain the last viable treatment option. Systemic therapy options are associated with p otentially severe adverse effects and require careful monitoring. The risk of toxicity and side effects remain a concern when s ystemic agents are used. For these reasons, the use of these agents is limited to short courses or intermittent therapy . PF- 04965842 is an oral tablet, a more convenient route of administration compared with subcutaneous injection required for dupilumab and so it does not have the potential risk of injection site reactions. Unlike dupilumab, PF -04965842 is a small molecule and th ere is no anticipated immunogenicity for PF -04965842, and so it is unlikely to generate antidrug antibodies . As mentioned above, a variet y of pro -inflammatory cytokines such as IL -4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-31 and IFN -, have been suggested to have a role in the p athogenesis of AD. Man y of these pathogenic cy tokines use the JAK1 for signaling. Therefore, JAK1 is an attractive therapeutic target for AD. 1.2.3. Non-Clinical and Phase 1 Data Data from nonclinical and Phase 1 programs supports the planned clinical trials wi th PF-04965842 and further information is in the current version of the IB."

Phase 2b in AD (B7451006) B7451006 was a Phase 2b proof -of-concept trial in adults (ages 18-75) with moderate to severe AD investigating doses of 10, 30, 100, and 200 mg PF - 04965842 or placebo taken once dail y for up to 12 weeks. The primary endpoint in this study was the proportion of subjects achieving an IGA score of clear (0), or almost clear (1), and a 2-point improvement from baseline at Week 12. The baseline was defined as the IGA score on Day 1 pre -dose. At Week 12, IGA response rates of PF -04965842 100 mg and 200 mg dose groups were significantl y greater than placebo in patients with moderate to severe AD. The IGA response rates of the 200 mg and 100 mg groups were 44.5 % and 27.8%, respectively. The IGA response rate in the placebo group was 6.3% and the estimated differences from placebo in the 200 mg and 100 mg groups were 38.2% (P=0.0032) and 21.5% (P=0.0184), respectively . The percent change from baseline (% CFB) i n EASI scores at Week 12 were significantly higher for both the 200 mg and 100 mg groups compared to placebo. The estimated percent change from baseline in EASI score was -35.2% in the placebo group, -82.6% in the 200 mg group and -59.0% in the 100 mg gro up. At Week 12, the proportion of subjects achieving EASI -75 response was 15.6% in the placebo group, 63.7% in the 200 mg group and 41.6% in the 100 mg group. The difference from placebo was 41.8% (P <0.0001) for the 200 mg group and 26.0% (P=0.0043) in t he 100 mg group. At Day 15, the proportion of response based on achieving at least 4 points improvement in the severity of Pruritus NRS from baseline (Pruritus NRS 4) of PF -04965842 100 mg and 200 mg dose groups was greater than placebo. The estimated pro portion of Pruritus NRS 4 responses at Day 15 were 69.8%, 41.1% and 15.7% for 200 mg, 100 mg and placebo groups, respectivel y. PF-04965842 demonstrated a rapid onset of action. I n the 200 mg group, IGA and EASI scores improved until Week4 and W eek6, respectively , and maintained their effect through 12 weeks of treatment. Response rates at Week 12 for the 10 mg and 30 mg groups were not significantl y different from placebo. A key differentiating feature for the JAK1 inhibitor is rapid resolution of itch associated with AD. Significant separation from placebo was achieved for the Pruritus NRS score as earl y as 2 days after initiation of treatment for the 200mg dose group. Overall, the results demonstrated dose -dependent increases in responses at Week 12for key efficacy endpoints (IGA, EASI and Pruritus NRS score). PF-04965842 appeared generall y safe and well tolerated in this study. Overall, adverse events ( AE)s and Serious Adverse Events (SAE )s were numericall y higher in subjects receiving PF -04965842 compared to placebo, but did not appear to increase with dose. The most common AEs were in the infections and infestations, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and gastrointestinal disorders s ystem organ class (SOC), and the majority of the AEs were m ild. There were 2 cases of herpes zoster, one in the 10 mg group (not treatment related), and one in the 30 mg group (treatment related). There were dose -dependent decreases in platelet counts observed in the study , which plateaued at Week 4. Further details of the clinical Phase 2 development program can be found in the IB."

Median T maxat doses of 400 mg and 800mg were 1.5 and 3.9 hours, respectively , which indicated the slower absorption compared to lower doses. PF -04965842 showed a monopha sic decline at dose <100 mg with biphasic profiles at doses 100mg. Observed peak plasma PF -04965842 concentrations (Cmax) following the single- dose administration generall y increased in proportion to the dose from 3 mg to 800 mg. In contrast, both area under the plasma concentration- time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC inf) and area under the plasma concentration time profile from time zero to the last quantifiable concentration (AUC last) were dose proportional in the range of 3 mg to 200mg, while a greater than proportional increase was observed at doses of 400 and 800 mg. The arithmetic mean terminal phase half -life (t ½) was 1.9 to 4.9hours. Following QD administration over the dose range 30 mg to 400 mg and 100 mg and 200mgtwice a day (BID) for 10 days, median T maxranged between 0.50 to 0.77 hours (B7451001). After attainment of C max, the disposition of PF- 04965842 was consistent with that observed following single -dose administration, showing a biphasic decline following all but the lowest dose and an arithmetic mean terminal phase t ½between 2.8 to 5.0 hours. Although C maxgenerally increased in proportion to the dose up to 100 mg given twice dail y (BID), it increased more than the dose increased at 400 mg QD and 200 mg BID. The same trend was also observed for area under the plasma concentration- time curve (AUC tau) over the dosing interval (tau =12 or 24 hours). The observed accumulation ratio (R ac) following 200mg BID was 2.0 and 2.5 for AUC tauand C max, respectivel y. R acwas 1.1 to 1.5 at other doses. Therefore, the results showed that drug concentration accumulation is minimal after repeated oral administration at lower doses consistent with the prediction from t ½. Urinary recovery of PF -04965842 was low, with <5% of the dose recovered unchanged in urine across all doses and regimens in all cohorts. At a single 800 mg dose, the geometric mean percent coefficient of variation (%CV) Cmax(ng/mL) was similar in Western (n=5; 3819 (26)) and Japanese subjects (n=10; 3660 (48)). However, geometric mean AUC inf(ng*hr/mL) was 26% higher in Western subjects (n=5; 27540 (35)) than that observed in Japanese subjects (n=9; 21860 (43)) (B7451001). Geometric mean (%CV) C maxand AUC taufollowing multiple -dose administration of 20 0mgBID were 17% and 56% higher, respectively , in the Western subjects (n=5) than in Japanese subjects (n=6). Co-administration of 400 mg (4 x 100 mg) of the tablet with food resulted in equivalent geometric mean AUC infbetween fasted and fed conditions and a small mean decrease (<5%) in C max. The magnitude of decrease in C maxwas not considered to be clinically important. Overall, PF -04965842 can be administered with or without food."

Population Pharmacokinetics Population pharmacokinetics (PK) analysiswas conducted by pooling data from two Phase 1 studies (B7451001, first -in-human study , and B7451004, relative bioavailability study ) in healthy subjects and the proof -of-concept study (B7451006) in AD patients. A total of 2465 PK observations from 354 subjects were included in the anal ysis and the data were described using a 2 compartment model with first -order absorption. The estimates of systemic clearance/fraction of dose absorbed (CL/F) and volume of distribution/fraction absorbed (V/F) were 44.8 L/hr and 147 L with inter individual variability (IIV) values of63% and 35% (expressed as % CV) respectively . Clearance (CL/F) of AD patients was estimated to be ~38% lower than that of health y subjects; residual variability was estimated to be higher in A D patients compared to the value in healthy subjects (66% vs. 36% CV). Baseline bod y weight, race, age and sex were tested as covariates on clearance and did not appear to impact the PK o f PF-04965842. 1.4.Summary of Benefits and Risks There was clinicall y me aningful benefit demonstrated in the Phase 2b Proof of Concept study in adult patients with moderate to severe AD. The potential risks of treatment include those that were noted in Phase 2b and/ or those based on the pharmacology of JAK inhibitors and include viral reactivation, serious and opportunistic infections, hematopoietic effects (including reduced platelet count), and malignancy and immunoproliferative disorders Further information is available in the IB. Appropriate risk evaluation and mitigatio n strategies have been incorporated into this protocol. Overall, there is a favorable benefit- risk profile to support the continued development into Phase 3 of PF -04965842 in the treatment of patients, 12 years of age and older, with AD for both the 100 mgand 200 mg dose. 1.5.Dose Selection Rationale Dose selection for Phase 3 was based on efficacy and safety of PF-04965842 from a dose-ranging Phase 2b study , B7451006 that evaluated a 20 -fold dose range (10 mg to 200mgQD) in adult subjects with AD. The 200 mgQD dose as a monotherapy is expected to provide efficacy similar to that of currently approved sy stemic treatments (eg cy closporine, systemic corticosteroids and dupilumab) in moderate to severe AD, based on dose -response modeling of IGA response in the Phase 2 study , and was therefore selected as the high dose for evaluation in Phase 3 studies. Additionally , adose of 100 mg QD was selected for Phase 3 evaluation . The 100 mg dose is expected to differentiate from the higher dose in terms of efficacy , safety and sy stemic exposure . In this study , the efficacy and safet y of the 100mg dose will be evaluated in combination with background topical therapy . Both 100mg and 200 mgQD doses demonstrated acceptable safet y and tolerability in the Phase 2 study . Further details are available in the IB. The dosing regimen of dupilumab used in the study will be based on the approved USPI (reference)."

This study will provide a direct comparison of both doses of PF -04965842 with dupilumab in terms of pruritus relief. This study will also provide data which will estimate the relative efficacy of both doses of PF -04965842 and dupilumab. The treatment duration is 20 weeks. A total of approximately 700 subjects will be enrolled from approximately 270 sites globall y. There is a primary efficacy assessment at Week 12, and key secondary efficacy assessments at Week 2 and Week 16. Efficacy and safet y endpoints will be asse ssed throughout the entire study .A study design schematic is presented in Figure 1. Figure 1.Study Design Schematic aAt Week 2 and Week 16, key secondary endpoints are measured. bAt Week 12, prim ary endpoints are measured. cAt Week 20, eligible subjects will enter the B7451015 long -term extension study; ineligible subjects w ill instead enter the 4 -week off- treatm ent follow -up period in B7451029. Note: Standardized background topical therapy must be used as per protocol guidelines throughout the study . After providing informed consent, subjects will be assessed for stud y eligibility at the screening visit. Subjects will undergo screening within 28 days prior to randomization. During the screening period, sy stemic treatments and medicated topical therapy for AD will be washed out, as applicable, according to eligibility requirements. Eligible subjects must have a documented history , within 6 months of the screening visit, of inadequa te response to treatment with medicated topical therap y for at least 4 weeks, or must have required s ystemic therapies for control of their disease. Eligible subjects must meet the eligibility criteria at both screening and baseline. In addition, subject s are required to use non -medicated topical therap y (ie, emollients) at least twice dail y for the last 7 days prior to Day 1 and must also be"

Subjects may be re -screened once if they fail the screening evaluation for reasons related to incidental transitory conditions. Subjects for whom screen failure is related to failing the disease severit y (including extent of disease) inclusion criterion 3and who subsequently experience worsening AD, which in the investigator’s judgement would make them eligible for participation, may be considered for re-screening. Such cases should be discussed with the Pfi zer Medical Monitor (or designee) to determine if re - screening is appropriate. Subjects who continue to meet eligibility criteria at baseline will undergo Day 1 assessments and be randomized in a 4:4:4:1:1 ratio to receive 100 mg or 200 mg of PF -04965842 Q D with dupilumab -matching placebo administered every other week , dupilumab 300 mg administered every other week (with a loading dose of 600 mg at baseline) with PF-04965842-matching placebo administered QD , or one of two sequences of PF- 04965842- matching placebo administered QD with dupilumab -matching placebo administered every other week from Day 1, for 16 weeks followed b y either 100 mg or 200mg of PF -04965842 QD. Investigators, subjects, and the sponsor study team will be blinded as to treatment group. The total treatment period is 20 weeks. The first part of this treatment period consists of a 16-week randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, double -dummy treatment period with subjects receiving both injectable and oral investigational product. The randomization and double - blind will be maintained during the final 4 weeks of the treatment period, but subjects will only receive oral investigational product. At Week 16 in the treatment period, all subjects will cease injectable dupilumab or its ma tching placebo. This is to facilitate the washout of dupilumab (for a total of 6 weeks; as the final dose of dupilumab or its matching placebo is administered at Week 14) prior to eligible subjects entering the long- term extension study , in which all subj ects will receive PF -04965842 active treatment. As, following Week 16, data for the primary and key secondary efficacy assessments will have alread y been obtained, subjects previously receiving only placebo will receive PF -04965842 100mg or 200 mg QD as per their randomized allocation. Subjects previously receiving PF-04965842 100 mg or 200 mg QD will continue on their respective dose. Subjects previously receiving dupilumab will continue to take oral placebo. These alterations to study treatment will all be conducted while maintaining the blind when re -issuing oral investigational product to all subjects at the Week 16 time point. Eligible subjects completing the entire 20 -week treatment period of the study will have the option to enter a long -term extension (LTE) stud y, B7451015. In which all subjects will receive PF -04965842 active treatment. Subjects discontinuing early from treatment, or who are otherwise ineligible for the LTE study, will undergo a 4- week follow -up period in study B7451029."

Highl y effective methods of contraception are those that, al one or in combination, result in a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie, perfect use) and include the following: 1.Established use of hormonal methods of contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (eg, ora l, inserted, injected, implanted, transdermal) provided the subject plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness. 2.Correctl y placed co pper-contai ning intrauterine device (IUD). 3.Male condom or female condom used WI TH a separate spermicide product (ie, foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository ). For countries where spermicide is not available or condom plus spermicide is not accepted as high ly effective contraception, this option is not appropriate. 4.Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the post -vasectom y ejaculate. NOTE : Vasectomized partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) trial participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success."

NOTE: Sexual abstinence, defined as completel y and persistently refraining from all heterosexual intercourse (including during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments) may obviate the need for contraception ONLY if this is the preferred and usual lifesty le of the subject. The contraception check is an opportunity to confirm that contraception, if assigned, is used consistently and correctly . It also facilitates cont inual reassessment of childbearing potential in women. This allows for implementing necessary changes to contraception; for example, investigators may need to ensure alternative contraceptive methods if new concomitant disease contraindicates a selected m ethod of contraception, or if a subject is demonstrably no longer of child bearing status (as per protocol) then they will no longer require contraception. Continual reassessment of contraceptive needs is imperative. For countries in the EU: Highl y effecti ve methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie, perfect use) and include the following: 1. Established use of hormonal methods of contraception as sociated with inhibition of ovulation (eg, oral, inserted, injected, implanted, transdermal) provided the subject plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of tim e to ensure effectiveness. 2.Correctly placed copper -containing intrauterine device (IUD). 3.Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the post -vasectom y ejaculate. NOTE: Vasectomiz ed partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that partner i s the sole sexual partner of the WOCBP trial participant and that the vasectomi zed partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success. 4.Bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral salpingectom y or bilateral tubal occlusive procedure (provided that occlu sion has been confirmed in accordance with the device’s label).

Subject Specific Recommendations It is recommended that all subjects should be up- to-date with respect to standard of care vaccinations (as defined by their country health ministry ) or AD guidelines. Vaccination of subjects with live attenuated vaccines is prohibited within the 6 weeks prior to first dose of investigational product, for the duration of the st udy, and for 6 weeks following completion of the study . 4.4.2.2. Guidance Regarding Household Contact Vaccine - Related Exposure Current routine household contact with children and others who have been vaccinated with live attenuated vaccine s may pose a risk during treatment and for 6 weeks following completion of the study . Some of these vaccines include varicella (“chickenpox”) vaccine, oral polio vaccine, and the inhaled flu vaccine. Following vaccination with live component vaccines, the virus may be shed in bodily fluids, including stool, and there is a potential risk that the virus may be transmitted. General guidelines for immunosuppressed subjects suggest that exposure (through routine contact) should be avoided following vaccination (of others) with these vaccines for the stated time period: a.Varicella or attenuated typhoid fever vaccination for 4 weeks following vaccination; b.Oral polio vaccination for 6 weeks following vaccination; c.Attenuated rotavirus vaccine for 10 days following vaccination ; d. FluMist(intranasal flu vaccine) for 1 week following vaccination ; Subjects should avoid exposure to recently vaccinated or infected persons and contact the investigator promptl y should they develop signs or sy mptoms of infections. 4.4.3. Surgery During the study , no electiv e surgery should occur without first consulting with the Pfizer Medical Monitor or designee. Preferabl y, elective surgery should occur before the study or be delay ed until participation in the study is completed. The Pfizer Medical Monitor or designee sho uld be notified if a subject requires surgery (including dental surgery) during the study to determine whether the subject should discontinue from the study and/or discontinue investigational product prior to the surgical procedure. In general, planned su rgical procedures should not be performed unless the investigational product has been discontinued for at least 28 days (unless otherwise advised by the Pfizer Medical Monitor or designee). The Pfizer Medical Monitor or designee should be notified as soon as possible if a subject undergoes a surgical procedure without first informing the stud y staff."
58,page_58,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 594.5.Sponsor’s Qualified Medical Personnel The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the study is documented in the study contact list located in the coordinator’s manual and in the study portal. To facilitate access to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on stud y-related medical questions or problems, subjects are provided with a contact card. The contact card co ntains, at a minimum, protocol and investigational product identifiers, subject study numbers, contact information for the investigator site, and contact details for a contact center in the event that the investigator site staff cannot be reached to provid e advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the subject’s participation in the study . The contact number can also be used by investigator staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the established communication pathway s between the investigator site and the study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the established communication p athway s between the investigator site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the stud y. The contact number is not intended for use by the subject directly, and if a subject calls that number, he or she will be directed back to the investigator site. 5.STUDY TREATMENTS The study treatments are as follows: Orally administered 100 mg of PF -04965842 QD with dupilumab -matching placebo administered b y subcutaneous injection every other week (two injections at baseline ; to dummy the loading dose) from Day 1 to Week 16, followed b y orall y administered 100mg of PF -04965842 QD until Week 20. Orally administered 200 mg of PF -04965842 QD with dupilumab -matching placebo administered b y subcutaneous injection every other week (two injections at baseline; to dummy the loading dose) from Day 1 to Week 16, followed b y orall y administered 200mg of PF -04965842 QD until Week 20. Dupilumab 300 mg administered every other week (with a loading dose of 600 mg at baseline) with PF -04965842- matching orall y administered placebo QD from Day 1 to Week 16, followed b y PF- 04965842- matching orally administered placebo QD until Week 20. PF- 04965842 -matching orally administered placebo QD with dupilumab -matching subcutaneousl y injected placebo administered every other week (two injections at baseline; to dummy the loading dose) from Day 1 to Week 16 followed by orally administered 100 mg of PF -04965842 QD until Week 20."

For the purposes of this study , and per International Council for Harmonisation (I CH) guidelines, in vestigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference/comparator in a clinical trial, including a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated or packag ed) in a way different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (I CH E6 1.33). 5.1.Allocation to Treatment Allocation of subjects to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an I nteractive Response Technology (IRT) sy stem. The site personnel (study coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, protocol number, the subject number and the date of birth of the subject. The site personnel will then be provided with a treatment assignment and dispensable unit (DU) or container number when investigational product is being supplied via the I RT. The I RT s ystem will provide a confirmation report containing the subject number and DU or container number assigned. The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. There is a 24 hour a day , 365 days a year IRT help desk available for an y questions or issues. The study specific IRT reference manual will provide the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT. NOTE : The IRT is the source of the subject number. The IRT s ystem will provide the subject number at the end of the first IRT subject transaction. 5.2.Breaking the Blind Investigators, subjects and the sponsor study team will be blinded as to treatment group. At each site, an unblinded administrator/trainer will administer the first dose of dupilumab or its matching placebo to train the subject (or caregiver, if applicable) in proper injection technique. At all times, treatment and randomization information will be kept confidential and will not be released to the investigator, the study staff, or the sponsor’s study team until following the conclusion of the study , with the excep tion described in this section."
60,page_60,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 61At the initiation of the study , the study site will be instructed on procedures for breaking the blind. Blinding codes should only be broken in emergency situations for reasons of su bject safet y. The investigator is responsible for, and may break the blind for safety reasons, where the knowledge of actual treatment is essential for the further management of the subject. The method will be an electronic process. When the blind for a subject has been broken, the reason must be full y documented and entered on the Case Report Form (CRF). Whenever possible, the investigator should contact Pfizer before breaking the blind. If the blind is broken, the investigator should promptly inform the Pfizer Clinician or Medical Monitor. The subject for whom the blind has been broken will be discontinued from the study and undergo the earl y termination (ET) procedures. 5.3. Subject Compliance There are viscosit y differences between dupilumab and the matched placebo, and as such there is a potential for functional unblinding of the administrator/trainer; who may notice the difference in viscosit y and/or may have previous experience administering dupilumab. Although no administrator/trainer will know the treatment allocation of subjects, as a risk mitigation against functional unblinding affecting study integrit y this administrator/trainer will only administer injectable investigational product (I P), or observe/train subjects administering injectable IP, w ill be isolated from all other study activities, and will be treated as if unblind. Throughout the protocol, these individuals will be referred to as ""unblinded administrator/trainer"" in order to make this clear distinction from other site personnel. When investigational product is administered at the research facility , it will be administered under the supervision of the unblinded administrator/trainer onl y. From the Day 1 visit onward, subjects will be dispensed PF- 04965842 or PF -04965842- matching place bo to take home with them for self -administration on non -study visit day s. Subjects will be dispensed dupilumab or dupilumab -matching placebo at the Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8 and Week 12 visits for self -administration (or administration by a caregiver , if applicable) at the site. Subjects will also be dispensed dupilumab or dupilumab- matching placebo at Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12 visits to take home with them for self -administration (or administration by a caregiver, if applicable) at Week 6, Week 10, and Week 14, respectivel y. If the subject is unwilling/unable to self -administer the injectable investigational product or arrange for a caregiver to administer the injectable investigational product, then it is permissible for site to arrange for the s ubject to return to the site for administration by the unblinded trainer/administrator. Subjects will be directed to bring an y used and unused syringe cartons to visits following administration at home. Study sites will provide subjects with a sharps con tainer for disposal of used s yringes. Subjects will return this sharps container to the stud y site at the final visit for disposal. Subjects will be issued an electronic dosing diary (eDiary ) and will be educated to record the time of their dosing, once they have taken the investigational product. Subjects will also use the eDiary to record their daily use of standardized background topical therapy for the treatment of AD, as required and as per protocol guidelines in Section 5.9.1, beginning at screening through the EOS visit."
61,page_61,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 62Compliance with the dosing of investigational product will be monitored and verified b y delegated site personnel through a combination of observed invest igational product administration at study visits, the accounting of unused investigational product returned b y the subject at the stud y visits, review of the dosing diary, and discussion with the subject, which will be documented in the source documents. Investigational product should be administered in the morning. Subjects should be instructed that if an oral dose is inadvertently missed then it should be taken as soon as remembered, but not within 12 hours of the next scheduled dose. If an injectable d ose is missed, subjects (or caregivers, if applicable) should be instructed to administer the injection within 7 days from the missed dose and then resume the subject’s original schedule. If the missed dose is not administered within 7 days, subjects (or caregivers, if applicable) should be instructed to wait until the next dose on the original schedule. Investigational product may be temporarily withheld for a maximum of 14 days at investigator's discretion due to abnormal laboratory tests or adverse even t. See Appendix 4 for further guidance on temporary withholding of investigational product . Doses not taken for the reasons mentioned above do not constitute protocol deviations or medication errors and should not be considered dosing errors, but should be noted in the dosing log with the reason for reduced drug consumption. Other than for the above reasons, the following compliance cases will be considered medication errors and will be discussed with the spons or for possible withdrawal from the study : Subjects interrupting oral investigational product for more than 4 consecutive day s or for a total of mo re than 7 days between visits; Subjects administering >8 tablets in one day or administering 4table ts/day for 4consecutive day s; Missed dose of injectable investigational product is not administered within 7 days of the originall y scheduled dose; Subjects administering >1 prefilled s yringe every 2 weeks, with the exception of the initial loading dose of two prefilled syringes on Day 1; Subjects who have an overall compliance of <80% or >120% between visits. Compliance with background topical therap y guidelines inSection 5.9.1 willbe monitored and verified b y delegated site personnel through a combination of review of the electronic diary , and discussion with the subject, which will be documented in the source documents."
62,page_62,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 63Any deviation from protocol specified dosing of investigational product or pr otocol specified guideline concerning background topical medication should be recorded as a protocol deviation and the investigator or designee is to counsel the subject and ensure steps are taken to improve compliance. In addition, if the compliance deviation reaches the thresholds defined above, it should also be recorded as a medication error ( see Section 8.4.4). 5.4.Investigational Product Supplies 5.4.1. Dosage Form(s) and Packaging Blinded PF - 04965842 and its matched placebo will be provided as 100 mg tablets for oral administration. The 100 mg tablets and their matching placebos will be supplied in separate bottles and labeled according to local regulatory requirements. When received by the pharm acy, PF-04965842 and matching placebo will be in containers that will sufficiently blind all site staff to content within the bottles (ie, active versus placebo). Blinded active comparator (dupilumab) will be provided as 300 mg/2 mL prefilled s yringes for subcutaneous injection. Dupilumab -matching placebo will also be provided as prefilled syringes for subcutaneous injection. The dupilumab and matching placebo sy ringes will be labeled according to local regulatory requirements, and when received by the ph armacy will be in containers that will sufficiently blind all site staff to content within the sy ringes. 5.4.2. Preparation and Dispensing The investigational product should be dispensed using a drug management sy stem at each dispensing visit. A qualified staff member will dispense the investigational product via unique container numbers in quantities appropriate for the study visit schedule. The subject (or caregiver, if applicable) should be instructed to maintain the product in the containers provided through out the course of dosing and return the containers to th e site at the next study visit. 5.5.Administration The treatment period is 20 weeks. Oral investigational product, PF -04965842 or its matching placebo, will be administered for 20weeks . Subjects will be dispensed two (2) bottles of oral investigational product at the Day 1, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, and Week 16 visits. Subjects will be given clear dosing instructions to take one tablet from each bottle, once dail y, preferabl y in the morning whenever possible , at approximately the same time of day . On study visit day s, subjects (and caregivers, if applicable) are to be instructed to refrain from dosing at home, and are to administer investigational product in the clinic under observation . Subjects will sw allow the oral investigational product whole, and will not manipulate or chew the medication prior to swallowing. Oral investigational product may be taken with or without food, other than on study visit day s where fasting is required. Injectable investi gational product, dupilumab or its matching placebo, will be administered for 16weeks with the final injection planned for Week 14. Subjects will be dispensed prefilled syringes containing injectable investigational product at the Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8,"
63,page_63,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 64and Week 12 visits. I njectable investigational product will be administered at the site on Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8 and Week 12 under the observation of the unblinded administrator/trainer, and at home by the subject (or caregiver, if applica ble) at Week 6, Week 10, and Week 14. The unblinded administrator/trainer will instruct the subject (or caregiver, if applicable) on the proper aseptic technique to administer a subcutaneous injection when using the prefilled syringes. The first injectio n at the Day 1 visit will be administered b y an unblinded administrator/trainer and used to train the subject (or caregiver, if applicable) on correct injection technique. The second injection will be administered by the subject (or caregiver, if applicab le) immediately following the first injection, under the observation of the unblinded administrator/trainer. If an y issues with technique are observed, the unblinded observer must retrain the subject appropriatel y. All injections should be administered i n accordance with the dupilumab drug label. The investigator should assign the responsibility of unblinded administrator/trainer to a member of the stud y site staff who will not participate in an y other stud y-related activities, ensuring that all other site staff do not risk becoming functionally unblinded. Contact between the unblinded administrator/trainer and study subjects should be kept to a minimum. The unblinded administrator/trainer must not take any action that may potentially reveal treatment assignment to the subject or site staff. The investigator, site staff, and any study participants other than the unblinded administrator/trainer must not be allowed to know the investigational product assigned to an y stud y subject and must not be allowed to see the treatment records. At Week 16, subjects previously receiving only placebo will receive PF -04965842 100mgQD or 200 mg QD as per randomized allocation. Subjects previously receiving PF-04965842 100 mg QD or 200 mg QD will continue on this dose. Subjects previousl y receiving dupilumab will continue to take oral placebo. These alterations to study treatment will all be conducted while maintaining the blind, when re- issuing oral investigational product to all subjects at the Week 16 time point. A guidance document with detailed dosing instructions will also be provided to subjects to support at -home dosing. 5.6.Medical Devices 1.The devices manufactured for Pfizer by a third party provided for use in this study are: a.pre-filled s yringes for subcutaneous i njection of dupilumab (manufactured by Sanofi -Regen eron followed by relabeling and repackaging for Pfizer by a third party ); b.pre-filled s yringes for subcutaneous injection of matching placebo. 2. Instructions for medical device use are provided in the Dosin g Instructions."

Investigational product should be stored in their original container and in accordance with the labels. See the Investigational Product Manual (IP Manual) for storage conditions of the product. Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD will be superseded b y the storage conditions stated on the product label. Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures fo r all site storage locations (as applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room -temperature products). This should be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study . Even for continuous- monitoring sy stems, a log o r site procedure that ensures active evaluation for excursions should be available. The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum temperature is checked each business day to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last evaluation and to provid e the site with the capability to store or view the minimum/maximum temperature for all non- working day s upon return to normal operations. The operation of the temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, should be regularl y inspected to ensure they are maintained in working order. Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to Pfizer upon discovery . The site should actively pursue options for returning the product to the storag e conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible. Deviations from the storage requirements, including any actions taken, must be doc umented and reported to Pfizer. Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used until Pfizer provides documentation of permission to use the investigational product. It will not be considered a protocol deviation if Pfizer approves the use of the investigational product after the temperature excursion. Use of the inves tigational product prior to Pfizer approval will be considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the si te in the I P Manual. Receipt of materials, door opening and clo sing, and other routine handling operations where the products are briefl y out of the temperature range described in the labeling are not considered excursions. Site staff will instruct subjects on the proper storage requirements for take home investigatio nal products."
65,page_65,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 665.8.Investigational Product Accountability The investigator site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other disposition of the investigational product supplies. All investigational products will be accounted for using a drug accountabilit y form/record. To ensure adequate records, all drug supplies will be accounted for in the drug accountability inventory forms as instructed by Pfizer and will be monitored b y the accounting of unused investigational product retur ned b y the subjects. At the end of the clinical trial, all drug supplies unallocated or unused by the subjects must be returned to Pfizer or its appointed agent, or destro yed in an approved manner unless otherwise authorized by Pfizer. In either case, th e forms must identify the investigational product, including batch or code numbers, and account for its disposition on a subject -by-subject basis, including specific dates and quantities. All bottles of oral investigational product must be brought back to the site at every visit for inspection by the site staff and all bottles/unused oral investigational product must be returned to the investigator by the subject at the relevant visit(s). Subjects will be directed to bring an y used and unused sy ringe carton s to all visits for inspection by the site staff. Study sites will provide subjects with a sharps container for disposal of used sy ringes. Subjects will return this sharps container to the study site at the final visit for disposal. 5.8.1. Destruction of Invest igational Product Supplies The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused investigational product (eg, at the site). If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the investigator must ensure that the mat erials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy , and any special instructions provided by Pfizer, and all destruction must be adequatel y documented. 5.9. Concomitant Treatment(s) Subjects will abstain from all concomitant medications as described in Section 4.2and Appendix 3of the protocol. Medications that are taken in the Screening/Washout period (after informed consent is obtained and before the first dose of investigational product) will be documented as prior medications. Medications taken after the first dose of investigational product has been administered will be documented as concomitant medic ations. All concomitant medications taken during the study must be recorded in study records with indication (if atopic dermatitis), reference to an y associated adverse event, dose, and start and stop dates of administration. Subjects will be queried abo ut concomitant medication (including topical medications and treatments, over- the-counter and prescription medications and treatments, and vaccinations) at each study visit. Any new concomitant medications or dose changes to current concomitant medication s should be evaluated for potential new or worsening adverse events."

Permitted Concomitant Medications Background Topical Therapy Subjects must comply with standardized background topical therap y guidance throughout the study . Background topical therap y will not be provided by the sponsor. Standardized background topical therapy refers to the below, in accordance with the local standard of care and according to the Investigator’s usual practice: Non-medicated Topical Therapy Non- medicated topical emollie ntwithout other active ingredients indicated to treat AD, or other additives which could a ffect AD (eg, hyaluronic acid, urea, ceramide or filaggrin degradation products) : must be applied at least twice dail y to all body areas affected with AD, throughout at least the final 7 days prior to Day 1 and throughout the remainder of the study . Medicated Topical Therapy Topical Corticosteroids (TCS) must be applied once dail y to areas with active lesions, starting on Day 1 (Baseline) and throughout the study, acc ording to the guidance below: Medium potency TCS (eg, Triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream or fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% ointment) must be applied to body areas with active lesions that are suitable for the use of medium potency TCS. Subjects must be cli nically monitored for toxicity to topical steroids and stepped down as needed. After lesions are under control (clear or almost clear), treat once dail y for a further 7 days, then stop; If lesions return then resume treatment with medium potency TCS, but use the approach described above upon lesion resolution. Low potency TCS (ie, hydrocortisone 1% cream) must be applied to body areas of thin skin (face, neck, intertriginous, and genital areas, areas of skin atroph y, etc.) with active lesions instead of med ium potency TCS or to body areas where continued treatment with medium potency TCS is considered unsafe. Subjects must be clinically monitored for toxicity to topical steroids and stepped down as needed. After lesions are under control (clear or almost c lear), treat once dail y for a further 7 days, then stop; If lesions return then resume treatment with low potency TCS, but use the approach described above upon lesion resolution."

NOTE : Background topical therap y must not be applied prior to attending a study visit, on the day of the stud y visit. Background topical therapy instead should be applied after the visit, on study visit day s. Other Concomitant AD Therapies The following other concomitant AD therapies are permitted during the study and will not be provided b y the sponsor: Oral anti histamines. The following concomitant medications are permitted during the stud y: Corticosteroid inhalers and intranasal spray s are permissible for subjects receiving a stable dose; Ophthalmic corticosteroids are permissible for subjects receiving a stable dose; Low dose acet yl salicy lic acid (100mg QD) is permitted, for the purpose of cardiovascular proph ylaxis, at the discretion of the investigator; Acetaminophen/paracetamol may be used intermit tently ; Vitamin and mineral supplements of standard potency are allowed in amounts not known to be associated with adverse effects (such as hyper -vitaminosis). For the purposes of this protocol, dietary supplements are defined as vitamins, minerals, and purified food substances. Vitamins, minerals and purified fo od substances are allowed in amounts not known to be associated with adverse effects (such as h yper-vitaminosis). Unless a prohibited medication or treatment, subjects may be administered any other medications necessary for the treatment of concomitant medical disorders as deemed necessary by the treating phy sician. Following Day 1, addition of concomitant medications or an y change in the dosage should be limited to those considered medicall y essential. A subject who is receiving a permitted concomitant me dication for an y reason must be on a locally -approved medication and dose, and this must be documented in the CRF. Subjects are not allowed an y other investigational drugs or treatments during the study ."

Subjects should report any changes to permitted medications during the study to the investigator as soon as they occur. Medication changes must be documented in the subject’s record and CRF. 5.9.2. Prohibited Medications and Treatments Subjects are required to discontinue and avoid using certain medications and treatments (see Inclusion Criteria and Exclusion Criteria , and Appendix 3). Subjects shoul d be instructed at each visit to contact the study site investigator promptly if there are any intended changes or additions to concomitant medications. All medications and treatments that could affect atopic dermatitis must be discontinued except oral antihistamines . Medicated topical therapy for AD must be washed out one week prior to Day 1 (Baseline). Starting on Day 1, standardized background topical therap y will be used as per protocol guidance in Section 5.9.1. Due to the potential to affect atopic dermatitis with ultraviolet light exposure, subjects must also avoid prolonged exposure to the sun and not to use tanning booths, sun lamps or other ultraviolet light sources du ring the stud y. Subjects who received prior treatment with systemic JAK inhibitors are to be excluded from the study . Prior treatment with topical JAK inhibitors is not exclusionary . Herbal medications with unknown properties or known beneficial effects f or AD must be discontinued at least 4 weeks before the first d ose of investigational product. Restrictions on certain vaccinations are described in Section 4.2. The Pfizer study team is to be notified of any prohibited medications taken during the study . After consulting with the Medical Monitor, the investigator will make a judgement on the ongoing eligibility of an y subject with prohibited me dication use during the study . 6.STUD Y PROCEDURES Refer to the Schedule of Activities for a detailed list of study procedures, as they should be cond ucted at each respective visit. Due to possible need for PPD testing and chest radiograph, screening procedures may be performed over more than 1 visit in the 28 days prior to the Day 1 visit. Visit windows are based on Day 1 visit. To assure consistency and reduce variability , all study visits should occur in the morning whenever possible. On day s of study visits, subje cts will receive their dose at the clinic during the visit."

All abnormal laboratory events of clinical significance should be followed until the laboratory values have returned to normal or baseline levels or are deemed clinically stable. Follow -up for abnormal laboratory findings and adverse events by the investigator is required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. Refer to Appendix 4for Guidelines for Monitoring and Discontinuation. Withdrawal of consent : Subjects who request to discontinue receipt of study treatment will remain in the study . If this request occurs at a scheduled visit, an end of treatment visit should be performed and the subject should enter into the follow -up period, with an end of study visit scheduled for 4weeks after the end of treatment visit. If the request occurs outside of a scheduled visit (eg,via telephone contact) the subject should be scheduled to return to site for an end of treatment visit within one week, and the subject should enter into the follow -up period, with an end of study visit scheduled for 4 weeks after the end of treatment visit. The only exception to this is when a subject specifically withdraws consent for any further contact with him or her or persons previously authorized by the subject to provide this informa tion. Subjects should notify the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow -up, whenever possible. The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records b y the investigator, as to whether the w ithdrawal is only from further receipt of investigational product or also from study procedures and/or posttreatment study follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that vital status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being m easured, publicly available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriatel y directed in accordance with local law. Lost to follow- up: All reasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing status. This includes follow- up with persons authorized by the subject as noted above. Lost to follow -up is defined by the inabilit y to reach the subject after a minimum of 2 documented phone calls, faxes, or e -mails as well as lack of response b y the sub ject to 1 registered mail letter. All attempts should be documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is determined that the subject has died, the site will use locally permissible methods to obtain the date and cause of death. I f the investigator ’s use of a third- party representative to assist in the follow -up portion of the study has been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the investigator may use a sponsor- retained third -party representative to assist site staff with obtaining the subject’s contact information or other public vital status data necessary to"
84,page_84,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 85complete the follow -up portion of the study . The site staff and representative will consult publicly available sources, such as public health registries and databases, in order t o obtain updated contact information. I f, after all attempts, the subject remains lost to follow -up, then the last -known- alive date as determined by the investigator should be reported and documented in the subject’s medical records. Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety (see also the Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events section) or behavioral reasons, or the inability of the subject to comply with the protocol -required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given study site. Subjects that discontinue study treatment will remain in the study and must have their end of trea tment visit within 1 week after their last dose, and will then enter the 4 -week follow -up period. See Appendix 4for Guidelines for Monitoring and Discontinuation. If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the subject. All attempts to contact the subject and information received during contact attempts must be documented in the subject’s medical record. In an y circumstance, every effort should be made to docume nt subject outcome, if possible. The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the subject regarding an y unresolved AEs. If the subject withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. 7.ASSESSMENTS Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -required tests and procedures are completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time th ere may be circumstances outside of the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safet y and well -being of the subject. When a protocol -require d test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely manner. For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and shipment instructions and contact information will be provided to the investigator site prior to initiation of the study ."

Pregnancy Testing For female subjects of childbearing potential, a serum pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed at screening. A urine pregna ncy test with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL, will be performed at every site visit inc luding the End of Treatment (EOT) and follow-up visits to confirm the subject has not becom e pregnant during the study, and at the follow-up visit. A negative pregnancy test result is required before the subject may receive the investigational product. Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cycle is missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy is otherwi se suspected). Pregnancy tests may also be repeated if requested by institutional review boards (IRBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations. Urine pregnancy tests must be sensitive to at least 25 mIU/mL an d will be conducted with the test kit provided by the central laboratory in accordance with instructions provided in its package insert. Subjects who have missed a menstrual period or who show an indeterminate or positive result on the urine test may not further progress i n the study until pregnancy is ruled out using further diagnostic testing (eg, a negative quant itative serum pregnancy test conducted at a certified laboratory). In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy, the subject will be withdrawn from administration of investigational product but may remain in the study. CCI"

Unscheduled safet y assessments may be performed at an y time during the study to assess any perceived safet y concerns. Investigators and Pfizer Clini cians (or designees) will review individual subject data throughout the conduct of the study to ensure subjects’ well -being. 7.3.1. Vitals Signs Vital signs (sitting blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rates and temperature) will be measured (pre-dose, if app licable) after 5 minutes of rest as indicated in the Schedule of Activities. Body temperature will be collected using the t ympanic or oral methods and the same method should be used consistently throughout the study . Blood pressur e (BP) will be measured using a standard calibrated blood pressure measuring device. A BP device that uses multiple cuff sizes based on the arm circumference is the required t ype of device. The appropriate cuff size for the subject must be used to ensure accurate measurement. The arm circumference at the midpoint of the length of the upper arm should be measured to determine the appropriate cuff size in accordance with the specifications of the BP measuring device. The same properly sized and calibrated blood pressure cuff will be used to measure blood pressure each time. Subjects should be seated in a chair, back supported, and arms bared (free of restrictions such as rolled-up sleeves, etc.) and supported at heart level. Measurements should be taken on the same arm at each visit (preferabl y non -dominant). Subjects should refrain from smoking or ingesting caffeine during the 30 minutes preceding the measurements. Measurements should begin after at least 5 minutes of rest. Heart rate should be measur ed at approximately the same time as BP for a minimum of 30seconds. When the timing of BP and pulse (heart) rate measurements coincides with a blood collection or other study procedure, BP and pulse (heart) rate should be obtained first. 7.3.2. Medical History, Physical Examination, Height, and Weight Complete AD disease history includes collection of details of AD at Screening: AD diagnosis, the use of topical treatments, s ystemic treatments and other treatments for AD. Medical history in addition to AD histor y including disease duration will be collected at screening. Medical history also includes history of alcohol and tobacco use. Smoking status and average weekl y alcohol consumption (units/week) will be collected, where a unit contains 12 g of pure alcohol, an amount equivalent to that contained in 5 oz/150 mL (a glass) of wine, 12 oz/360 mL of beer, or 1.5 oz/45 mL of 90 proof of spirits. Height and weight will be measured without the subject wearing shoes. Height (inches or centimeters) and weight (lb or kg) will be measured and recorded in the source document at th e screening"

Complete phy sical examinations must be performed by the investigator, sub -investigator or a qualified health professional per local guidelines. Complete phy sical examinations consist of assessments of general appearance; skin; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat (HEENT); mouth, heart; lungs ; breast (optional); abdomen; external genitalia (optional); extremities; neurologic function; and ly mph nodes. Targeted ph ysical examinations must be performed by the investigator, sub -investigator or a qualified health professional per local guidelines a nd should include skin, heart, lungs, and abdomen and examination of body systems where there are s ymptom complaints by the subject. Complete and Targeted phy sical examinations are performed at various time points, seeSchedules of Activities. 7.3.3. Chest X -Ray Chest radiograph (posterior -anterior and lateral views) or other appropriate diagnostic image (ie, c omputed tomography [CT] or m agnetic resonance imaging [MRI ]) with no evidence of current, active TB or previous inactive TB, taken at screening or within 12 weeks prior to Study Day 1 and read by a qualified radiologist, are required. Documentation of the official reading must be located and available in the source documentation. 7.3.4. Tuberculosis Testing At the time of screening, all sub jects will undergo tuberculosis (TB) testing unless performed within 12 weeks of Day 1. QuantiFERON-TB Gold I n-Tube Test is the preferred testing method. If the test results are indeterminate, the test should be repeated. If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold I n-Tube test cannot be performed, or if the results of the repeat test are indeterminate, then subjects may be screened using the Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) Tuberculin Skin Test (Mantoux method) with approval of the Pfizer Medical Monitor. In addition to TB testing as specified in this clinical protocol, a chest X- ray will be performed to aid in TB status determination. QuantiFERON-TB Gold I n-Tube is an in vitro diagnostic test using a peptide cocktail simulating ESAT -6, CFP -10and TB 7.7 proteins t o stimulate cells in heparinized whole blood. Detection of interferon -gamma b y Enz yme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) is used to identify in vitro responses to these peptide antigens that are associated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Quant iFERON-TB Gold In -Tube is an indirect test for M.tuberculosis infection (including disease) and is intended for use in conjunction with risk assessment, radiography and other medical and diagnostic evaluations."

Following sample processing, the sample will be shipped to the sponsor’s designated reference laboratory for testing. The procedure for processing and preparing the sample for shipment is described fully in the laboratory manual, which will be provided to investigators. A negative PPD test can be substituted for the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In -Tube test only if the central laboratory is unable to perform the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test or cannot determine the results to be positive or negative and the Pfizer Medical Monitor approves it, on a case -by-case basis. Japan only : While QuantiFERON®is the preferred testing method, the T-SPOT®.TBtest is also acceptable as the screening TB test . Like QuantiFERON®, the T -SPOT®.TBtest is an in vitro diagnostic test for M.tuberculosis infection; however, it differs in that it uses a peptide cocktail of ESAT -6 and CFP -10 proteins to stimulate peripheral blood mononuclear cells. T-SPOT®.TBtesting w ill be performed at the site’s local laboratory . Borderline results from the T- SPOT®.TBtest should be considered exclusi onary . If the T- SPOT.TBtest results are indeterminate, the test should be repeated. If the result of the repeat test is indetermin ate, subjects may be screened using the Mantoux/PPD skin test with Pfizer Medical Monitor approval. Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) Test If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In- Tube test or the T -SPOT®.TBtest (Japan only ) cannot be performed, or if the results c annot be determined to be positive or negative, then subjects may be screened using the Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) Tuberculin Test (Mantoux method), with the approval of the Pfizer Medical Monitor. Subjects must have the PPD test administered and e valuated b y a health care professional 48to 72 hours later in order to be eligible for the study , unless performed and documented within the last 3 months. The test should be performed according to local standards with induration of <5 mm required for in clusion. 7.3.5. Electrocardiogram A single 12 -lead ECG will be performed at screening and all other on -site visits as specified in the Schedule of Activities. ECGs reading will be interpreted by a central reader. All scheduled ECGs should be performed after the subject has rested quietly for at least 10minutes in a supine position. A subject’s screening ECG must not demonstrate clinically significant abnormalities prior to randomization."

Special Safety Assessment In the event of a suspec ted opportunistic infection, effort should be made to identify the pathogen utilizing laboratory or other methods appropriate to the clinical situation. In case of a suspected viral skin infection (eg, herpes zoster and herpes simplex or eczema herpeticum ), a specimen for viral DNA may be analy zed locally for confirmation and results provided to the adjudication committee to support evaluation. For subjects with a past history of oral or genital HSV and a presentation consistent to prior infections, furth er laboratory anal ysis may be performed at the discretion of the investigator. 7.4.Skin Type Assessment As part of baseline characteristics, a skin ty pe assessment will be done at the Day 1 visit using the Fitzpatrick Skin Ty pe assessment (Refer to Appendix 5). This is used to classify a person’s skin ty pe by their response to sun exposure (ie, burning or tanning). 7.5.Assessment of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Subjects meeting exclusionary results as described in Section 4.2 on the C -SSRS or PHQ -8 should be excluded from participation; it is recommended the subject’s primary care physician (PCP) should be informed, and the subject referre d to a mental health professional, either b y the PCP or the investigator according to their usual practice. 7.5.1. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) The Columbia Suicide Severit y Rating Scale is a validated tool for investigative staff to use to eva luate suicidal ideation and behavior ( Appendix 15).18 At the screening visit, if there are “y es” answers on items 4 or 5 in the past y ear or on any question in the suicidal behavior section of the C -SSRS in the past 5 years, the subject will not be included in the study . Trained site staff is to administer the C-SSRS to all subjects at screening, score immediately and assess the subject’s eligibility based on the ans wers. 7.5.2. Patient Health Questionnaire - 8 items (PHQ -8) The Patient Health Questionnaire –8 items ( Appendix 16) is a patient -reported questionnaire consisting of 8 items to assess the subject’s depression level. At Screening Visit, if PHQ -8 total score  15, the subject will not be included in the study .19Site staff is to administer the PHQ -8 to all subjects at screening and score immediately . 7.6.

Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) The Investigator’s Global Assessment of atopic dermatitis is scored on a 5 -point scale (0 -4), reflecting a global consideration of the ery thema, indu ration and scaling. The clinical evaluator of atopic dermatitis will perform an assessment of the overall severity of atopic dermatitis and assign an IGA score and category as described in Table 2. The assessment will be a static evaluation without regard to the score at a previous visit. Table 2. Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) Score Score Category Description 0 Clear Atopic dermatitis is cleared, except for any residual discolora tion (post -inflammatory hyperpigmentation and/or hypopigmentation). 1 Almost ClearOverall, the atopic dermatitis is not entirely cleared and remaining lesions are light pink (not including post inflammatory hyperpigmentation) and/or; have barely palpable hard thickened skin and/or papules and/or; have barely perceptible lichenification; excoriation and oozing/crusting are absent. 2 Mild Overall, the atopic dermatitis consists of lesions that are light red; w ith slight, but definite hard thickened skin an d/or papules; with slight, but definite linear or picked scratch marks or penetrating surface injury; with slight, but definite thickened skin, fine skin markings, and lichenoid scale; oozing/crusting is absent. 3 Moderate Overall, the atopic dermatitis c onsists of lesions that are red; w ith easily palpable moderate hard thickened skin and/or papules; with moderate linear or picked scratch marks or penetrating surface injury; with moderate thickened skin, coarse skin markings, and coarse lichenoid scale; with slight oozing/crusting. 4 Severe Overall, the atopic dermatitis consists of lesions that are deep, dark red; w ith severe hard thickened skin and/or papules; with severe linear or picked scratch marks or penetrating surface injury; with severe thickene d skin with very coarse skin markings and lichenoid scale; with moderate to severe oozing/crusting. The IGA will exclude scalp, palms, and soles from the assessment/scoring. 7.8.3. SCORAD SCORAD is a validated scoring index for atopic dermatitis, which combin es extent (0 -100), severit y (0-18), and subjective sy mptoms (0 -20) based on pruritus and sleep loss, each scored using a visual analog scale (0 -10). Extent (A, maximum score of 100%) To determine extent of AD, rule of 9 is used to calculate bod y surface a rea affected by AD as a percentage of the whole body surface area. Body surface area as percentage of total body surface area for each body region is as follows: Head and neck 9%; Upper limbs 9% each; Lower limbs 18% each;"
96,page_96,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 97Anterior trunk 18%; Back 18% ; 1% for genitals. The score for each bod y region is added up to determine the BSA affected by AD (A), which has a possible maximum score of 100%. Severity (B, maximum score of 18) A representative area of AD is selected. In this area, the severit y of each of the following signs is assessed as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2) or severe (3). Erythema (reddening); Edema (swelling)/papulation; Oozing/crusting; Excoriation (scratch marks); Skin thickening (lichenification); Xerosis (dry ness) (this is ass essed in an area where there is no inflammation). The severit y scores are added together to give 'B' (maximum score of 18). Subjective Symptoms (C, maximum score of 20) Subjective sy mptoms, ie, itch and sleep loss, are each scored by the subject or caregiv er using a visual analog scale (VAS) where “0” is no itch (or no sleep loss) and “10” is the worst imaginable itch (or sleep loss). The value for each should reflect the average on a 10 point scale for the last 3 days/nights. These scores are added to gi ve 'C' (maximum score of20). SCORAD Total Score The SCORAD for an individual is calculated b y the formula: A/5 + 7B/2 + C (can range from 0 to 103). 7.8.4. Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) The EASI quantifies the severit y of a subject’s atopic dermatitis b ased on both severity of lesion clinical signs and the percent of BSA affected. EASI is a composite scoring b y the atopic dermatitis clinical evaluator of the degree of ery thema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification (each scored separat ely) for each of four body regions, with"

Lesion Severity by Clinical Signs: The basic characteristics of atopic dermatitis lesions -erythema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification- provide a means for assessing the severit y of lesions. Assessment of these four main clinical signs is performed separately for four body regions: head and neck, upper limbs, trunk (includi ng axillae and groin) and lower limbs (including buttocks). Average ery thema, induration/papulation, excoriation, and lichenification are scored for each body region according to a 4- point scale: 0 =absent; 1 =mild; 2 =moderate; 3 =severe. Morphologi c descriptors for each clinical sign severity score are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Clinical Sign Severity Scoring Criteria for the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) Score Description* Erythema (E) 0 Absent None; may have residual discoloration (post -inflammatory hyperpigmentation and/or hypopigmentation) 1 Mild Light pink to light red 2 Moderate Red 3 Severe Deep, dark red Induration/Papulation (I) 0 Absent None 1 Mild Barely palp able to slight, but definite hard thickened skin and/or papules 2 Moderate Easily palpable moderate hard thickened skin and/or papules 3 Severe Severe hard thickened skin and/or papules Excoriation (Ex) 0 Absent None 1 Mild Slight, but definite linear or picked scratch marks or penetrating surface injury 2 Moderate Moderate linear or picked scratch marks or penetrating surface injury 3 Severe Severe linear or picked scratch marks or penetrating surface injury Lichenification (L) 0 Absent None 1 Mild Barely perceptible to slight, but definite thickened skin, fine skin markings, and lichenoid scale 2 Moderate Moderate thickened skin, coarse skin markings, and coarse lichenoid scale 3 Severe Severe thickened skin with very coarse skin markings and l ichenoid scale The EASI will exclude scalp, palms, and soles from the assessment/scoring. Percent BSA with Atopic Dermatitis: The number of handprints of skin afflicted with atopic dermatitis in a body region can be used to determine the extent (%) to which a bod y region is involved with atopic dermatitis ( Table 4). When measuring, the handprint unit refers to the size of each individual subject’s hand with fingers in a closed position."

Subjects are given a handheld device to complete the Pruritus N RS, PSAAD according to the Schedule of Activities . Delegated site staff will review compliance at each visit and counsel as appropriate. If a subj ect has repeated non-compliance, the subject should be re-trained on the device. If a subject is unable to complete the PROs on the handheld device due to documented diff iculty using the technological devices or other limitation, the subject will be permitted to enter or remain in the study. In the event of electronic malfunction, a replaceme nt device will be shipped to the site. Examples of the validated paper versions of Patient Reported Ou tcomes instruments are included in the Appendices of this protocol. In instances wher e an electronic device is used to collect the PRO data, the electronic version may differ slig htly in format or wording compared with the paper version to facilitate electronic implem entation. 7.10.1. Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) Severity of Pruritus The severity of itch (pruritus) due to atopic dermatitis will b e assessed using the Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale, a validated horizontal NRS ( Appendix 6 ).20 Subjects will be asked to assess their worst itching due to atopic dermatitis over the past 24 hours on an NRS anchored by the terms “no itch” (0) and “worst itch imaginable” (10). Subjects will enter the Pruritus NRS assessment into an eDiary. Severity of pruritus s core as it is assessed at the screening visit and on the day of the baseline visit will be in cluded in the evaluation of Inclusion Criteria 3(See Section 4.1 ). CCI CCI"

Subjects will be asked to assess frequency of itching due t o atopic dermatitis over the past 24 hours on an NRS anchored by the term s “never/no itching” (0) and “always/constant itching” (10). Subjects will enter Pru ritus NRS assessment into an eDiary. Frequency of pruritus will not be included in the eval uation of Inclusion Criteria 3 (See Section 4.1 ). The Pruritus NRS should be completed as per Schedule of Activities . 7.10.3. Patient Global Assessment (PtGA) The PtGA asks the subject to evaluate the overall cutaneous dis ease at that point in time on a single-item, 5-point scale ( Appendix 8 ). The same category labels used in the Investigator’s Global Assessment will be used for the Patient Global Assessmen t, ie, “severe (4)”, “moderate (3)”, “mild (2)”, “almost clear (1)”, and “clear (0)”. T he PtGA should be completed as per Schedule of Activities . 7.10.4. EuroQol Quality of Life 5-Dimension 5-Level Scale (EQ-5D -5L) The EQ-5D is a validated, standardized, generic instrument that is the most widely used preference-based health-related quality of life questionnaire i n cost-effectiveness and health technologies assessment (HTA) ( Appendix 9 ).21-24 Recently, a version was developed called EQ-5D-5L with 5 response levels on each dimension compared to th e 3 response levels in the EQ-5D-3L.21,23,24-27CCI"

Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) The DLQI is a validated general dermatology questionnaire that consists of 10 items to assess subject-reported health-related quality of life (daily activiti es, personal relationships, symptoms and feelings, leisure, work and school, and treatment) (Appendix 10 ).33It has been extensively used in clinical trials for AD. The DLQI is a psychometrically valid and reliable instrument that has been translated into several langu ages, and the DLQI total scores have been shown to be responsive to change. The minimally impo rtant difference for the DLQI has been estimated as a 3 to 5 point change from baseline.34The DLQI should be completed as per Schedule of Activities . 7.10.6. Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) The POEM is a validated 7-item PRO measure used to assess the i mpact of AD recalled over the past week ( Appendix 11 ).

Requirements The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safet y events on the CRF and for reporting safety events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adve rse Event (SAE) Report Form to Pfizer Safety. These requirements are delineated for 3 type s of events: (1) SAEs; (2) non-serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the in vestigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational expos ure. Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE Report Form to Pfizer Safety Within 24 Hours of Awareness SAE All All Non-serious AE All None Exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposureAll (regardless of whether associated with an AE), except occupational exposureExposure during pregnancy, exposure via breastfeeding, occupational exposure (regardless of whether associated with an AE) All observed or volunteered events regardless of treatment grou p or suspected causal relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following paragraphs. Events listed in the table above that require reporting to Pfiz er Safety on the CT SAE Report Form within 24 hours of awareness of the event by the investigat orare to be reported regardless of whether the event is determined by the investigat or to be related to an investigational product under study . In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life-threatening, notification to Pfizer Safety must be made immediately, irrespe ctive of the extent of available event information. This timeframe also applies to additional n ew (follow-up) information on previously forwarded reports. In the rare situation that the i nvestigator does not become immediately aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigat or must report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of hi s/her first awareness of the event.CCI"
104,page_104,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 105For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate informa tion both to determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE (see the Serious Adverse Events section below). In addition, the investigator may be requested b y Pfizer Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion. This information is more detailed than that recorded on the CRF . In general, this will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assess ment of the case and independent determination of possible causalit y. An y information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided. I n the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety . An y pertinent additional information must be reported on the CT SAE Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory data) are to be sent to Pfizer Safet y ONLY upon request. As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y non -serious AE that is determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by the sponsor as an SAE. To assist in the determination of case seriousness, further information may be requested from the investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical study . 8.1.1. Additional Details on Recording Adverse Events on the CRF All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF. It should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the same as the AE page of the CRF. When the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. AEs should be recorded using concise medical terminology and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information. 8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported b y the stud y subject. In addition, each study subject will be questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a non -leading manner. 8.1.3. Withdrawal from the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Subject Withdrawal section) Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF. When a subject withdraws from the study because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on theCRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the Requirements section above."
105,page_105,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 1068.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information The time period for actively eliciting and collecting A Es and SAEs (“active collection period”) for each subject begins from the time the subject provides informed consent, which is obtained before the subject’s participation in the study (ie, before undergoing any study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including a minimum of 28 calendar days; except as indicated below after the last administration of the investigational product. For subjects who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure status is determined. 8.1.4.1. Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety All SAEs occurring in a subject during the active collection period are reported to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form. SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are r eported to Pfizer Safety if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational product must be reported to Pfizer Safety . Follow up by theinvestigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. 8.1.4.2. Recording Non -serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF During the active collection period, both non-serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the CRF. Follow -up by the investigator may be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concur s with that assessment. 8.1.5. Causality Assessment The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such an assessment in accordance wit h the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable. An investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts (evidence) o r arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided. If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined b y the sponsor. If the investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related” to investigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study records."
106,page_106,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 107In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements. 8.1.6. Sponsor’s Repor ting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations. 8.2.Definitions 8.2.1. Adverse Events An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: Abnormal test findings; Clinically significant signs and sy mptoms; Changes in ph ysical examination findings; Hypersensitivity ; Progression/worsening of underl ying disease; Drug abuse; Drug dependency . Additionally , AEs may include signs and s ymptoms resulting from: Drug overdose; Drug withdrawal; Drug misuse; Drug interactions; Extravasation; Exposure during pregnancy (EDP); Exposure via breastfeeding; Medication error;"
107,page_107,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 108Occupational exposure. 8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings Abnormal objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when an y of the following conditions are met: Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; and/or Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing (outside of an y protocol -specified dose adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or Test result is considered to be an AE b y the investigator or sponsor. Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require recording as an AE. 8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: Results in death; Is life-threatening (immediate risk of death); Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect. Or that is considered to be: An important medical event. Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediate ly life-threatening and/or result in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as se rious."
108,page_108,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 109Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.2.4. Hospitalization Hospit alization is defined as an y initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or equivalent healthcare facility , or any prolongation of an existing admission. Admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg , from the psy chiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; however, the event leading to the emergency room visit is assessed for medical importance. Hospitalization does not include the following: Rehabilitation facilities; Hospice facilities; Respite care (eg, caregiver relief); Skilled nursing facilities; Nursing homes; Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/sa me-day/ambulatory procedures). Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating clinical AE is not in itself an SAE. Examples include: Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the developme nt of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory abnormality ); Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep); Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination); Protocol-specified admission during a stud y (eg, for a procedure required by the stud y protocol); Optional admission not associated with a precipitating clinical AE (eg, for elective cosmetic surgery ); Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE;"
109,page_109,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 110Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures. These should be noted in the baseline documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the individual subject. Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not be reporte d as SAEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE. 8.3.Severity Assessment If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of consistency , these intensity grades are defined as follows: MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function. MODERATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function. SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual fun ction. Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not necessarily an SAE. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as se rious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed above. 8.4.Special Situations 8.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study. All SAEs will be reported to Pfizer Safety by the investigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y database. 8.4.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by elevations in transaminases) are termed “tolerators,” while th ose who show transient liver injury , but adapt are termed “adaptors.” In some subjects, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome. These subjects fail to adapt and therefore are ""susceptible"" to progressive and serious l iver injury , commonly referred to as drug -induced liver injury (DILI). Subjects who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more frequently to determine if they are an “adaptor” or are “susce ptible.” In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by several days or weeks. The increase in TBili ty picall y occurs while AST/A LT is/are still elevated above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample)."
110,page_110,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 111In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have decreased. This occurrence is still regarded as a p otential DILI. Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be considered important medical events, ev en before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the subject’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who present with the follow ing laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases to definitivel y determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values: Subjects with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR AL T values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value >2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2×ULN or not available; For subjects with baseline AST OR ALT OrTBili values above the ULN, the following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline: Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 × ULN; or >8 × ULN (whiche ver is smaller). Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN or if the value reaches >3 ×ULN (whichever is smaller). Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed individually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor. The subject should return to the investigator site and be evalu ated as soon as possible, preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history , and physical assessment. In addition to repeating measurements of AST and AL T and TBili, labor atory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or prot ein adduct levels. Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology . A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y itself or as a co -formulated product in prescription or over- the-counter medications),"
111,page_111,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 112recreational drug, supplement (herbal) us e and consumption, family history , sexual history , travel history , history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted. All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria of AST/AL T and TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no other reason for the liver function test (LFT) abnormalities has y et been found. Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations p erformed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities. A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology . 8.4.3. Exposure to the Investigat ional Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure Exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding and occupational exposure are reportable to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of investigator aware ness. 8.4.3.1. Exposure During Pregnancy For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy (EDP) occurs if: A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been exposed (eg, because of tre atment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational product . An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direc t contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products). A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product pr ior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy . If a subject or subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report th is information to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant wom an (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by inhalation or spillage) to Pfizer Safety using the EDP supplemental form. This must be done irrespective"
112,page_112,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 113of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awa reness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy ). Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer Safet y of the outcome as a follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safet y as SAEs follows: Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion; Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality , as SAEs. In addition, infant deat hs after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the investigational product ; Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the sponsor. Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify developmental delay s). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that the subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner. 8.4.3.2. Exposure During Breastfeeding Scenarios of exposure during breas tfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of an associated SAE, to Pfizer Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form. An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specifi cally approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breas tfeeding."
113,page_113,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 1148.4.3.3. Occupational Exposure An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person (whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the product, which may or may not lead to the occurr ence of an AE. An occupational exposure is reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrol led in the study , the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file. 8.4.4. Medication Errors Other exposures to the investigational product under study may occur in clinical trial settings, such as medication errors. Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE Report Form to Pfizer Safety Within 24 Hours of Awareness Medication errors All (regardless of whether associated with an AE)Only if associated with an SAE 8.4.4.1. Medication Errors Medication errors may result from the administration or consumption of the investigational product b y the wrong subject, or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength. Medication errors include : Medication errors involving sub ject exposure to the investigational product; Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or do not involve the participating subject; Refer to Section 5.3 for examples of medication errors related to compliance with investigational product. Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page. In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately . Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by an AE, as determined by the investigator, the medication error is recorded on the medication error pag e of the CRF and, if applicable, an y associated AE(s), serious and non -serious, are recorded on an AE page of the CRF."

Medical Device Incidents (Including Malfunctions) Medical devices are being provided for use in this study for the purposes of subcutaneous injection of dupilumab or injectable placebo. In order to fulfill regulatory reporting obligations worldwide, the investig ator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the definitions of incident or malfunction that occur during the study with such devices. The definition of a medical device incident can be found in Appendix 17. NOTE: Incidents fulfilling the definition of an AE/SAE will also follow the processes outlined in Section 8 of the protocol. 8.4.5.1. Time Period for Detecting Medical Device Incidents Medical devi ce incidents or malfunctions of the device that result in an incident will be detected, documented, and reported during all periods of the study in which the medical device is used. If the investigator learns of an y incident at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study , and such incident is considered reasonably related to a medical device provided for the stud y, the investigator will promptly notify the sponsor. The method of documenting medical device incidents is provided in Appendix 17. 8.4.5.2. Follow -up of Medical Device Incidents All medical device incidents involving an AE will be followed and reported in the same manner as other AEs (see Section 8). This applies to all participants, including those who discontinue study intervention. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow- up includes an y supplemental investigations as indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the incident . New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed form with all changes signed and dated by the investigator. 8.4.5.3. Prompt Reporting of Medical Device Incidents to Sponsor Medical device incidents will be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours after the investigator determines that the event meets the protocol definition of a medical device incident.

Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Medic al Device Incidents The investigator will promptly report all incidents occurring with any medical device provided for use in the study in order for the sponsor to fulfill the legal responsibility to notify appropriate regulatory authorities and other enti ties about certain safety information relating to medical devices being used in clinical studies. The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements (eg, the head of the medical institution), will comply with the applicable local regul atory requirements relating to the reporting of incidents to the I RB/EC. 9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS Detailed methodology for summary and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study is outlined here and further detailed in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be maintained by the sponsor. The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the co -primary endpoint definitions or their analyses will also be reflected in a prot ocol amendment. 9.1.Sample Size Determination A total sample of 700 subjects, with 200 subjects randomized to PF -04965842 200 mgQD, 200subjects randomized to PF -04965842 100 mg QD, 200 subjects randomized to dupilumab and 50 subjects each randomized to two sequences of matching placebo for 16weeks followed b y (a) PF -04965842 100 mg QD and by (b) PF -04965842 200 mgQD (4:4:4:1:1 randomization) is planned. The two placebo sequences will be combined for purposes of analy ses at all visits up to and including We ek16, which would essentially result in a 2:2:2:1 randomization ratio. This would provide at least 96% power to detect a difference of at least 20% in IGA response rate between either dose of PF -04965842 and placebo, assuming the placebo response rate is 12% at Week 12. This will also provide at least 99% power to detect a difference of at least 30% in EASI -75 response rate between either dose of PF- 04965842 and placebo, assuming the placebo response rate is 23% at Week 12. For a given dose (PF -04965842 200mg QD or 100 mg QD), both co -primary endpoints must achieve statistical significance to meet the primary objective. In addition, this sample size will also provide at least 92% power to detect a difference of at least 15% in the proportion of subjects with a  4points improvement in the severit y of pruritus NRS between PF -04965842 and dupilumab, assuming the dupilumab response rate is 18% at Week 2. The T ype-I error rate is set at 5% (two -sided). The family wise Ty pe-I error rate (for testing the co- primary and key secondary endpoints) will be strongl y controlled at 5% using a closed-testing method based on a sequential, iterative Bonferroni- type approach as outlined below."
116,page_116,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 117The study has been sized to help gain sufficient safety data to be able to effect ively evaluate the benefit -risk of PF -04965842 in conjunction with the other studies in the clinical development program, therefore the power for the co- primary endpoints is relatively high. This sample size will also help ensure adequate power is maintai ned for testing all the co-primary and key secondary endpoints for both doses of PF -04965842 via the multiple testing procedure. 9.2.Efficacy Analysis 9.2.1. Analysis Sets The primary anal ysis population for efficacy data will be the Full Anal ysis Set (FAS) defined as all randomized subjects receiving at least one dose of investigational product. The primary efficacy endpoint and the key secondary efficacy endpoints will also be anal yzed for the Per -Protocol Anal ysis Set (PPAS) defined as a subset of FAS who had no major protocol violations. Major protocol violations would consist of not meeting inclusion criteria or meeting exclusion cr iteria or not having taken the correct randomized treatment for at least 80% of the assigned amount or not having adhered to standardized background topical therap y guidelines or having taken a protocol- prohibited concomitant medication or any other major protocol violation as determined b y the clinical team or medical monitor prior to database lock. The subjects excluded from the PPAS will be determined and documented before the study is un -blinded. For all anal yses, baseline value will be based on observations collected pre -dose. It is expected that the FAS as defined he re will be identical to a true intent to t reat (ITT) analysis set (randomized and dispensed study medication) because the first dose is administered in -clinic. Nevertheless ,any differences from ITT in terms of the number of subjects will be noted and summarized. 9.2.2. Testing Procedure for Multiple Comparisons The famil ywise T ype-I error rate for testing the co -primary and key secondary endpoints will be strongl y controlled at 5% using a sequential, Bonferroni -based iterative multiple testing procedure. The procedure will first test the co -primary endpoints (I GA and EASI -75 at Week 12 for 200mgQD vs placebo) at the 5% level. If this hy pothesis is not rejected, then all subsequent hypotheses will not be considered statistically significant. If this hy pothesis is rejected, then testing for statistical significance will continue for the co- primary endpoints (IGA and EASI -75 at Week 12) for the 100 mg QD vs placebo comparison. If this hypothesis is not rejected, then all subsequent hy pothes es will not be considered statistically significant . If this hy pothesis is rejected, then testing may continue as follows: A series of h ypotheses related to the severit y of pruritus at Week 2 will be tested at the 2.5% level in the order specified in Sequ ence A. If all h ypotheses in Sequence A are rejected, then the unused alpha level of 2.5% will be passed on to the testing for the Week 16 endpoints in the order specified in Sequence B at a 5% significance level"
117,page_117,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 118(see figure be low). All subsequent h ypotheses from any point where a h ypothesis cannot be rejected will not be considered statistically significant . If any hypothesis in Sequence A cannot be rejected at the 2.5% level, then testing for statistical significance will st op along this sequence but will continue for the hypotheses related to the Week 16 endpoints in the order specified in Sequence B at the 2.5% level. If all hy potheses in Sequence B are rejected, then the unused alpha level of 2.5% will be passed back for testing the hy potheses in Sequence A at the 5%level. All subsequent hy potheses from an y point where a h ypothesis cannot be rejected will not be considered statisticall y significant . Figure 2.Schematic for Multiple Testing Proced ure The figure above illustrates the procedure sho wing the sequence of the tests. 9.2.3. Analysis of the Primary Endpoints The co -primary endpoints will be analy zed using the (Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel) test adjusted by baseline disease severity group (moderate andsevere) and for a given dose both must achieve statistical significance to meet the primary objective. The difference between each active group and the placebo group in the proportion of subjects achieving IGA response (similarly for EASI -75) along wi th its 95% confidence interval (using the normal approximation for the difference in binomial proportions) will be reported. If a subject withdraws from the study , then this subject will be counted as non -responder for endpoints after withdrawal."
118,page_118,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 119Additi onal secondary analy ses will utilize missing at random (MAR) and missing not at random (MNAR) approaches. Missing observations will be multiply imputed using a tipping point analy sis to estimate the treatment effect under the assumption that the missing d ata mechanism is MAR or more generall y, is MNAR. A longitudinal logit -normal mixed model will be fit using only the observed data. Under the MAR framework, imputations will be based on the posterior predictive probability of response obtained from the posterior distribution under the mixed model. Under an MNAR framework, imputations f or the active treatment groups will be based on a linear combination of the posterior predictive probability of respon se for the active group and the placebo group . For eac h such complete d dataset, the estimates of the proportions and Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) -weighted difference of proportions between each active dose group and placebo will be obtained and Rubin’s rule will be used to combine the multiple estimates and standard errors across the imputed datasets and provide p -value s. 9.2.4. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints The key secondary endpoints which are summarized as proportions such as EASI -75, and the proportion of subjects achieving a 4 -point improvement from baseline in the severit y of Pruritus NRS measure will be anal yzed using the same method as for the co- primary endpoints. This would also apply to an y other binary endpoint in the study , such as the response based on subjects reported with PtGA of AD of clear (0) or almost clear (1) and 2point improvement from baseline over 12 weeks . For continuous endpoints, and change from baseline in the pruritus severit y using the NRS measure at all scheduled time points, a mixed- effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) wil l be used. This model will include the factors (fixed effects) for treatment group, disease severit y group, visit, treatment -by-visit interaction, and relevant baseline value. Within the framework of MMRM, the treatment difference will be tested at the p re-specified primary time point, Week 12, as well as at the other time points by time point -specific contrasts from the MMRM model. 9.3.Safety Analysis The safet y data will be summarized in accordance with Pfizer Data Standards. All subjects who receive inve stigational product (safet y population) will be included in the safet y analyses. All safety data will be summarized descriptively through appropriate data tabulations, descriptive statistics, categorical summaries, and graphical presentations. Safety endpoints for the study include: Treatment -emergent AEs and SAEs; Withdrawals from active treatment due to AEs; Serious infections, defined as an y infection (viral, bacterial, and fungal) requiring hospitalization or parenteral antimicrobials;"
119,page_119,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 120Safety laborato ry tests (eg, hematology [including coagulation panel], chemistry and lipid profiles); Vital signs; ECG parameters if applicable. Change from baseline on laboratory data and vital signs will be additionally summarized. 9.4.External Data Monitoring Committee This study will use an external data monitoring committee (E- DMC ). The E -DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safet y of subjects in the study according to the charter. The recommendations made by the E -DMC to alter the conduct of the stud y will be forwarded to Pfizer for final decision. Pfizer will forward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of safet y data that are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate. Composition o f the E -DMC and processes under which the E -DMC operates will be documented in the E -DMC charter. 9.5.Safety Adjudication Committees To help assess the specific, complex safet y events related to malignancies, cardiovascular events, and opportunistic infection (including eczema herpeticum and other infections of special interest) in this study , Safet y Adjudication Committees, consisting of clinical experts in each of the relevant clinical areas, will be set up to harmonize and standardize assessments. In order to allow for an unbiased safety assessment, the members of these committees will be blinded to treatment assignment. Further information about the Safety Adjudication Committees can be found in their respective charters, including a specific description o f the scope of their responsibilities, a plan where communication timelines are defined, and the exact process and definitions used by each committee to adjudicate the safet y events that they will adjudicate. Other safety events for adjudication may be id entified and included in the remit of the Safet y Adjudication Committees as appropriate. 9.6.Week 16 Analysis and End of Study Analysis There will be a total of two planned analy ses conducted for the study . The Week 16 Anal ysis will be performed after the las t subject in the study has the opportunity to complete the Week 16 visit. The Week 16 Analy sis will constitute as the final anal ysis for the co- primary and key secondary endpoints, and the overall family -wise Ty pe1 error will be controlled as specified i n Section 9.2.2 . The conclusions with regards to the co -primary endpoints and the secondary endpoints will be based on this anal ysis, and hence the overall family -wise Ty pe 1 error for this study is maintained. The results from the Week 16 Anal ysis will not be used to make decisions for modifying the stud y design or for stopping the stud y. Access to the database containing individual treatment group assignments will be restricted to the sponsor study team at the time of Week 16 Anal ysis. Study sites, investigators and subjects will not be unblinded."
120,page_120,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 121The purpose of the Week 16 Analy sis is to accelerate final reporting timeline. The final clinical study report ( CSR) for the stud y will be based on the results from the Week 16 Analy sis. The End of Study Anal ysis will contain additional data after the final database release and the results will be reported in a supplemental CSR. 10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE Pfizer or its agent will condu ct periodic monitoring visits during stud y conduct to ensure that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed. The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate. The investigator and in stitution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. This verification may also occur after study completion. During stud y conduct and/or after study completion, the investigator site may be subject to review b y the IRB/EC, and/or to quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. The investi gator(s) will notify Pfizer or its agents immediately of any regulatory inspection notification in relation to the study . Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with Pfizer or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will a llow Pfizer or its agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve an y discrepancies that are identified between the stud y data and the subject's medical records. The investigato r will promptl y provide copies of the inspection findings to Pfizer or its agent. Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide Pfizer or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings. It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING 11.1. Case Repor t Forms/Electronic Data Record As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study . A CRF is required and should be com pleted for each included subject. The completed original CRFs are the sole propert y of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Pfizer. The investigator shall ensure that the CRFs/DCTs are securel y stored at the study site in encrypted electronic and/or paper form"
121,page_121,"PF-04965842 B7451029 Final Protocol Amendment 5, 29May 2019 Page 122and will be password protected or secured in a locked room to prevent access by unauthorized thir d parties. The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safet y, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/ original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required. The CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the data contained on the CRFs are true. A ny corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry . In most cases, the source documents are the hospital or the ph ysician subject chart. In these cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document. In these cases, a document should be available at the investigator site and at Pfizer that clearl y identifies those data that will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document. 11.2. Record Retention To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the investigator agrees to keep records, including the ident ity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent documents, copies of all CRFs, safet y reporting forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports). The records should be retained b y the investigator according to the ICH guidelines, according to local regulations, or as specified i n the clinical study agreement (CSA), whichever is longer. The investigator must ensure that the records continue to be stored securel y for so long as they are retained. If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectivel y notified. The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another investigator, another institution, or an independent third party arranged b y Pfizer. Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations. The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before dispos ing of an y records, even if retention requirements have been met."

Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent docu ments, and other relevant documents, eg,recruitment advertisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC. All correspondence with the IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file. Copies of I RB/EC approvals should be forwarded to Pfizer. The only circum stance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/EC approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects. In that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately after the implementation. 12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, legal and regulatory requirements, and the general principles set forth in the I nternational Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences 2002), ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and the Declaration of Helsinki. 12.3. Subject Information and Consent All parties will comply with all applicable laws, including laws regarding the implementation of organizational and technical measures to ensure protection of subject personal data. Such measures will include omitting subject names or other directl y identifiable data in an y reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where required b y applicable law. The personal data will be stored at the study site in encry pted electronic and/or paper form and will be password protected or secured in a locked room to ensure that only authorized study staff have access. The study site will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data can be recovered in the event of disaster. In the event of a potential personal data breach, the study site shall be responsible for determining whether a personal data breach has in fact occurred and, if so, providing breach notifications as required by law. To protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, when study data are compiled for transfer to Pfizer and other authorized parties, subject names will be removed and will be replaced b y a single, specific numerical code, based on a numbering s ystem defined by Pfizer. All other identifiable data transferred to Pfizer or other authorized parties will be identified by this single, subject- specific code. The investigator site will maintain a confidential list of subjects who participated in the study , linking each subject’s numerical code to his or her actual identity . In case of data transfer, Pf izer will maintain high standards of confidentiality and protection of subjects’ personal data consistent with the Clinical Study Agreement and applicable privacy laws."

The informed consent documents used during the informed consent process and any subject recruitment materials must be reviewed and approved by Pfize r, approved by the IRB/EC before use, and available for inspection. The investigator must ensure that each study subject is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the stud y, the sharing of data relating to the stud y and possible risks associate d with participation, including the risks associated with the processing of the subject’s personal data. The investigator further must ensure that each study subject is fully informed about his or her right to access and correct his or her personal data a nd to withdraw consent for the processing of his or her personal data. The investigator, or a person designated b y the investigator, will obtain written informed consent from each subject before any study -specific activity is performed. The investigator will retain the original of each subject's signed consent document. 12.4. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable regulatory authorit y in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of any new information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately. In addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safet y measures taken b y the investigator to protect the study subjects against an y immediate hazard, and of any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of. 13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL 13.1. End of Trial in All Participating Countries End of trial in all countries is defined as the last subject last visit (L SLV). 14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA Premature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, change in opinion of the IRB/EC, or investigational product safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In addition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of PF-04965842 at an y time. If a stud y is prematurel y terminated, Pfizer will promptly notify the investigator. After notification, the investigator must contact all participating subjects and the hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within 7 days. As directed by Pfizer, all study materials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the g reatest extent possible."

Note 2: All CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inducers require a period of washout of at least 5half-lives plus 14days prior to the first dose of investigational product . For example, the average half -life of Carbamazepine after repeat dosing is 15 hours. The washout period is calculated as the sum of 5 half-lives (approximately 3days) and an additional 14 days for a total of 17 days prior to the first dose of investigational product . Note 3: Half -life refe rs to the half -life of the parent drug and its metabolites, which are inhibitors or inducers. The longest half -life should be used to calculate the period necessary to washout a medication prior to the first dose of investigational product. For example, fluoxetine and its metabolite norfluoxetine are both inhibitors of CYP2C19. The terminal half-life of fluoxetine is up to 6 days. However, norfluoxetine has a longer half -life, up to 16days.Therefore, the washout period should be calculated based on t he 5 times the half-life of norfluoxetine, for a total of approximately 80days prior to the first dose of investigational product. This is not an all -inclusive list. Study personnel should stay current and consult with their pharmacy to exclude all conco mitant medications that are CYP2C9 or CYP2C19 inhibitors or inducers."

Temporary Interruption to Dosin g An investigator can temporaril y interrupt dosing for up to a maximum of 14 consecutive day s for a subject, f or safet y reasons or while monitoring abnormal laboratory tests if the investigator judges that this is necessary . In the case of investigational product being withheld, all investigational products that the subject is re ceiving should be withheld (ie, both oral and injected investigational product , as applicable). The investigator should use their judgement with regard to unscheduled visits/laboratory/clinical assessments required to monitor the subject during this timeframe. If within this timeframe th e investigator judges that it is safe to restart dosing, then the subject may restart investigational product. If the investigator judges that it is not safe to restart dosing within this timeframe then the subject must be permanentl y discontinued from tr eatment, have an End of Treatment visit and enter the 4 -week follow -up period. Doses not taken for the reasons mentioned above do not constitute protocol deviations or medication errors and should not be considered dosing errors, but should be noted in th e dosing log with the reason for reduced drug consumption clearl y described. Discontinuation Criteria Subjects must be permanently discontinued from treatment if they meet any of the following criteria at an y point in the study: Marked prolongation of the QTcF interval to >500 ms or >60 ms change from screening ECG. Serious infection (see definition for Serious Adverse Events in Section 8.2.3)."

Medical Device Incident Definition A medical device incident is any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a de vice as well as an y inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectl y, might lead to or might have led to the death of a participant/user/other person or to a serious deterioration in his/her state of health. Not all inci dents lead to death or serious deterioration in health. The nonoccurrence of such a result might have been due to other fortunate circumstances or to the intervention of healthcare personnel. It is sufficient that: An incident associated with a device ha ppened. AND The incident was such that, if it occurred again, might lead to death or a serious deterioration in health. A serious deterioration in state of health can include an y of the following: Life-threatening illness; Permanent impairment of body func tion or permanent damage to bod y structure; Condition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above; Fetal distress, fetal death, or an y congenital abnormality or birth defects."
