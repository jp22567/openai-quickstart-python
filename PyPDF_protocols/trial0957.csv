Methodology This is a Phase II, multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (DBPC) parallel-arm study designed to determine the efficacy, dose response, and safety of M2951 in subjects with SLE, and to consider a dose to take forward into Phase III dev elopment. The study is composed of a Screening Period of four weeks, a DBPC Treatment Period of 52 weeks, an open-label LTE Period of 104 weeks, and a Safety Follow-Up Period of four weeks. Planned number of subjects Approximately 468 enrolled subjects (approximately 117 enrolled subjects per treatment group). To ensure enrollment of an adequate number of subjects with HDA, recruitment of subjects without HDA may be capped, depending on enrollment rates observed during the study of subjects with and without HDA. Primary endpoints !The co-primary efficacy endpoints are SRI-4 response at Week 52 in all subjects and SRI-6 response at Week 52 in a HDA subgroup. !The primary safety endpoints are nature, severity, and incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs); vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs); absolute values of and change from Baseline in serum total immunoglobulin (Ig) levels (IgG, IgA, IgM), total B cell counts, and clinical laboratory parameters.

Subject eligibility must be reviewed on Day 1 prior to randomization, and the first dose of the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) (M2951 or placebo) will be given while the subject is still on site for Day 1. Subjects must then return to the study site for study visits as indicated in the SOA. Subjects will receive the last dose of IMP at Week 52, which is the End of Treatment (EOT) for the study, unless they enter the LTE Period. From Day 1 to the Week 4 Visit, corticosteroids may be increased, decreased, initiated (within the first two weeks of the treatment period), or remain unchanged. However, the corticosteroid dose must be ≤30 mg/day prednisone-equivalent by the end of Week 4. From Week 4 to the Week 8 Study Visit, OCS dose will be reduced to establish a Threshold Dose, the maximum dose allowed at any time in the study, other than for treatment of flares. Treatment decisions will be made by Investigator assessment for the purpose of subject management. Rescue therapy will be allowed for the treatment of flares. Any subjects permanently withdrawn from IMP will be expected to complete the EOT/Early Withdrawal study visit within five days of IMP withdrawal, followed by the Safety Follow-Up Visit four weeks post last dose. Optional Open-Label Long-Term Extension Period Subjects who completed the 52-week DBPC Treatment period will be offered participation in the 104-week open-label, LTE Pe riod of the study. The purpose of the LTE Period is to allow all the subjects with the opportunity to receive active treatment with M2951 and to collect long term safety and efficacy data. The Investigator should review the optional LTE Period with the subject prior to the DBPC Week 52 visit. Signed consent will be obtained prior to participation in the LTE Period. The DBPC Week 52/EOT Visit will be considered the LTE Day 1 Visit. The Safety Follow-Up Visit will be deferred until treatment is stopped in the LTE Period, due to either a subject’s premature withdrawal/ear ly termination from the LTE, ter mination of the study by the Sponsor, or completion of the LTE treatment period. In some cases, due to Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) approval, regulatory-specific, or other administrative delays, a subject may experience a treatment gap between the IMP last dose received in the DBPC Period (Week 52/EOT visit) and the start of the LTE IMP treatment. Upon Principal Investigator (PI) request, these subjects may still be able to enroll in the LTE with approval from Merck/EMD Serono, on a case-by-case basis. If the day of rollover to the LTE occurs after the DBPC Week 56/EOS visit, all assessments noted at the LTE Day 1 vi sit will need to be completed. For subjects that rollover after the Week 52/EOT visit but prior to their scheduled Week 56/EOS visit, concomitant medications and AEs will need to be reviewed and updated, a nd the PI will need to ensure that the subject remains eligible for the study. No other additional assessments other than dispensing of IMP will need to be completed. 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCI CCI"

For subjects who do not participate in the LTE Period, the Safety Follow-Up Visit is scheduled four weeks (+ 5 days) after the last administration of study treatment in the DBPC Period. For subjects who participate in the LTE Period, the Safety Follow-Up Visit is delayed until four weeks (+ 5 days) after the last administration of study treatment in the LTE Period. Subjects who are approved to rollover into LTE Period after they entered, or completed, the DBPC Safety Follow-Up Period, may have two Safety Follow-Up Visits. Additional details of the Safety Follow-Up/ End of Study Visit are provided in the SOA. Assessment of Endpoints During the study, efficacy endpoints will be ev aluated using several disease activity indices, such as the BILAG 2004, SLEDAI-2K, PGA, and CLASI-A. As part of the efficacy assessment, the effects of treatment on HRQoL will be examined using Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) measures including but not limited to: SF-36v2, EQ-5D-5L, LupusQoL, FACIT-Fatigue, and PGIC. Health Resource Utilization will also be collected as part of the efficacy assessment. Safety will be evaluated through the nature, incidence, severity and outcome of AEs, and assessment of physical examination findings, ECGs, hematology and chemical laboratory assessments, vital signs, and change from Baseline in serum total Ig levels (IgG, IgA, and IgM)and total B cell counts. Treatment decisions will be made by Investigator assessment for the purpose of subject management. Rescue therapy will be allowed for the treatment of flares. Diagnosis and key inclusion and exclusion criteria Eligible male and female subjects, aged 18 to 75 years (In Japan, if a subject is < 20 years of age, the written informed consent from the subject’s parent or guardian will be required in addition to the subject’s written consent); must have diagnosis of SLE with either the SLICC criteria for SLE, or at least four of the 11 ACR classification criteria for SLE, of at least six months duration prior to Screening; SLEDAI-2K total score ≥6 (including clinical SLEDAI ≥4) at Screening Visit; and have positive test results for anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody and/or anti-nuclear antibody (human epithelial cell-2 ANA ≥1:80) at the time of Screening. Subjects are not eligible for this study if they have active, clinically significant interstitial lung disease or pulmonary arterial hypertension; proteinuria (urine protein to creatinine ratio [UPCR] > 4 mg/mg); acutely worsened renal function; central nervous system SLE; or within two weeks prior to Screening or during Screening: use of OCS > 30 mg daily prednisone-equivalent; use of injectable corticosteroids, or change in dose of corticosteroids.

If the absolute improvement in Week 52 SRI-6response in HDA subjects is only 20%, the power is 76%. Approximately 108 subjects will be randomized per treatment group to protect against a loss of information due to drop-out (for reasons other than efficacy/safety) of 5% over 52 weeks. Given the randomization ratio 1:1:1:1, the total sample size is planned to be 432 subjects. The study includes a Japanese cohort: 32 evaluable Japanese subjects total, increased to approximately 36 randomized Japanese subjects total to protect against loss of information. If enrollment of Japanese subjects is slow, the entire Japanese cohort may not be part of the primary analysis. Therefore, the total enrollment will range from n = 432 to 468, where468 = 432 + 36 is the number enrolled if none of the 36 Japanese subjects enroll in time to be included in the primary analysis. The number of subjects enrolled per group will range from n = 108 to 117. Eligible subjects will be randomized to treatment with placebo or M2951 (doses 25 mg once daily, 75 mg once daily, or 50 mg twice daily), through a central randomization process by an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS), stratified according to race (Black versus non-Black), region (US and Western Europe, Japan, and the rest of the world [RoW]) and disease activity at Screening (SLEDAI-2K total score < 10 versus ≥10) prior to dosing on Day 1. Subjects with SLEDAI-2K total score ≥10 at Screening will be considered to have HDA. There will be at least two planned analyses in this study - the primary and final analyses. There may be up to four planned analyses, depending on whether the optional futility interim analysis (IA) is conducted, and whether the analysis for treatment effect consistency is coincident with the primary analysis, or is conducted after the primary analysis. If the futility IA is conducted, it will be based on Week 24 SRI-4 response among all subjects in the primary analysis cohort and Week 24 SRI-6 response among HDA subjects in the primary analysis cohort. The IA will be conducted when 100% of subjects in the primary analysis cohort reach Week 24 of treatment or prematurely discontinue from treatment.

The primary analysis cohort consists of the first 432 subjects randomized. However, if drop-out for reasons unrelated to efficacy or safety is higher than expected, effectively reducing the power of the study, the Integrated Analysis Plan (IAP) may prespecify that the primary analysis cohort will include all subjects randomized. The primary analysis will be based on Week 52 SRI-4 response among all subjects in the primary analysis cohort, and Week 52 SRI-6 response among HDA subjects in the primary analysis cohort. This analysis will be triggered when 100% of subjects in the primary analysis cohort. !Complete Week 52 of treatment and either enter LTE or complete Safety Follow-Up, or !Prematurely discontinue from treatment prior to Week 52 and complete Safety Follow-Up, or !Prematurely discontinue from study without Safety Follow-Up. The Japanese cohort may be fully, partially, or not included in this primary analysis, depending on the enrollment rate. The Family-Wise type 1 error rate (FWER) du e to the co-primary endpoints and multiple M2951 dose group comparisons versus placebo will be controlled at the two-sided α= 0.05 level via a tree gatekeeping procedure. The four hypotheses associated with the comparisons involving the co-primary endpoints and the two highest dose groups will form the first family of hypotheses in the tree. This family will be tested via the truncated Hochberg procedure, with truncation fraction pre-specified in the IAP. The multiple-testing procedure for the remainder of the tree, including the hypotheses associated with the comparisons involving the co-primary endpoints and the lowest dose group, and the key secondary endpoints and all dose groups, will be pre-specified in the IAP. A treatment effect consistency analysis may be scheduled if the Japanese cohort does not enroll in time to be included with the primary analysis cohort. If the Japanese cohort enrolls in time to be included, the evaluation of consistency with respect to ethnicity of Week 52 SRI-4 response can be performed at the time of the primary analysis. If the Japanese cohort enrolls slowly, then the primary analysis will occur without inclusion of the Japanese cohort, and a separate consistency analysis will be triggered when 100% of enrolled Japanese subjects: !Complete Week 52 of treatment and either enter LTE or complete Safety Follow-Up, or !Prematurely discontinue from treatment prior to Week 52 and complete Safety Follow-Up, or !Prematurely discontinue from study without Safety Follow-Up.

Analysis of Co-primary Efficacy Endpoints The primary analysis of SRI-4 response at Week 52 among all subjects in the primary analysis cohort, and SRI-6 response at Week 52 among HDA subjects in the primary analysis cohort, will be an estimate of OR, together with associat ed two-sided 95% CI and p-value (testing null hypothesis H0: OR = 1.0), comparing each M2951 dose group to placebo, based on a logistic model for the odds of a given SRI response in the appropriate population, with M2951 dose group or placebo group as a factor and adjustment for covariates based on randomization strata. The primary analysis of the co-primary efficacy endpoints will be based on the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) analysis set. Descriptive statistics for SRI-4 response, and for SRI-6 response in the HDA subgroup, will be provided for each treatment group by time point. Analysis of Key Secondary Endpoints Time to first severe (BILAG A) flare during the Treatment Period in all subjects will be compared between M2951 and placebo via a stratified log rank test. The adjusted hazard ratio comparing M2951 to placebo will be estimated (together with 95% CI) via a Cox regression model, with treatment group as a factor, and controlling for covariates defining randomization strata. A subject who discontinues treatment or completes treatment without experiencing severe flare will have his/her time to flare cen sored at the last time point at which flare could be assessed. Kaplan-Meier estimates of probability of surviving free of severe (BILAG A) flare as a function of time on treatment will be provided for each treatment group. The analysis of SRI-4 response at Week 52 among serologically active subjects will be an estimate of OR, together with associated 95% CI and p-value, comparing each M2951 dose group to placebo, based on a logistic model for the odds of SRI-4 response in the serologically active population, with M2951 dose group or placebo group as a factor and adjustment for covariates based on randomization strata. A test for trend in dose-response, using the same logistic model, will be reported as a supportive analysis.

In addition, other agents targeting B cells are in late stage development for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Furie 2014, Wallace 2014) . Although randomized controlled studies with rituximab in SLE and lupus nephritis have not demonstrated significant benefit over placebo (Borba 2014, Merrill 2010, Rovin 2012) , this may be related in part to study design, as significant changes in background therapy were allowed. These results contrast with numerous uncontrolled studies and observational studies that have suggested benefit; many in the rheumatology comm unity perceive rituximab to be effective for a number of manifestations of SLE, and this off-label use is recommended in SLE treatment guidelines as an alternative for the treatment of refractory lupus nephritis (Bertsias 2008, Hahn 2012, KDIGO 2012) .

The available nonclinical and clinical data to date clearly support the pathogenic contribution of B cells in SLE. Novel non-depleting B cell therapies may deliver a more favorable benefit-risk balance than current B cell directed therapeutic approaches. In addition to silencing B cells, M2951 prevents innate immune cell activation which contributes to its efficacy. This is underlined by in-house preclinical data demonstrating superior efficacy over B cell depletion in a mouse lupus model, as well as efficacy in a mouse arthritis model despite continued presence of collagen-specific autoantibodies.

In the first in human Study EMR200527-001, M2951 was well tolerated In the completed Phase Ib study in subjects with SLE (Study EMR200527-002) M2951 was well tolerated. There were no SAEs reported during the study and no new safety signals were identifie d. Evidence of clinical benefit was not expected in this 4-week safety study. Important potential risks to subjects are based on nonclinical safety data of M2951 and clinical data on adverse drug effects associated with compounds of a similar pharmacological class. They include infection, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, gastrointestinal intolerance, renal toxicity, hepatocellular injury, atrial fibrillati on, drug-drug interactions, and embryo-fetal toxicity. Asymptomatic elevations in amylase and/or lipase have been observed in completed clinical studies of M2951. The clinical significance and risk status of these observations are being assessed. The Sponsor is also assessing the clinical significance of convulsions observed in dogs at very high levels of exposure. Risk minimization measures inherent to early phase clinical trials are considered adequate for the proposed clinical trial in subjects with SLE. An IDMC will continually review available safety and tolerability data and will be mandated to make immediate decisions regarding the conduct of the trial; no additional risk minimization measures are proposed. During the LTE, an internal SMC may review safety data on a regular basis during the LTE in lieu of the IDMC. 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCICCI CCI CCI CCI"

Approximately 432 subjects are planned to be randomized in a ratio of 1:1:1:1 to receive one of three doses of M2951 (doses 25 mg once daily, 75 mg once daily, or 50 mg twice daily) or placebo, taken orally for 52 weeks. The study include s a Japanese cohort (approximately 36 Japanese subjects). If enrollment of Japanese subjects is slow, the entire Japanese cohort may not be part of the primary analysis. Therefore, the total enrollment will range from n = 432 to 468 (n = 108 to 117 subjects per group). All subjects that choose to enter the LTE Period will be switched to active treatment with M2951 or to th e eventual Phas e III dose when decided. This trial will be conducted at approximately 180 sites across 20 countries. The study is composed of a Screening Period of four weeks, a DBPC Treatment Period of 52 weeks, an open-label LTE Period of 104 weeks, and a Safety Follow-Up Period of four weeks. The study will be conducted on an outpatient basis. Subjects will attend clinic visits at regular intervals as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (SOA). Screening Period The first visit will be a Screening Visit and will include a review of the inclusion/exclusion criteria (see Section 5.3). Subjects should undergo the Day 1 Visit as soon as possible after eligibility for the study has been confirmed. During the Screening Period, there will be no change in oral corticosteroid (OCS) dose (see Section 6.4.2) . Subjects who do not meet all inclusion criteria or meet an exclusion criterion within the Screening Period and are considered screen failures may undergo rescreening once, after approval by the Medical Monitor (see Section 7.1.1) . DBPC Treatment Period Duration of the Treatment Period will be 52 weeks starting at randomization (Day 1). The Day 1 Visit will be considered the Baseline for disease activity (e.g., BILAG 2004, SLE Disease Activity Index-2000 [SLEDAI-2K], Physician’s Global Assessment [PGA], and CLASI). Subject eligibility must be reviewed on Day 1 prior to randomization, and the first dose of the IMP (M2951or placebo) will be given while the subject is still on site for Day 1. Subjects must then return to the study site for study visits as indicated in the SOA. Subjects will receive the last dose of IMP at Week 52, which is the EOT for the study, unless they enter the LTE Period. 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCICCI"

However, the daily corticosteroid dose must be ≤30 mg/day prednisone-equivalent by the end of Week 4. From Week 4 to the Week 8 Study Visit, OCS dose will be reduced to establish a Threshold Dose, the maximum dose allowed during the remainder of the study, other than for treatment of flares. Treatment decisions will be made by Investigator assessment for the purpose of subject management. Rescue therapy will be allowed for the treatment of flares (see Section 6.4.2.2) . Any subjects permanently withdrawn from IMP will be expected to complete the EOT/Early Withdrawal study visit within five days of IMP withdrawal, followed by the Safety Follow-Up Visit four weeks post last dose. Optional Open-Label Long-Term Extension Period Subjects who completed the 52-week DBPC Treatment period will be offered participation in the 104-week open-label, LTE Period of the study. Th e purpose of th e LTE Peri od is to allow all the subjects with the opportunity to receive active treatment with M2951 and to collect long term safety and efficacy data. The Investigator should review the optional LTE Period with the subject prior to the DBPC Week 52 visit. Signed consen t will be obtained prior to participation in the LTE Period. The DBPC Week 52/EOT Visit will be considered the LTE Day 1 Visit. The Safety Follow-Up Visit will be deferred until treatment is stopped in the LTE Period, due to either a subject’s premature withdrawal/early termination from the LTE, termination of the study by the Sponsor, or completion of the LTE treatment period. In some cases, due to Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) approval, regulatory-specific, or other administr ative delays, a subject may experience a treatment gap between the IMP last dose received in the DBPC Period (Week 52/EOT visit) and the start of the LTE IMP tr eatment. Upon Principal Investigator (PI) request, these sub jects may still be able to enroll in the LTE with approval from Merck/EMD Serono, on a case-by-case basis. If the day of rollover to the LTE occurs after the DBPC Week 56/EOS visit, all assessments noted at the LTE Day 1 visit will need to be completed. For sub jects that rollover after the Week 52/EOT visit but prior to their scheduled Week 56/EOS visit, concomitant medications and AEs will need to be reviewed and updated, and the PI will need to ensure that the subject remains eligible for the study. No other additional assessments other than dispensing of IMP will need to be completed. Safety Follow-Up Period The Safety Follow-Up/End of Study Visit is scheduled four weeks (+ 5 days) after the last administration of study treatment. For subjects who do not participate in the LTE Period, the Safety Follow-Up Visit is scheduled four weeks (+ 5 days) after the last administration of study treatment in the DBPC Period. For subjects who participate in the LTE Pe riod, the Safety Follow-Up Visit is delayed until four weeks (+ 5 days) after the last administration of study treatment in the LTE Period. Subjects who are approved to rollover in to LTE Peri od after they entered, or completed, the DBPC Safety Follow-Up Period, may have two Safety Follow-Up Visits. Additional details of the Safety Follow-Up/ End of Study Visit are provided in the SOA. 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCI"

As part of the efficacy assessment, the effects of treatment on HRQoLwill be examined using Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) measures including but not limited to:Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36v2®), EuroQoL 5 Dimension 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L), Lupus Quality of Life (LupusQoL), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT-Fatigue), and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)(see Section 7.3.5) . Health Resource Utilization will also be collected as part of the efficacy assessment. Safety will be evaluated through the nature, incidence, severity and outcome of AEs, and assessment of physical examination findings, ECGs, hematology and chemical laboratory assessments, vital signs, and absolute values of and change from Baseline in serum total immunoglobulin (Ig) levels (IgG, IgA, and IgM) and total B cell counts. Treatment decisions will be made by Investigator assessment for the purpose of subject management. Rescue therapy will be allowed for the treatment of flares. Statistical Methods There will be at least two planned analyses in th is study - the primary and final analyses. There may be up to four planned analyses, depending on whether the optional futility interim analysis (IA) is conducted, and whether the analysis for treatment effect consistency is coincident with the primary analysis, or is conducted after the primary analysis. If the futility IA is conducted, it will be base d on Week 24 SRI-4 response among all subjects in the primary analysis cohort and Week 24 SRI-6 response among HDA subjects in the primary analysis cohort. The IA will be conducted when 100% of subjects in the primary analysis cohort, reach Week 24 of treatment or prematurely discontinue from treatment prior to Week 24. If the response proportion difference for both co-primary endpoints is sufficiently low at Week 24, as defined in the Integrated Analysis Plan (IAP), consideration will be given to termination of the study. If enrollment is slower than expected, consideration will be given to conducting the interim futility analysis when the first 50% of the primary analysis cohort reach Week 24 of treatment, or prematurely discontinue from treatment. An IDMC will monitor safety and tolerability as well as review the data from the IA. The IA will be prepared by a team independent of the study teams (Sponsor and ). The primary analysis cohort consists of the first 432 subjects randomized.

Subjects will be on standard of care background therapy (e.g., antimalarials, immunosuppressants). The primary objective will focus on reduction in disease activity relative to placebo over 52 weeks in adult subjects with active, autoantibody-positive SLE who are receiving SoC therapy based on SRI-4 response at Week 52, or in reducing disease activity in a HDA subgroup (SLEDAI-2K total score ≥10) based on SRI-6 response at Week 52. The key secondary measures will evaluate reduction in flares relative to placebo and assess SRI-4 response in the serologically active subgroup, wh ere serologically active is defined as anti-dsDNA positive and/or low complement levels. Both SRI-4 response in the study population as a whole and SRI-6 response in a HDA subgroup will be evaluated to ensure that a robust signal on disease activity is demonstrated. Refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure for more detailed results from the completed clinical studies, including final data from clinical Study EMR200527-002. Based on the available nonclinical and clinical data to date, the conduct of the study specified in this protocol is considered justifiable (see Section 3). 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCICCI CCI"

54,page_54,"Evobrutinib (M2951) A Phase II Study of M2951 in SLE MS200527-0018 55/205 5.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints The primary and key secondary endpoints are standard for SLE studies and are accepted by regulators. The co-primary endpoints are SRI-4 response in the entire study population and SRI-6response in subjects with HDA, both at Week 52. These endpoints provide a measure of a subject’s response to disease treatment. The evaluation for greater improvement in subjects with HDA reflects the goal of specifically evaluating the ability of M2951 to provide relief in the subjects with more severe disease. The key secondary endpoint, time to first severe (BILAG A) flare during the Treatment Period, characterizes another aspect of response to treatment, specifically the ability of M2951 to improve control of flares. For the other key secondary endpoint, subjects who are serologically active (i.e., positive anti-dsDNA and/or low complement) will also be evaluated for response to treatment. As shown in other SLE studies, serologically active subjects demonstrated higher treatment effect size between the active and placebo groups in the SRI-4 response rates compared to the serologically inactive subjects (Stohl 2012) . The secondary HRQoL endpoints are complementary to the disease activity endpoints. The SF-36v2 has widely been used to assess phy sical, psychological and social impact of chronic diseases like SLE. The disease specific LupusQoL, and the symptom specific FACIT-Fatigue are well validated tools to measure disease specific aspects of HRQoL in SLE studies. The EQ-5D-5Lis the most accepted and often required instrumen t generating quality of life (QoL) outcomes data to be used by Health Technology Assessment bodies. 5.2.4 Inclusion of Special Populations Not applicable. 5.3 Selection of Trial Population Subject enrollment will be randomized and managed by an IWRS (see Section 6.3). Only subjects meeting all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria may be enrolled into the study as subjects(see Section 5.4). Prior to performing any study assessments not part of the subject’s routine medical care, the Investigator will ensure that the subject or the subject’s legal representative has provided written informed consent following the procedure described in Section 9.2. Eligibility will be evaluated and confirmed by the study eligibility team. Sites will be required to submit an eligibility packet (consisting of an eligibility checklist and appropriate documentation) for potential eligible subjects. The subjects’ eligibility will be assessed at a Screening Visit that 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCICCI CCI"

When a laboratory test must be repeated during the Screening Period or an unanticipated event occurs, the Screening Period can be extended to 8 weeks after discussion with the Medical Monitor. See Table 1 for a list of assessments done at Screening to determine the eligibility of the subject to participate in the study. Subjects cannot be randomized into the study until eligibility is confirmed. Screen failures may be rescreened once (see Section 7.1.1) . 5.3.1 Inclusion Criteria For inclusion in the study, all of the following inclusion criteria must be fulfilled: 1. Signed written informed consent before any study-related procedure is undertaken that is not part of the standard subject management and able to comply with requirements of protocol.

Subjects with SLEDAI-2K total score ≥10 at Screening will be considered to have HDA. For the purposes of this study, Black race will be defined as per the US Census definition. Specifically, Black race includes individuals who s elf-identify as Black, African American, Negro, and/or have origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa, including individuals of sub-Saharan African origin (e.g., Kenyan, Nigerian) and individuals of Afro-Caribbean origin (e.g., Haitian, Jamaican). Individuals of North African origin (e.g., Morocco, Egypt) are classified as non-Black, along with individuals from Sudan and Cape Verde due to their complex population history. Subjects declining to identify race will be placed in the non-Black stratum. The study is fully controlled by the IWRS, which assigns treatment individual (unique) kit numbers for each subject. The kit number is linked via the Good Manufacturing Practice qualified system to the corresponding treatment as well as to the subject.

Corticosteroid Dose Increases and Treatment of Flares: LTE Treatment Period During the LTE Period, CS doses up to 30 mg/d ay are permitted. In addition, a single dose of intramuscular steroid, no more than 80 mg of pre dnisolone equivalent, is permitted prior to the twelfth week of the LTE Period. CS medications are part of the subject’s previous SLE treatment and thus will not be provided by the Sponsor. If medications which are not permitted (as per Section 6.5.2) are required to treat the flare, and/or the flare has been ongoing between 2 visits at least 12 weeks apart without improvement, the subject must be discussed with the Medical Monitor to determine if the subject should be considered a treatment failure, and must be withdrawn from the study (see Section 5.5.1) . 6.5 Concomitant Medications and Therapies All concomitant medications taken by the subject during the study, from the date of signature of informed consent are to be recorded in the a ppropriate section of the eCRF, noting the name, dose, duration (i.e., start and end dates), dosing regimen (e.g., once daily, twice daily, etc.), and indication of each drug. Nondrug interventions and any changes to a concomitant medication or other intervention should also be recorded in the eCRF. 6.5.1 Permitted Medicines Any medications that are considered necessary to protect subject welfare and will not interfere with the study medication may be given at the Investigator’s discretion. Rescue medications may be administered to address ineffective treatment, anticipated adverse reactions or anticipated emergency situations. Additional treatments commonly given to subjects with SLE are permitted during the study as described in Section 6.5.1.4. 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCI"

All other dosing will be done by the subject or s ubject’s caregiver at home throughout the rest of the study. Compliance may be assessed via the patient diary for dosing and food intake around dosing. Subjects will be instructed to bring all IMP, including the used packaging, to each study visit to allow for the assessment of compliance with study treatment. Prior to discharge from each scheduled visit as determined by IWRS, subjects will be given sufficient IMP for at-home dosing until the next scheduled visit during the Treatment Period. Insufficient compliance with the protocol-specified dosing regimen is de fined as receiving < 80% of the required number of scheduled doses of study medication. If a subject has insufficient compliance, the Investigator or designee is to counsel the subject and ensure steps are taken to improve compliance. 6.10 Blinding Treatment with M2951 and placebo will be double-blinded. Subjects, Investigators, study staff and the study teams (Sponsor and ) will be blinded to treatment. All breaks of the study blind must be adequately documented. Packaging and labeling will be prepared to protect the blinded nature of the study. IMP (M2951 or placebo) will not be distinguishable from each other and will be covered by suitable labels to prevent subjects and study personnel from noticing any differences in the tablets of M2951 versusplacebo. Blinded treatment kit numbers will be obtained through the IWRS as described in Section 6.3. After Day 1, results of analyses that could reveal the PD effects of M2951 in an individual subject will be blinded to the study site, the Sponsor, and the CRO. These analyses will include: total Ig (IgA, IgM, and IgG), IgG subclasses, C3, C4, anti-dsDNA, ANA, other autoantibodies (anticardiolipin, anti-Smith antibody [anti-Sm]; an antibody to ribonucleoproteins; and antinuclear antibodies associated with autoimmune diseases including Sjögren syndrome and SLE [anti-Ro, anti-La]), and cell counts by flow cytometry (total B cells and B cell subsets). If the Investigator considers it necessary to have any of the above results for acute medical management of the subject after Day 1, then this should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. It should be noted that in the clinical utility of monitoring anti-dsDNA levels may be diminished due to an anticipated drop in levels as a consequence of M2951’s PD effects. Lymphocyte counts as assessed by routine complete blood counts will not be blinded, as these results are not anticipated to reveal PD effects, since B lymphocytes represent a small proportion of total lymphocytes (5% - 20%). An IA for futility may be triggered when 100% of the planned enrollment required for the primary analysis reaches 24 weeks of treatment, or discontinues treatment prematurely prior to Week 24. The IDMC will be fully unblinded to treatment and will make a recommendation, as described in the IDMC charter. A limited set of endpoints will be analyzed for the IA, including Week 24 SRI-4 response for the whole study population and Week 24 SRI-6 response for the HDA subgroup.

The unblinding procedures specified above will be followed, regardless of the timing of the interim futility analysis. Only when the trigger event for the primary analysis (Section 5.1) is reached, the protocol violations are determined, and the database is locked, will the drug codes be broken and made available for the primary analysis. If the Japan cohort enrollment is slow and cannot be fully included in the primary analysis cohort, a consistency analysis (occurring after the primary analysis) will be scheduled for the purpose of analyzing the entire Japan cohort. Only when the trigger event for the consistency analysis (Section 5.1) is reached, the protocol violations are determined, and the database is locked, will the drug codes be broken for the Japanese subjects not included in the primary analysis, and made available for the treatment effect consistency analysis with respect to non-Japan and Japan regions. 6.11 Emergency Unblinding The Investigator will have the ability to break the blind with regard to IMP for any subject at any time through the IWRS. However, the Investigator should make every effort to contact the responsible Medical Monitor or their designee to discuss the subject’s emergency situation and the need to unblind prior to unblinding any subject and must contact the Sponsor or designee within 1 working day after the event occurs without revealing to the Sponsor personnel the result of the code break. The Investigator will be able to access the subject’s treatment assignment 24 hours a day through the IWRS using a unique access code and user number (different from those used to assign subjects to treatment through the IWRS). Should the IWRS be unavailable for any reason, the Investigator will be able to break the blind via a telephone call to the IWRS help desk, which is available 24 hours a day. The help desk can access the database manually to perform the unblinding via telephone in the event that the IWRS is not operational. The Investigator must record the date of unblinding and the reason in the eCRF. Contact information for breaking the blind in an emergency is given on the subject emergency card provided to each subject (see Section 9.4). Under certain circumstances, the IDMC or Drug Sa fety may be required to unblind the treatment assignment for an individual subject following a SAE or other serious event; (e.g., if an expedited 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCIPPDCCI CCI CCICCI"

See Section 7.4.1.4 for further details on expedited reporting and SAEs. 6.11.1 Unblinding for Regulatory Authorities In cases where unblinding is required for the purposes of reporting expedited safety events to country-specific regulatory agencies or IECs, the unblinding will be performed by an authorized person(s). A blinded version of any documents to be submitted to the authorities will be shared as appropriate with study staff and site personnel. Only the authorized person(s) within the CRO and regulatory affairs will have access to the unblinded version of any documents. The procedures for requesting and obtaining unblinded information and for maintaining the integrity of the data and clinical study are outlined in the pharmacovigilance plan for this study. 6.12 Treatment of Overdose An overdose is defined as any dose greater than the highest total daily dose included in a CTP or planned for an individual subject enrolled in the study. . Any overdose must be recorded in the study medication section of the eCRF. For monitoring purposes, any case of overdose – whether or not associated with an AE (serious or nonserious) – must be reported to the Sponsor’s Global Drug Safety department or designee in an expedited manner using the appropriate reporting form (see Section 7.4). The effects of an overdose of M2951 are unknown, and there is no known specific treatment in case of overdose. In the event of overdose, subjects should be considered for hospitalization for observation if clinically indicated, and the Investigator or treating physician should use appropriate clinical judgment for the management of any clinical or investigational findings. 6.13 Medical Care of Subjects after End of Trial After a subject has completed the study or has withdrawn early, the subject is free to access further treatment as deemed appropriate by the Treating Investigator. The Sponsor will not provide any additional care to subjects after they leave the study because such care should not differ from whatis normally SoC for subjects with SLE. 7 Trial Procedures and Assessments Prior to performing any study assessments not part of the subject’s routine medical care, the Investigator will ensure that the subject has provided written informed consent according to the procedure described in Section 9.2. Upon subject’s agreement, the subject’s primary health care provider can be informed about subject’s enrollment in the study. 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCICCI"

HRQoL and subject self-assessment questionnaires must be completed first at visits where these assessments are collected. Unscheduled visits may occur at any time during the study in case of suspected flares or AEs (assessments to be performed according to the Investigator’s judgement). 7.1 Schedule of Assessments Prior to performing any trial assessments that are not part of routine medical care for the subject, the Investigator will obtain written informed consent as described in Section 9.2. 7.1.1 Screening Visit The subjects’ eligibility will be assessed at a Screening Visit that will occur up to four weeks prior to the Randomization Visit (Day 1). See Table 1 for a list of assessments done at Screening to determine the eligibility of the subject to participate in the study. Subjects should undergo the Day 1 Visit as soon as possible after eligibility for the study has been confirmed. Subjects who do not meet all inclusion criteria or meet an exclusion criteria within the first Screening Period and are considered screen failures may undergo rescreening once after approval by the Medical Monitor. The second Screening Peri od is a new 28-day Screening Period, and the subject will receive a new identification number. Testing at rescreening is required to be redone as noted below: Rescreening: Subjects who are considered screen failures after a first Screening Period may undergo rescreening once, after approval by the Medical Monitor. If a subject is rescreened, all Screening tests will need to be repeated except as follows: a. Documented CXR and TB testing if occurred within 3 months prior to the initial rescreening visit. b. Hepatitis and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) testing if occurred within 1 month prior to the initial rescreening visit. Retesting: During the initial Screening Period or single rescreening period, testing may be repeated once for subjects if test results would preclude enrollment in the study and are thought to represent a laboratory error, or a reversible, clinically insignificant intermittent condition, or are inconsistent with the subject’s historical values, after discussion with the Medical Monitor.

For the study entry, all of the subjects must fulfill all inclusion criteria described in Section 5.3.1, and none of the subjects should have any exclusion criterion from the list described in Section 5.3.2. 7.2.2 Diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Date of documented diagnosis of SLE, and presence/absence of the SLICC criteria for diagnosis of SLE (see Appendix II) and/or the presence/absence of the 11 ACR criteria for classification of SLE (see Appendix III) , serially or simultaneously, during any interval of observation, will be collected. Diagnosis of SLE will be defined as having presence of (serially or simultaneously, during any interval of observation): Presence of at least four criteria, including at least one clinical criterion and at least one immunological criterion; or biopsy proven lupus nephritis with positive ANA and/or positive anti-dsDNA; as specified in the SLICC Classification Criteria for SLE (see Appendix II) , Or,Presence of at least four of the 11 ACR classification criteria for SLE. The diagnosis must have been made and documented at least six months prior to Screening. If a potential subject has not been formally diagnosed with SLE, but has 6 months of documented and sufficient diagnostic criteria (ACR or SLICC, as above), they may be included in the study. The Investigator must review the medical history, confirm the retrospective diagnosis of SLE, and the Medical Monitor must provide documented approval. Additionally, subjects will be required to have SLEDAI-2K total score ≥6 (including clinical SLEDAI ≥4) at Screening. Subjects with SLEDAI-2K total score ≥10 at Screening will be considered to have HDA. 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCI"

Baseline measurements, such as vital signs, a complete physical examination, clinical laboratory parameters, 12-lead ECG, HRQoLassessments (SLEDAI Flare Index [SFI], SLEDAI-2K, PGA, C-SSRS, BILAG 2004, CLASI, SLICC/ACR damage index), and PD parameters will be assessed as indicated in the SOA(Table 1) . The HRQoL assessments on Day 1 are to be completed after inclusion/exclusion criteria are reviewed, verified, and the subject is randomized. 7.3 Efficacy Assessments Efficacy will be evaluated using the instruments and outcomes described below and at the visits specified in Table 1 andTable 2 in accordance with recommendations for outcome measures in SLE studies which suggest assessment of current disease activity, permanent damage, and HRQoL, ideally including an instrument sensitive to fatigue. All data collection and all query handling will be done via an eCRF system. An electronic device (electronic PRO [ePRO] system) may be used to collect some of the HRQoL assessments. 7.3.1 British Isles Lupus Assessment Group 2004 The BILAG 2004 Disease Activity Index evaluates SLE activity in a number of organ systems, based on the principle of “physician’s intention to treat” (refer to Manual of Procedures). The primary purpose of the BILAG in this study is to assess possible worsening in specific organ systems. Additional analyses of improvements in disease activity as assessed by the BILAG 2004 will also be done. A separate alphabetic score is assigned to each organ system, corresponding in general to the following definitions: !BILAG A: Severe disease activity requiring any of the following treatments (e.g., systemic high dose oral CS, intravenous pulse CS, systemic immunosuppressants, or therapeutic high dose anticoagulation in the presence of high dose CS or ≥20 mg prednisone). Note that in the context of a CTP with medication restrictions and blinded IMP, the term “requiring” is not taken literally, but indicates that if all else were equ al this would be the degree of treatment indicated. It is also understood that some subjects respond to different levels of medication than others, so that in assessing subjects with the BILAG “intent to treat” really means that most subjects with this degree of symptom would require this level of treatment, not necessarily the subject in question. !BILAG B: Moderate disease activity requiring treatment with systemic low dose oral glucocorticoids, intramuscular or intra-articular or soft tissue CS injection, topical CS or immunosuppressants, or symptomatic therapy such as antimalarials or NSAIDs. !BILAG C: Mild disease !BILAG D: System previously affected but now inactive !BILAG E: System never involved 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCI"
93,page_93,"Evobrutinib (M2951) A Phase II Study of M2951 in SLE MS200527-0018 94/205The BILAG 2004 is evaluated by scoring each of a list of signs and symptom as: improving (1); same (2); worse (3); new (4); not present (0); not done (ND). For some items, appropriate responses may be: Y/N or numerical values where indicated or Y/N confirm this is due to SLE activity. All signs and symptoms scored must be due to SLE. Use of a glossary provided with the BILAG 2004 instrument and training of assessors in use of the instrument are essential to obtaining reliable and consistent results. Use of the BILAG 2004 index for evaluating flares has been identified as a robust way of evaluating the efficacy of drugs; this judgment has been corroborated by external advisors and regulatory authorities. BILAG assessments should be conducted by a trained evaluator. Requirements for BILAG-based Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) response are: (1) BILAG 2004 improvement (all A scores at Baseline improved to B/C/D, and all B scores improved to C or D); (2) no worsening in disease activ ity (no new BILAG 2004 A scores and ≤1 new B score); (3) no worsening of total SLEDAI-2K score from Baseline; (4) no significant deterioration (< 10% worsening) in visual analogue PGA and (5) no treatment failure (defined as non-protocol treatment, i.e., new or increased immunosuppressives or antimalarials; or increased or parenteral corticosteroids; or premature discontinuation from study treatment) (Wallace 2014) . A copy of the BILAG 2004 and glossary is provided in the Manual of Procedures. 7.3.2 Physician Global Assessment The PGA is used to quantify disease activity and is measured using an anchored Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (see Figure 5) . The PGA will be determined on a continuous VAS that asks the Investigator to assess the subject’s current diseas e activity from a score of 0 (none) to 3 (severe), with the assessment made relative not to the subject’s most severe state but the most severe state of SLE per the Investigator’s assessment. As per its validation method, the PGA is recommended to be completed prior to laboratory results from the individual study visit being available (Petri 1992) . This version of the PGA is not scored blindly. The assessor is instructed to look at the previous month’s PGA, decide whether the overall condition of the subject is same, better or worse and move the line accordingly. A score change, where score is moved to the right from 2.5 or below in the previous month to > 2.5 this month, denotes an arbitrary threshold for severe flare to be considered when determining if enough change has occurred to justify assessing the criterion as severe flare. A score change≥1 unit to the right denotes a designation of mild/moderate flare. 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCI"

It is a modification for the SLEDAI to reflect persistent, active disease in those descriptors that had previously only considered new or recurrent occurrences. The SLEDAI-2K was validated against the original SLEDAI for evaluation over the previous 10 days. It has been shown to be reliable at different levels of disease activity (Gladman 1992, Gladman 1994) . The properties of the SLEDAI-2K are summarized in a recent publication of Romero-Diaz et al (Romero-Diaz 2011) . Subsequently, use of the SLEDAI-2K for evaluating the previous 30 days was validated, and evaluation of the previous 30 days is now the approach recommended for use in clinical studies (Touma 2010, Touma 2011) . The SLEDAI-2K uses a weighted checklist to assign a numerical score based on the presence or absence of 24 symptoms at the time of assessment or during the previous 30 days. Each symptom present is assigned between 1 and 8 points ba sed on its usual clinical importance, yielding a total score that ranges from 0 points (no symptoms) to 105 points (presence of all defined symptoms). However, if scored correctly, it is rare for even the sickest subjects to score more than 20 points. The assessor is also requested to assess the subject’s symptoms using the VAS for the PGA (see Section 7.3.2) . SLEDAI Flare Index The SFI can be used with any version of the SL EDAI, and will be used with the SLEDAI-2K for the purposes of this trial. A mild/moderate flare is defined as any of the following !Increase in SLEDAI instrument score of 3 points or more (but total score not to more than 12). !New or worse discoid, photosensitive, profundus, cutaneous vasculitis, bullous lupus; or nasopharyngeal ulcers; or pleuritic; or pericarditis; or arthritis; or fever due to SLE. !Increase in prednisone, but not to > 0.5 mg/kg/day. !Added NSAID or hydroxychloroquine (or chloroquine) for SLE activity.

The SLEDAI-2K and SFI assessments should be conducted by a trained evaluator.A copy of the SLEDAI-2K form is provided in a separate Manual of Procedures. 7.3.4 Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index is a validated measurement instrument for lupus erythematosus developed for use in clinical studies that consists of separate scores for the activity of the disease (CLASI-A) and the damage done by the disease (CLASI-D). The CLASI activity score is calculated on the basis of erythema, scale/hyperkeratosis, mucous membrane involvement, acute hair loss and non-scarring alopecia. The CLASI damage score is calculated on the basis of dyspigmentation and scarring, including scarring alopecia. Dyspigmentation due to lesions is defined as lesions that remain visible for more than 12 months, which are considered to then be permanent (Albrecht 2005) . The CLASI assessment should be conducted by a trained evaluator, and a copy of the Index is provided in a separate Manual of Procedures. 7.3.5 Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics / American College of Rheumatology Damage Index The SLICC/ACR Damage Index evaluates cumulative damage in SLE (Gladman 1996) .T h e s e changes may or may not be related to SLE. In order to ensure that features are not reversible components of active inflammation, most items are scored only if they have been present for at least six months. Scores range from 0 to 47 points, with higher scores indicating greater cumulative damage. However it would be exceedingly rare to see a damage index score of greater than 5 and most subjects in clinical studies have scores ranging from 0-2. 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCI"

As part of the study’s examination of efficacy, the effects of treatment on HRQoL will be assessed through changes in the SF-36v2, EQ-5D-5L, LupusQoL, PGIC, and FACIT-Fatigue scores (Hewlett 2005, McElhone 2007, Hurst 2004, Wolfe 1996, Yellen 1997) . Each HRQoL assessment will be used in the countries for which validated translations are available. A copy of each HRQoL assessment is provided in the Manual of Procedures. 7.3.6.1 Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey The SF-36v2 is a 36-item scale constructed to survey HRQoL on eight domains: limitations in physical activities due to health problems; limitations in social activities due to physical or emotional problems; limitations in usual role activities due to physical health problems; bodily pain; general mental health (psychological distress and well-being); limitations in usual role activities due to emotional problems; vitality (energy and fatigue); and general health perceptions (Ware 2008) . The SF-36v2 form asks for subjects to reply to questions (items) according to how they have felt over a specifically defined period of time. The items use Likert-type scales, some with 5 or 6 points and others with 2 or 3 points and yields scale scores for each of these eight health domains, and two summary measures of physical and mental health: the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and Mental Component Summary (MCS). The interval level scoring for all eight scales ranges from 0 (for worse health) to 100 (best possible health as measured by the questionnaire) with standardized summary scores for the PCS and MCS (mean = 50, SD = 10). Higher scores represent a better quality of life. Low scores on the PCS indicate significant limitations in performing physical activities, high degree of bodily pain and poor general health, while high scores reflect little or no such limitations. Low scores on the MCS indicate frequent psychological distress, social and role disability due to emotional problems and poor general health, while higher scores reflect little or no psychological distress or limitations. At each Assessment Visit, the SF-36v2 will be completed by the subject prior to the initiation of any other study activities or treatments. 7.3.6.2 Lupus Quality of Life The LupusQoL is a lupus-specific HRQoL questionnaire consisting of 34 items grouped in eight domains: physical health, pain, planning, intimate relationships, burden to others, emotional health, body image and fatigue (McElhone 2007) . Subjects indicate their responses on a five point Likert response format, where 4 = never, 3 = occasionally, 2 = a good bit of the time, 1 = most of the time, and 0 = all of the time. Summary scores can be calculated for all eight domains. The LupusQoL showed good internal reliability, test-retest reliability, and concurrent validity with the SF-36v2 and discriminant validity for different levels of disease activity and damage in SLE subjects (McElhone 2007, McElhone 2016) .

97,page_97,"Evobrutinib (M2951) A Phase II Study of M2951 in SLE MS200527-0018 98/2057.3.6.3 Patient Global Impression of Change The PGIC is a self-rated scale that asks the subject to describe the change in activity limitations, symptoms, emotions, and overall quality of life (Q oL) related to the subject’s painful condition on the following scale: 1 (very much improve d), 2 (much improved), 3 (minimally improved), 4 (no change), 5 (minimally worse), 6 (much worse) and 7 (very much worse). The subject will select the number that matches the subject’s degree of change since beginning the treatment with M2951(Hurst 2004) . The PGIC can be used as an anchor based method to assess clinically important change in which the judgment of meaningful change is made by the subject (Amirfeyz 2009) . 7.3.6.4 Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue The FACIT-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire that assesses self-reported fatigue and its impact upon daily activities and function (Wolfe 1996) . It uses a 5-point Likert-type scale (0 = not at all; 1 = a little bit; 2 = somewhat; 3 = quite a bit; 4 = very much). As each of the 13 items of the FACIT-Fatigue scale ranges from 0–4, the range of possi ble scores is 0-52, with 0 being the worst possible score and 52 the best. To obtain the 0-52 score, each negatively worded item response is recoded so that 0 is a bad response and 4 is good response. All responses are added with equal weight to obtain the total score. Fatigue is among the most prevalent symptoms of SLE, and can have profound effects on subjects’ HRQoL (Wolfe 1996, Yellen 1997) . The FACIT-Fatigue has been validated in subjects with SLE being a valid and responsive measure of fatigue in subjects with SLE (Hewlett 2005, Kosinski 2013, Lai 2011, Strand 2015) . 7.3.6.5 EuroQoL 5 Dimension 5 Levels The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is a generic measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value (Aggarwal 2009) . The EQ-5D-5L profile defines health in terms of mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. Each dimension has five levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems. The digits for fivedimensions can be combined in a five-digit number describing the respondent’s health state. EQ-5D-5L health states, defined by the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system, may be converted into a single index value. The index values, presented in country specific value sets, facilitate the calculation of quality-adjusted life years that are used to inform economic evaluations of health care interventions. The EuroQoL VAS records the respondent’s self-rated health on a 20 cm vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled ‘the best health you can imagine’ and ‘t he worst he alth you can imagine’. This information can be used as a quantitative measure of health as judged by the individual respondents. Higher scores on both EQ-5D-5L scales represent a better QoL.

Comprehensive assessment of any apparent toxicity experienced by each subject will be performed from the time of giving informed consent and throughout the study. The Investigator will report any AEs, whether observed by the Investigator or reported by the subject (see Section 7.4.1.2) . The Reporting Period for AEs is described in Section 7.4.1.3. 7.4.1 Adverse Events 7.4.1.1 Adverse Event Definitions Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratoryfinding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. For surgical or diagnostic procedures, the condition/illness leading to such a procedure is considered as the AE rather than the procedure itself. The Investigator is required to grade the severity or toxicity of each AE.Investigators will reference the National Cancer Institute - Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (NCI-CTCAE), version 4.03 CTCAE 2010, a descriptive terminology that can be used for AE reporting. A general grading (severity/intensity; hereafter referred to as severity) scale is provided at the beginning of the above referenced document, and specific event grades are also provided. Only if a particular AE’s severity is not specifically graded by the guidance document, the Investigator is to use the general NCI-CTCAE definitions of Grade 1 through Grade 5 following his or her best medical judgment. The five general grades are: !Grade 1 or Mild !Grade 2 or Moderate !Grade 3 or Severe !Grade 4 or Life-threatening 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCI"
99,page_99,"Evobrutinib (M2951) A Phase II Study of M2951 in SLE MS200527-0018 100/205!Grade 5 or Death. According to Sponsor convention, any clinical AE with severity of Grade 4 or 5 must also be reported as an SAE. However, a laboratory abnorma lity of Grade 4, such as anemia or neutropenia, is considered serious only if the condition meets one of the serious criteria described below. If death occurs, the primary cause of death or event leading to death should be recorded and reported as an SAE. “Fatal” will be recorded as the outcome of this specific event and death will not be recorded as a separate event. Only, if no cause of death can be reported (e.g., sudden death, unexplained death), the death per se might then be reported as an SAE. Investigators must also systematically assess the causal relationship of AEs to IMP(s)/study treatment (including any other non-IMPs, etc.) using the following definitions. Decisive factors for the assessment of causal relationship of an AE to the IMP include, but may not be limited to, temporal relationship between the AE and the IMP, known side effects of IMP, medical history, concomitant medication, course of the underlying disease, study procedures. Unrelated: Not reasonably related to the IMP/study treatment. AE could not medically (pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to the IMP/study treatment under study in this CTP. A reasonable alternative explanation must be available. Related: Reasonably related to the IMP/study treatment. AE could medically (pharmacologically/clinically) be attributed to the IMP/study treatment under study in this CTP. Abnormal Laboratory Findings and Other Abnormal Investigational Findings Abnormal laboratory findings and other abnormal investigational findings (e.g., on an ECG trace) should not be reported as AEs unless they are associated with clinical signs and symptoms, lead to treatment discontinuation or are considered otherwise medically important by the Investigator. If a laboratory abnormality fulfills these criteria, the identified medical condition (e.g., anemia, increased ALT) must be reported as the AE rather than the abnormal value itself. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: !Results in death. !Is life-threatening. (Note: The term “life-threatening” refers to an event in which the subject is at risk of death at the time of the event, not an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe) !Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongs an existing hospitalization, except in the case of hospitalizations due to protocol-defined SLE flares. !Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. !Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.

100,page_100,"Evobrutinib (M2951) A Phase II Study of M2951 in SLE MS200527-0018 101/205!Is otherwise considered to be medically important. (Note: Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered as SAEs when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.) For the purposes of reporting, any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via an IMP is also considered an SAE, as described in 7.4.1.4. Events that Do Not Meet the Definition of an SAE Elective hospitalizations to administer, or to simplify study treatment or study procedures (e.g., an overnight stay to facilitate intravenous therapy) are not considered SAEs. However, all events leading to unplanned hospitalizations or unplanned prolongation of an elective hospitalization (e.g., undesirable effects of any administered treatment) must be documented and reported as SAEs, except for unplanned hospitalizations due to flare of SLE. Events Not to Be Considered as AEs/SAEs Medical conditions present at the initial study visit that do not worsen in severity or frequency during the study are defined as Baseline Medical Conditions and are not to be considered AEs. Worsening of the underlying disease is not routinely to be considered an AE or SAE, but is rather an efficacy endpoint, unless deemed to be causally related to the IMP. However, if significant adverse signs or symptoms occur in association with complications or a prolonging of a hospitalization originally due to SLE flare, then these specific complications or hospital prolongation events should be recorded as AEs. Exacerbation of SLE SLE flares would not usually be reported as AEs unless they are unexpected in the context of the subject’s medical history. Further, the AE report should describe the event, rather than reporting an AE of “SLE flare” unless it is unavoidable. SAEs due to SLE flare are always reported, whether or not it is consistent with the subjects’ prior history. As for AE reports, the SAE report should describe the events, and avoid reporting an SAE of ""SLE flare"". 7.4.1.2 Methods of Recording and Assessing Adverse Events At each study visit, the subject will be asked about changes in his/her condition. During the Reporting Period of the study, any unfavorable cha nges in the subject’s condition will be recorded as AEs, whether reported by the subject or observed by the Investigator, unless it is a lupus flare that is not unexpected based on the subject’s medical history.

All SAEs must be additionally documented and reported using an SAE Report Form as described in Section 7.4.1.4. It is important that each AE report include a description of the event, its duration (onset and resolution dates [and times to be completed when relevant and possible to assess the time of AE onset relative to treatment administration]), its severity, its relationship with the study treatment, any other potential causal factors, any treatment given or other action taken (including dose modification or discontinuation of the IMP) and its outcome. In addition, SAEs should be identified and the appropriate seriousness criteria documented. Specific guidance can be found in the eCRF Completion and Monitoring Conventions provided by the Sponsor or designee. 7.4.1.3 Definition of the Adverse Event Reporting Period The AE Reporting Period for safety surveillance begins when the subject is screened (date of first signature of informed consent) and continues through the study’s Post Treatment Follow-Up Period, defined as the Safety Follow-Up Period (EOT through Follow-Up Week 4). SAEs occurring after a subject has taken the last dose of IMP will be collected throughout the subject’s participation until the end of the Safety Follow-Up Period, regardless of the Investigator’s opinion of causation. Thereafter, SAEs are not required to be reported unless the Investigator determines the SAE was related to IMP, or protocol procedure. Any SAE assessed as related to M2951 must be reported whenever it occurs, irrespective of the time elapsed since the last administration of M2951. 7.4.1.4 Procedure for Reporting Serious Adverse Events Serious Adverse Events In the event of any new SAE occurring during the Reporting Period, the Investigator must immediately (i.e., within a maximum of 24 HOURS after becoming aware of the event) inform the Sponsor or its designee by completing the SAE Report form in the eCRF following specific completion instructions. In exceptional circumstances, an SAE (or follow-up information) may be reported by telephone; in these cases, an SAE Report Form must be completed immediately thereafter. Relevant pages from the eCRF may be provide d in parallel (e.g., medical history, concomitant drugs). Additional documents may also be provided by the Investigator, if available (e.g.,laboratory results, hospital report, autopsy report). In all cases, the information provided in the SAE Report Form (clinical trial) must be consistent with the data on the event that are recorded in the corresponding sections of the eCRF.

This is necessary to permit a prompt assessment of the event by the Sponsor or designee and (as applicable) to allow the Sponsor to meet strict regulatory timelines associated with expedited safety reporting obligations. Requests for follow-up will usually be made via the responsible Monitor, although in exceptional circumstances the Global Drug Safety department may contact the Investigator directly to obtain further information or to discuss the event. 7.4.1.5 Safety Reporting to Health Authorities, Independent Ethics Committees/ Institutional Review Boards and Investigators The Sponsor or designee will send safety notifications to Health Authorities in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The Investigator must comply with any applicable site-specific requirements related to the reporting of SAEs (and in particular, deaths) involving study subjects to the IEC/IRB that approved the study. In accordance with ICH GCP, the Sponsor/designee will inform the Investigator of “findings that could adversely affect the safety of subjects, impact the conduct of the study or alter the IEC’s/IRB’s approval/favorable opinion to continue the study.” In particular and in line with respective regulations, the Sponsor/designee will inform the Investigator of AEs that are both serious and unexpected and are considered to be related to the administered product (SUSARs). The Investigator should place copies of safety reports in the Investigator Site File. National regulations with regard to safety report notifications to Investigators will be taken into account. For Japan only - In accordance with ICH GCP and the Japanese ministerial ordinance on GCP, the Sponsor/designee will inform the Investigator and th e head of the study site of “findings that could adversely affect the safety of subjects, impact the conduct of the study or alter the IEC’s/IRB’s approval/favorable opinion to continue the study.” In particular and in line with respective regulations, the Sponsor/designee will inform the Investigator and the head of the study sites of AEs that are both serious and unexpected and are considered to be related to the administered product (SUSARs). The Investigator should place copies of safety reports in the Investigator Site File. National regulations with regard to safety report notifications to Investigators will be taken into account. The head of the study site should also maintain copies of safety reports appropriately. When specifically required by regulations and guidelines, the Sponsor/designee will provide appropriate Safety Reports directly to the concerned lead IEC/IRB and will maintain records of these notifications.

Reasonable attempts to obtain this information must be made and documented. It is also the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that appropriate additional therapeutic measures and follow-up procedures are performed if possible. The Sponsor or designee will actively follow-up and collect information on any AE that occurs during the course of a clinical study; however while this activity will continue for any SAEs until stabilization or until the outcome is known, it will be discontinued at the time of database lock for nonserious AEs. 7.4.2 Pregnancy and In Utero Drug Exposure Only pregnancies considered by the Investigator to be related to study treatment (e.g., resulting from a drug interaction with a contraceptive medication) are considered to be AEs. However, all pregnancies with an estimated conception date during the period defined in Section 7.4.1.3 must be recorded by convention in the AE page/section of the eCRF. The same rule applies to pregnancies in female subjects and to pregnancies in female partners of male subjects. The Investigator must notify the Sponsor/designee in an expedited manner of any pregnancy using the Pregnancy Report Form, which must be transmitted according to the same process as described for SAE reporting in Section 7.4.1.4. If possible, Investigators must actively follow-up, document and report on the outcome of all these pregnancies, even if the subjects are withdrawn from the study (see Section 5.5.2) . The Pregnancy Report Form will be used to report outcomes and in case of adverse outcomes, the AE Safety Report Form (Clinical Trials) will be used for events occurring to the subject and the Parent Child/Fetus AE Report Form will be used if the child/fetus sustains an AE. Adverse outcomes must be reported in an expedited manner as described in Section 7.4.1.4, while nonadverse outcomes must be reported within 45 days from delivery. In the event of pregnancy in a subject occurring during the course of the study, the subject must be discontinued from studymedication immediately. The Sponsor must be notified without delay and the subject should be followed as described above. 7.4.3 Clinical Laboratory Assessments Blood and urine samples will be collected for the following clinical laboratory tests (Table 11) , following the timing noted in the SOA (Table 1 andTable 2) . All samples should be clearly identified. Sample collection, preparation, and handling/shipment procedures are described in the laboratory manual.

Height will be measured at Screening only. A semiautomated pulse rate and BP recording device with an appropriate cuff size will be utilized. Pulse rate and BP will be measured after 10 minutes rest in the semisupine position with the subject’s arm unconstrained by clothing or other material. The BP should be assessed on the same arm for each subject throughout the study. 7.4.4.2 Physical Examination Physical examinations will be assessed as indicated in Table 1 and Table 2. Physical examination includes assessment of the following: general appearance, skin, head and neck, mouth, lymph nodes, thyroid, abdomen, and nervous, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and respiratory systems. Physical examination findings during Screening before obtaining informed consent will be recorded as medical history even ts and new findings or worsening during the study as AEs. Abbreviated physical examination should always include assessment of head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, and extremities and other systems as required by symptoms. Additional assessments (e.g., creatine phosphokinase, ECG, chest radiograph) should be performed as needed to fully obtain information needed for the BILAG 2004 and/or SLEDAI-2Kassessments (see Sections 7.3.1 and 7.3.3) if scheduled, as well as to fully evaluate any subject complaints or AEs. 7.4.4.3 Resting 12-lead Electrocardiogram and Chest X-ray A 12-lead ECG will be performed as indicated in Table 1 and Table 2. The 12-lead ECG recordings will be obtained after 10 minutes of rest in a semisupine position. The following ECG parameters will be obtained directly from the computerized 12-lead ECG recordings: rhythm, ventricular rate, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval. The corrected QT interval will be calculated using Fridericia’s formula. The overall evaluation (normal/abnormal) will be recorded on the eCRF, and if abnormal, the specific abnormality will be recorded. Abnormal evaluations will be judged as clinically significant or not clinically significant by the Investigator. The printout of the ECG is to be signed, dated, and filed in the Investigator’s Site File along with a signed and dated copy (if the printouts are not on archive-quality paper). In addition, ECGs will also be stored digitally by the Sponsor. 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCI"

Subjects who had a CXR performed for clinical reasons within three months prior to the Screening Visit do not need to have the CXR repeated. The CXR should show no evidence of active infective process, or any other clinically significant abnormalities. The overall evaluation (normal/abnormal) will be recorded on the eCRF, and if abnormal, the specific abnormality will be recorded. Abnormal evaluations will be judged as clinically significant or not clinically significant by the Investigator. The 12-lead ECG and CXR will be performed and read locally. 7.4.4.4 Review of Concomitant Medications and Procedures Data concerning concomitant medications and proce dures will be collected throughout the study. These data will be obtained at scheduled and unscheduled study visits, based on information spontaneously provided by the subject and through questioning of the subject. Data concerning concomitant medications and procedures may also be obtained from the subject diary, but information thus collected must be reviewed and assessed medically before it is transcribed to the eCRF. 7.4.4.5 Unscheduled Visits Unscheduled visits may occur at any time during the study in case of suspected flares or AEs (assessments to be performed according to the Investigator’s judgment). 7.4.5 Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale The C-SSRS will be used for prospective suicidality assessment. The structured interview prompts recollection of suicidal ideation, including the intensity of the ideation, behavior and attempts with actual/potential lethality. The scale will be administered by the Treating Investigator or a qualified designee at Screening to identify eligible subjects. It will be self-administered at other time points during the study as per Table 1 andTable 2, using a validated, electronic, self-rated version of the C-SSRS (eC-SSRS) (Mundt 2010, Mundt 2013) . Subjects who answer “yes” to any suicidal behavior questions or to suicidal ideation questions 4 or 5 on the C-SSRS during the study should be referred for appropriate psychiatric care and the Medical Monitor notified. Please note that assessing the risk of suicide is a difficult and complex task when applied to the individual subject. No single clinical scale can replace a thorough medical examination and suicide risk assessment. Ultimately, the determination of the presence of suicidality depends on clinical judgment.

Prior to locking the database, a detailed IAP will be developed. Continuous variables will be summarized descriptively using the number of observations, mean, SD, median, first quartile (Q1), third quartile (Q3), minimum, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency counts and percentages. The denominator for the percentages will be the total number of subjects in the treatment group and analysis set being presented, unless otherwise specified (e.g., on some occasions, percentages may be calculated based on the total number of subjects with available data at a particular time point). Tests of treatment effect on each of the two co- primary efficacy endpoints will be conducted at a one-sided α-level of 0.0125, to maintain a study-wide one-sided α-level of 0.025. P-values and the two-sided CIs (97.5% or 95% as appropriate) will be presented where applicable. Actual p-values will be interpreted based on the multiple testing strategy, as specified in this protocol, and detailed further in the IAP. Treatment comparisons for each data type are described in later sections.Alternative or additional statistical methods may be used as appropriate as outlined in the IAP.

Analysis of individual site findings or country findings will be considered if necessary. For those measures that are analyzed using change from Baseline scores, observed scores may also be presented descriptively. For SRI-4 or SRI-6 response at Week 52 (Week 24), a subject experiencing flare or CS dose increase during Weeks 41 to 52 (Weeks 17 to 24), or a subject with a missing response at Week 52(Week 24), will be considered a non-responder. Four sensitivity analyses of the primary analysis are planned: (1) non-responder imputation for subjects discontinuing treatment for reasons due to efficacy/safety, with available observations used (in MMRM or multiple imputation) for subjects discontinuing treatment for reasons unrelated to efficacy/safety or completing treatment with missing response at Week 52, (2) unadjusted analysis, (3) completer analysis, and (4) per-protocolanalysis (i.e., excluding subjects with clinically important protocol violations). Additional procedures for handling missing, unused, or spurious data, and sensitivity analyses exploring the impact of missing data will be described in the IAP. The IAP will provide definitions of Baseline measurement as needed for change from Baseline endpoints. Treatment compliance will be assessed in terms of the percentage of the actual doses taken relative to the number of scheduled doses and summarized by descriptive statistics. All subjects will be included in individual subject data listings. Any changes in the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment only if the change affects a principal feature of the protocol. Any other changes to the planned data analysis that does not require a protocol amendment will be described in the IAP and the CSR. 8.5.2 Analysis of Primary Endpoints The primary analysis of SRI-4 response at Week 52 among all subjects in the primary analysis cohort, and SRI-6 response at Week 52 among HDA s ubjects in the primary analysis cohort, will be an estimate of OR, together with associated two-sided 95% CI and p-value (testing null hypothesis H0: OR = 1.0), comparing each M2951 dose group to placebo, based on a logistic model for the odds of a given SRI response in the appropriate population, with M2951 dose group or placebo group as a factor and adjustment for covariates based on randomization strata.Additional covariates may be included in the model as specified in the IAP. In the primary analysis of SRI-4 or SRI-6 response at Week 52, a subject experiencing flare or CS dose increase during Weeks 41 to 52, or a subject with a missing response at Week 52, will be considered a non-responder. The primary analysis of the co-primary efficacy e ndpoints will be based on the mITT analysis set, with supportive analyses based on the ITT and PP analysis sets, if the size of these analysis sets differ substantially (> 10%) from the size of the mITT analysis set. The Family-Wise type 1 error rate (FWER) due to the co-primary endpoints and multiple M2951 dose group comparisons versus placebo will be controlled at the two-sided α = 0.05 level via a tree 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCICCI"

The four hypotheses associated with the comparisons involving the co- primary endpoints and the two highest dose groups will form the first family of hypotheses in the tree. This family will be tested via the truncated Hochberg procedure, with truncation fraction pre-specified in the IAP. The multiple-testing procedure for the remainder of the tree, including the hypotheses associated with the comparisons involving the co-primary endpoints and the lowest dose group will be specified in the IAP. A test for monotonic dose-response relationship, between ordered M2951 dose and SRI-4 response OR relative to placebo, will be performed as a supportive analysis. Similarly, a test for monotonic dose-response relationship, between ordered M2951 dose and SRI-6 response OR relative to placebo, will be performed as a supportive analysis in the HDA subgroup. Descriptive statistics for SRI-4 response, and for SRI-6 response in the HDA subgroup, will be provided for each treatment group by time point. Safety endpoints are considered to be primary endpoints in this study. Analysis of safety data is described in Section 8.5.4. 8.5.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints The analysis of secondary endpoints will be based on the mITT analysis set. Descriptive statistics for secondary endpoints will be provided by treatment group and time point. The multiple-comparison procedure for testing the key secondary efficacy endpoints will be provided in the IAP. Other secondary e fficacy endpoints will be analyzed for . Key Secondary Endpoints Time to first severe (BILAG A) flare during the Treatment Period in all subjects will be compared between M2951 and placebo via a stratified log rank test. The adjusted hazard ratio comparing M2951 to placebo will be estimated (together with 95% CI) via a Cox regression model, with treatment group as a factor, and controlling for c ovariates defining randomization strata. A subject who discontinues treatment or completes treatment without experiencing flare will have his/her time to flare censored at the last time point at which flare could be assessed. A test for trend in dose-response, using the same Cox model, will be reported as a supportive analysis. Kaplan-Meier estimates of probability of surviving free of severe (BILAG A) flare as a function of time on treatment will be provided for each treatment group. The analysis of SRI-4 response at Week 52 among serologically active subjects will be an estimate of OR, together with associated 95% CI and p-value, comparing each M2951 dose group to placebo, based on a logistic model for the odds of SRI-4 response in the serologically activepopulation, with M2951 dose group or placebo group as a factor and adjustment for covariates based on randomization strata.

Other Secondary Endpoints In the analysis of other secondary efficacy endpoints described in Section 8.3.2, binary endpoints will be modeled via logistic regression, time to event endpoints will be modeled via Cox regressionand tested via stratified log rank test, continuous endpoints measured longitudinally will be analyzed using Mixed-effect Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM), and count endpoints (i.e.,annualized flare rate) will be modeled via negative binomial regression, with treatment group as a factor, and adjusting for covariates defining randomization strata. Analysis of annualized flare rate will use the log of observation time (in years) as an offs et in the model. Change in a binary endpoint between two time points will be analyzed via McNemar’s test. The effect of treatment on change in a binary endpoint will be analyzed via logistic regression, with treatment group, time point, and interaction as predictors, and adjusting for covariates defining randomization strata. All tests of efficacy will be conducted at a two-sided α level of 0.05, with p-values considered nominal unless generated as part of the tree gatekeeping multiple tes ting strategy as described in the IAP. P-values and the 95% CIs will be presented where applicable. Change in SF-36v2 PCS and MCS scores (and their components) over time, change in LupusQoL score over time, change in FACIT-Fatigue score over time, and change in EQ-5D-5L index over time, will be compared between M2951 treatment groups and placebo based on change from Baseline using MMRM, with treatment group as a factor, and adjustment for Baseline and covariates defining randomization strata. The PGIC score will be analyzed based on absolute score, using MMRM to account for subjects with missing data, with treatment group as a factor, and adjustment for covariates defining randomization strata. In the analysis of each secondary efficacy endpoint, other covariates may be included in the model, as appropriate. 8.5.4 Analysis of Safety Adverse events will be summarized by treatment group, severity, and relationship to IMP. Serious AEs, AEs leading to treatment discontinuation, and AEs leading to treatment withdrawal will be summarized by treatment group. Adverse events will be coded according to the medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA). The severity of AEs will be graded using the NCI-CTCAE v4.03 grading scale (Hahn 2012) . The number and percentage of subjects experiencing one or more treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) will be summarized according to the MedDRA system organ classes and preferred terms by treatment group, relationship to IMP, and severity.

Details will be provided in the IAP. Safety data collected during the LTE Period will be analyzed as described in Section 8.5.4. 8.6 Interim and Additional Planned Analyses Interim Analysis There may be an IA for futility based on the highest dose of M2951, triggered when 100% of subjects enrolled in the primary analysis cohort reach Week 24 of treatment, or prematurely discontinue from treatment prior to Week 24. If enrollment is sufficiently slow, consideration will be given to triggering the IA at an earlier time point, when the first 50% of subjects enrolled in the primary analysis cohort reach Week 24 of treatment, or prematurely discontinue from treatmentprior to Week 24. Pharmacokinetic analysis will not be included in the IA. The difference between Week 24 SRI-4 response proportion in all subjects in the primary analysis cohort, comparing the highest dose of M2951 to placebo, will be estimated, together with a two-sided 97.5% confidence interval. Similarly, the difference between Week 24 SRI-6 response proportion in HDA subjects in the primary analysis cohort, comparing the highest dose of M2951to placebo, will be estimated, together with a two-sided 97.5% confidence interval. If the response proportion difference for both co-primary endpoints is sufficiently low, as defined in the IAP, consideration will be given to termination of the study, in which case all subjects will be discontinued from IMP and scheduled for a four week Safety Follow-Up Visit/End of Study Visit.

This information is required during the study and for 12 months following completion of the study.This study is being conducted under a US In vestigational New Drug (IND), ther efore all investigational sites must complete an FDA Form 1572. 9.2 Subject Information and Informed Consent An unconditional prerequisite for a subject’s participation in the study is his/her written informed consent. The subject’s written informed consent to participate in the study must be given before any study-related activities are carried out. In Japan when a subject is < 20 years of age, the written informed consent must be obtained from the subject’s parent or guardian in addition to the subject’s voluntary written consent. The ICF must be approved by the IEC/IRB and regulatory authorities (in some countries) before it is provided to the subject. Adequate information must therefore be given to the subject by the Investigator before informed consent is obtained (a person designated by the Investigator may give the information, if permitted by local regulations). A subject information sheet in the local language and prepared in accordance with the Note for Guidance on GCP (ICH Topic E6, 1996) will be provided by the Sponsor for the purpose of obtaining informed consent. In Japan, a subject information sheet in the local language and prepared in accordance with Japan’s GCP and the Note for Guidance on GCP (ICH Topic E6, 1996) will be provided by the Sponsor for the purpose of obtaining informed consent. In addition to providing this written information to a potential subject, the Investigator or his/her designate will inform the subject verbally of all pertinent aspects of the study, including potential testing (see Section 9.3). The language used in doing so must be chosen so that the information can be fully and readily understood by lay persons. Depending on national regulations, a person other than the Investigator may inform the subject and sign the ICF, as above. Where the information is provided by the Investigator, the ICF must be signed and personally dated by the subject and the Investigator. In Japan, where the information is provided by the Investigator, the ICF must be signed and personally dated by the subject and/or the subject’s legal representative as applicable, and the Investigator. The signed and dated declaration of informed consent will remain at the Investigator’s site, and must be safely archived by the Investigator s o that the forms can be retrieved at any time for monitoring, auditing and inspection purposes. A copy of the signed and dated information sheet and ICF should be provided to the subject prior to participation. Whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to informed consent, the Investigator will revise the subject information sheet and any other written information to beprovided to the subjects and submit them to the IEC/IRB for review and favorable opinion. Using the approved revised subject information sheet and other written information, The Investigator will explain the changes to the previous version to each study subject and obtain new written consent for continued participation in the study. In Japan, the Investigator will explain the changes to the 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCICCI"

The subject will be given sufficient time to read the information and the opportunity to ask questions and to request additional information and clarification about the changes. 9.3 Subject Identification and Privacy A unique subject number will be assigned to each subject at inclusion, immediately after informed consent has been obtained. This number will serve as the subject’s identifier in the study as well as in the clinical trial database. The subject’s data collected in the study will be stored under this number. Only the Investigator will be able to link the subject’s study data to the subject via an identification list kept at the site. The subject’s original medical data that are reviewed at the site during source data verification by the monitor, audits and Health Authority inspections will be kept strictly confidential. Data protection and privacy regulations will be observed in capturing, forwarding, processing, and storing subject data. Subjects will be informed accordingly, and will be requested to give their consent on data handling procedures in accordance with national regulations. Confidentiality of information relating to the sample testing will be protected to the extent permitted by law. To protect against the risk of loss of confidentiality, all DNA samples will be marked with a code number only and will not be identified by subject name. Upon receipt at the analytical laboratory, the samples are recoded with a specific code that is different from the subject code number. The data generated with these samples will also be tracked with the . Only authorized personnel will have access to this code and to the key linking both codes. The key will be maintained in a restricted location. The results obtained from the samples in this study are for research purposes only. The results of the tests conducted with the samples will not be made available to the subject, members of their family, their personal physician, or other third parties, except as specified as follows. Unless required by law or regulatory authorities for the purpose of verifying information obtained from this study, only the Sponsor’s authorized personnel and agents will have access to the confidential genetic data. The results and other information from the tests study may be submitted to the regulatory authorities and governmental agencies in countries where the IMP may be considered for approval; however, the subject will be identified by subject and study number only. The subject will not be identified in any reports or publications resulting from this study. By default, results from genotyping will only be accessible to the Sponsor’s authorized personnel and agents and be handled without disclosure of subject identification. However, upon written request by the subject, the results from genotyping will be made available to the subject, if permitted by local law and regulations. If required by law or regulatory authorities for the purpose of verifying information obtained from this study, only the Sponsor’s authorized personnel and 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCICCI CCI CCI CCI CCICCI CCI"

The Emergency Medical Support card is based on the need to provide clinical study subjects with a way of identifying themselves as participating in a clinical study, and subsequently to give health care providers access to the information about this participation that may be needed to determine the course of the subject’s medical treatment. This service is designed to provide information to health care providers who are not part of the clinical study; and this may include the possibility of emergency unblinding if needed, in case of blinded studies. Clinical study Investigators, who are already aware of the CTP and treatment, have other means of accessing the necessary medical information for the management of emergencies occurring in their subjects. The first point of contact for all emergencies will be the clinical study Investigator caring for the affected subject. The Investigator agrees to provide his or her emergency contact information on the card for this purpose. If the Investigator is available when an event occurs, she or he will answer any questions. Any subsequent action (e.g., unblinding) will follow the standard processes established for the Investigators. In cases where the Investigator is not available, Merck Serono/EMD Serono provides the appropriate means to contact a CRO/Sponsor physician. This includes the provision of a 24 hour contact number at a call center, whereby the h ealth care providers will be given access to the appropriate CRO/Sponsor physician. The CRO/Sponsor physician will assist the health care provider in medical emergencies by providing information relating to the study and IMP. The CRO/Sponsor physician is not responsible or required for potential emergency unblinding, but should be notified as per Section 6.11 if emergency unblinding is to or has occurred, and may provide information if requested regarding the study and IMP. 9.5 Clinical Trial Insurance and Compensation to Subjects Insurance coverage will be provided for each country participating to the study. Insurance conditions shall meet good local standards, as applicable. In Japan, the Sponsor is entirely responsible for AEs that are associated with this study and impair the health of the subjects, except for AEs caused by an intentional and/or significant deviation on the part of the Investigator, the study site, and/ or the subject. The Sponsor will provide insurance to fulfill this responsibility. 'RFXPHQW1R  2EMHFW1R CCICCI"

They include infection, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, gastrointestinal intolerance, renal toxicity, hepatocellular injury, atrial fibrillation, drug-drug interactions, and embryo-fetal toxicity. These risks will be mitigated through the use of risk minimization measures inherent to early phase clinical trials and are considered adequate for the proposed clinical trial in subjects with SLE. An IDMC will continually review available safety and tolerability data and will be mandated to make immediate decisions regarding the conduct of the trial; no additional risk minimization measures are proposed.Given the predicted therapeutic benefit in the majority of the subjects at each dose, the tolerability and safety profile demonstrated, and the risk minimization measures in place Important potential risks to subjects are based on nonclinical safety data of M2951 and clinical data on adverse drug effects associated with compounds of a similar pharmacological class.

P values and the 95% CIs will be presented where applicable.In the analysis of other secondary efficacy endpoints described in Section 8.3.2, binary endpoints will be modeled via logistic regression, time to event endpoints will be modeled via Cox regression and tested via stratified log rank test, continuous endpoints measured longitudinally will be analyzed using Mixed effect Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM), and count endpoints (i.e., annualized flare rate) will be modeled via negative binomial regression, with treatment group as a factor, and adjusting for covariates defining randomization strata. Analysis of annualized flare rate will use the log of observation time (in years) as an offset in the model. Change in a binary endpoint between two time points will be analyzed via McNemar’s test.
