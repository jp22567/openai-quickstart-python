Patients are stratified into two groups: (1) children with SCD with strokes; and (2) adults with severe SCD. Based on their age and entry criteria, participants are enrolled in 2 strata as defined below. The primary endpoint of event-free surviv al (EFS) will be estimated in each age-specific stratum. Primary Objective: The primary objective is to estimate EFS at 2 years after haploidentical BMT in patients w ith SCD enrolled in 2 strata – children 5.00 – 14.99 years of age at enrollment with SCD and adults 15.00 - 45.99 years of age at enrollment with severe SCD. Primary or secondary graft rejection, second tr ansplant, or death will count as events for this endpoint. Stratum- specific estimates will be provided. If the protocol implements the pla nned treatment cha nge in response to safety monitoring for graft failure, then the analysis will be based on the stratum participants under the active treatment plan at the close of the study and results for the othe r participants w ill be described. Secondary Objectives: Secondary objectives include determining the effect of haploidentical BMT on clinical and laboratory manifest ations of SCD by 2 years after transplantation and determining the incidence of other transplant-related outcomes. Sec ondary outcomes include: overall survival post-haplo BMT at 1 and 2 years post-enrollment; EFS at 1 year; graft rejection; disease pr ogression; donor chimerism; grades II- IV and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD); chronic GVHD, severe chronic GVHD; neutr ophil, and platelet recovery; hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD); idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS); central nervous syst em (CNS) toxicity (reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy s yndrome [RPLS], hemorrhage, and seizures); cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection; adenovirus infection; Epstein Barr virus post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV PTLD); invasive fungal infection; CNS outcomes; 28 day e-pain diary assessments; health-"

Day 0 is the day of infusion with non T-cell depleted bone marrow. Cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg and Mesna 40mg/kg is given on Days +3 and +4, and GVHD prophylaxis (sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil) begin on Day +5. If it is determined that the graft failure rate in a stratum has met the stopping rule within the first 12 evaluable participants in the stratum, and approval from the DSMB and Sponsor is provided, then the conditioning regimen with TBI 400cGy instead of TBI 200cGy will be used for future pa rticipants in the stratum, and an additional 40 participants w ill be accrued to that stratum. Accrual Objective: The target sample size is 40 transplanted patients in each stratum; if the stopping rule for graft failure is triggered within the first 12 evaluable participants in either stratum using the 200cGy dose of TBI and the DSMB and sponsor approve the pre-defined switch in conditioning regimen, then accrual for that strata will restart under the m odified conditioning regimen. Accrual Period: The estimated accrual period is 4 years. If the safety monitoring for graft failure passes a stopping boundary within the first 12 evaluable participants, it is estimated that the accrual period will be extended up to an additional 15 months. Study Duration: Participants will be followed for the 28-day pain diary (prior to 70-day conditioning period) and for 2 years from date of infusion (post-transplant). Safety Monitoring: The rate of overall morta lity by Day 180 post start of hydroxyureatherapy pre-transplant, acute grade III-IV GVHD at 100 days, and severe chronic GVHD at 18 months post-transplant will be monitored by using a sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) for censored e xponential data for each of these. Graft failure at 100 days post-transplant will be monitored by using a sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) for binary data."

This mutation directs an amino acid substitution of valine for glutamic acid, which promotes the formation of long hemoglobin polymers under hypoxic conditions. 3,4,5 This propensity for polymer formation deforms the red blood cell (RBC) and causes significant alterations in red cell integrity, rheologic properties, and life span. 6 The presence of SCD with chronic hemolysis is directly or indirectly responsible for the vasculopathy that forms in virt ually all body organs. SCD is a heritable disorder of hemoglobin. One in every 1941 newborns regardless of race7 and 1 in every 400 African-American newborns8 in the United States have SCD. Approximately 80,000 to 100,000 persons in the United States are affected by SCD.9 This disease burden has a considerable impact on individuals affected and health-care systems. In the United States alone, the medical cost of caring for approximately 80,000 affected individuals exceeds $1 billion. 10 The course of SCD has dramatically changed over the last 40 years. Currently children born with SCD are expected to live through adolescence a nd young adulthood with > 95% expected to reach their 18th birthday.11 A recent prospective cohort study in ch ildren with the most severe disease (based on recurrent pain or acute chest syndrome episodes or other severe manifestations) have a 15 year estimated survival of 99% when pl aced on hydroxyurea therapy. In comparison, children from the same cohort with less se vere disease that were not pl aced on hydroxyurea therapy had an overall survival of 95%. These results are similar to a Brazilian cohort dem onstrating that children with more severe SCD that were placed hydroxyurea therapy had a higher survival rate than those with less severe disease that were not, (99·5% vs. 94·5%, P = 0·01), for a median of 2 years (range 0·1-6·5) .12 Taken together, these two studies suggest th at with appropriate anticipatory guidance for splenic sequestration, prompt management of fever, routin e vaccinations, and penicillin prophylaxis, SCD in children is no longer life threatening.11 1.1.1 Stroke and silent cerebral in farction in children with SCD The biggest challenge in managi ng children with SCD is the prev ention of strokes and silent cerebral infarcts. Once a stroke occurs, standard care for secondary prevention of overt strokes in children and adults with SCD includes regular blo od transfusion therapy to suppress synthesis of hemoglobin S (HbS).13 Without transfusion therapy, approx imately 67% of these children will have second overt strokes.14 The SWiTCH trial was the defi nitive randomized trial to test the hypothesis that hydroxyurea therapy with phlebotomy (altern ative therapy) was non-inferior to regular blood transfusion therapy and chelation (standard therapy) for second ary prevention of stroke recurrence. As part of the interim analysis, the trial was stopped prem aturely based on futility assessment for decreasing iron stores in the alternative therapy group. Howeve r, the rate of strokes in the alternative and standard therapy group was 10.5% (7 of 67) and 0% (0 of 66), In one of the few prospective trials conducted to determine the efficacy of blood transfusion therapy to prevent both overt and silent cerebral infarcts (infarcts that are not coincident with a focal neurological deficit) 40 children with"
16,page_16,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 16 SCD and overt strokes were enrolled at 7 academic centers and followed for a mean of 5.5 years. Despite the mean pre-transfusion hemoglobin S concentration of 29%, an optimal transfusion therapy goal, progressive cerebral infarcts occurred in 45% (18 of 40 children). 15 Figure 1. Survival free of new overt or silent cerebral infarcts in children with SCD while on transfusion therapy for secondary stroke prophylaxis. Participants with progressive overt and silent cerebral infarction, stratified for the absence (solid line) or the pr esence (dashed line) of progressive cerebral vasculopathy during chronic blood transfusion therapy. Vertical lines represent censored cases. Median ev ent-free interval for new silent or overt infarction was 3.2 years for the group with progressive vasculopathy, compared with median event-free interval not reached in the group without progressive vasculopathy (Mantel-Cox log-rank, P = .001). A much larger, but retrospective cohort consisti ng of 14 centers and including 137 children with sickle cell disease (SCD) and strokes were followed for a median of a decade. Over the course of a decade, approximately 22% had a second stroke despite regular blood transfusion therapy, and among those with a second stroke, appr oximately 30% had a third stroke.16 In both the retrospective and prospective studi es, participants had strokes when hemoglobin S levels were 1%, 9%, 22%, 25%, and 26%. The hemoglobin S levels at the time of the stroke recurrence were all < 30%, the maximum target percent for hemoglobin S concentration. Based on the compelling results from these studies and other large retrospective observational studies,17,18 blood transfusion therapy can only be considered palliative for secondary prevention of strokes."
17,page_17,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 17 Silent cerebral infarcts are the most common cause of neurological injury in children with SCD occurring in almost 40% before their 14th birthday.19 Recently our group completed a controlled randomized trial demonstrating this phenomenon in children with pre-existing silent cerebral infarcts. Those that received regular blood tran sfusion therapy for 36 months to keep their maximum hemoglobin S level less th an 30% had a 58% relative risk reduction of infarct recurrence when compared to observation. 20 Unfortunately, even among the children with silent cerebral infarcts that received regular blood transfusion th erapy, recurrent infarcts (both strokes and silent cerebral infarcts) still occurred.21 Thus, for children with overt st rokes and silent cerebral infarc ts, blood transfusion therapy to prevent cerebral infarct recurrence has to be continued indefinitely and is palliative. Alternative therapies must be pursued for this high -risk group. Haplo-identical tr ansplant may provide an alternative to blood transfusion therapy for second ary prevention of cerebral infarct recurrence. 1.1.2 Progressive Disease with a high mortality rate for adults with SCD In contrast to children where advances in medi cal care, public health a nd anticipatory guidelines have decreased the mortality, in adults with SCD the mortality rate has remained unchanged in large population based studies. In the most comprehensive study of SCD conducted, the Cooperative Study for Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD), from 1977 to 1998, the average life span for men and women with SCD was 42 and 48 years, respectively. Data from 1979 to 2005 from National Center for Health Sta tistic that included over 16,000 adults with SCD revealed that the median age of death was 38 and 42 years for men and women with SCD, respectively. With improvement in care for the adults, we know the biggest risk factors for earlier death in adults with SCD, however, we lack any definitive strategy to abate the progression of cardiopulmonary disease that leads to earlier mortality. An elevated triscuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRJV) remains the biggest risk factor associated with earlier death in adults with SCD. 21 In multi-institutional prospective cohort study, the rate of mortality for those with and without TRJV > 3 m/sec and < 3.0 m/sec respectively is shown in Figure 2.22 Currently there is no efficacious treatment for adults with TRJV > 3.0 m/sec. Hydroxyurea therapy is r ecommended by the American Thoracic Society; however, no randomized trial has b een conducted to demonstrate its efficacy. Sidenifil versus placebo was introduced as a therapy for elevated TRJV in a double blind randomized controlled clinical trial; however, the trial stopped prematurely because of the increased rate of vaso- occlusive pain events in the active treatment ar m. In prospective cohort study of 430 adults with SCD followed for approximately 5 years, Kassim et al. demonstrated that low forced expiratory volume in one second % predicted (FEV 1) is associated with a higher mortality rate. Again, understanding the risk factor for earlier death is important, however, there is no therapy for low FEV1% predicted in adults with SCD. Likewise, renal disease, which is common in adults with SCD, is also associated with higher mortalit y. In a prospective population study conducted by the CDC between 2005 and 2009, in adults with SCD and end stage renal disease that start dialysis, the rate of death in the first year after commencing dialysis was 26%. 23"

Kaplan Meier plot from the Walk Phast Cohort demonstrating the proportion alive in a cohort of adults with SCD that had TRJV > 3 m/sec (n=64) and < 2 m/sec. (n=508). In summary, adults with SCD have a significant ri sk of earlier death with no therapeutic option to prevent progression of end organ disease. The most debilitating complication is vaso-occlusiv e pain that occurs in a large proportion of adults with SCD. The only FDA approved treatment for prevention of vaso-occlusive pain events in SCD is hydroxyurea therapy; however, its effectiv eness in decreasing mort ality, particular in the subset of adults with severe pre-existing e nd organ disease is unclear. In a prospective cohort study that documented daily pain in a diary Smith et al., 24 demonstrated that majority 29.3% of adults with SCD reported pain a lmost every day in their diary days; whereas, only 14.2% reported pain in 5% or fewer diary days (adjusted). Most importantly when a patient reported that they had vaso-occlusive pain episode, referred to as cris es in the manuscript, only 22% of these episodes resulted in health care utilization; the remaining 78% of the acute pain episodes resulted in the adult electing to manage the crises at home. Given the increased rate of mortality associated with SCD in adults coupled with the crippling effects of vaso-occlusive pain episodes, individuals with evidence of end-organ-disease or debilitating vaso -occlusive pain events despite medical therapy, should be offered an option for cure. 1.2 Rapid disease progression in adults with SCD Natural history studies show that in contrast to the improvements in outcomes in childhood, there is a rapid progression in orga n damage, morbidity and prem ature mortality in adulthood. Progression of organ dama ge in adulthood is marked by pulm onary hypertension, which occurs in"
19,page_19,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 19 20-40% of adult patients with a 10 fold increase in risk of premature mortality,37 renal insufficiency with proteinuria in 70% and pr ogressing to renal failure in 11% , abnormal pulmonary function in 90% and progression to irreversible organ dama ge in 50% of patients by 50 years of age.42 One third develop chronic pain syndrome and only 20% are employed.43, 25 Death in adulthood is frequently related to organ dama ge which is not preventable or easily managed with current medical measures.42 SCD related complications such as le g ulcers, stroke, priapism, vascular necrosis, anxiety, and depression further worsen the health related quality of life. The mortality rate of patients with SCD is 5.8-20% in the first 10 years after transition to adult care. 28,43 Premature death occurs at a median age of 38 years, a statistic that has not changed in 20 years42,26 (Figure 3). In a long-term follow-up study of pati ents with symptomatic SCD who were eligible to participate in the multicenter study of hydr oxyurea (MSH), the annual mortality rate was 4.4 per 100 person-years among adults with SCD who sa tisfied eligibility criteria, which is 4.4%. Figure 3. Steep decline in probability of survival in adulthood in patients with sickle cell disease1 Thus, the inexorable progression of disease a nd premature mortality in adulthood provides the strong rationale for intensifying th e investigation and development of curative therapies in this group of patients. 1.3 HCT is a therapeutic option for SCD Supportive health care measures instituted dur ing childhood, which include newborn screening and pneumococcal prophylaxis, the administra tion of hydroxyurea and regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions, have decreased the risk of serious infections and other life-threatening complications, resulting in improved survival to adulthood. This has, in part, shifted the demographics of SCD to include a growing proportion of young adults with chronic health impairments. Sickle cell disease is considered a life threatening disease in adults. Multiple studies have demonstrated that adults with SCD, particularly those with co-morbidities have a shortened life span. 27 Even with the most recent use of hydroxyur ea therapy, the only F DA disease modifying therapy for SCD, the life expectancy for SCD is still in the mid-40s.28"
20,page_20,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 20 As an alternative to chronic supportive care, hematopoietic cell transp lantation (HCT) from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor has been used sparingly in children, but is curative in the majority of children treated.4,10 Event-free probabilities of 90 – 95% have been reported after HLA-ID sibling HCT using cord blood or marrow as the source of hematopoietic cells, for the most part after myeloablative preparation.9,29,30,31,32,33,34 However, the application of BMT in children with SCD is pursued very infrequently today, despite these compelling results. The most important reason why so few are treated is that most patients lack a suitable donor. Based upon current estimates, which project that 14% will have a HLA-identical donor35 and recent projections published by the NMDP in whic h the likelihood of identifying a well-matched unrelated marrow donor is 18% am ong African-American recipients,36 it is estimated that two- thirds of patients will not be able to pursue transplant ation. We hypothesize that HLA haplo- identical transplant is an alternative to blood transfusion therapy for secondary prevention of cerebral infarct recurrence and in abating the morbidity from the age-dependent chronic organ dysfunction in adult patients who lack a well-matched donor. 1.4 HCT for SCD – conditioning regimens Even when it is clear that allogeneic BMT can decrease or eliminate sickle cell disease-related complications 30, myeloablative transplantation can cause toxicities such as GVHD, infertility and importantly, a fixed risk of transplantation-related mortality that has caused families and their providers to seek alternative safer therapies, even when the latter lack curative potential. Recently, progress in the development of reduced intensity conditioning regimens that facilitate the sustained engraftment of donor marrow with reduced toxicity has occurre d. Most of these regimens incorporate highly immunosuppressive purine analogue s, such as fludarabine, which allow the reduction or elimination of myeloablative agents such as busul fan or total body i rradiation and still sustain engraftment of HLA-iden tical allogeneic stem cells. Early attempts to use a non-my eloablative conditioning regimen for HLA-identical sibling BMT for sickle cell disease were unsuccessful. In thes e trials, an initial wa ve of donor engraftment typically was observed, but the disease invariably recurred when post-grafting immunosuppression was withdrawn 6. To investigate the cause of this failur e, a group at the NIH led by John Tisdale studied sirolimus in a preclinical model and determined that this agent was more effective than standard calcineurin inhibitors at establishing bidirectional donor- host tolerance. His team tested this approach in humans, and Hsieh et al demo nstrated stable donor engraftment in adult SCD patients following non-myeloablative HCT from HLA-matched sibling donors. 29,30 Between 2004 and 2013, thirty patients w ith severe disease who were 16 to 65 years of age were treated by a nonmyeloablative combination of alemtuzumab (1mg /kg in divided doses), total-body irradiation (300 cGy), and sirolimus followed by HLA-ID sib ling filgrastim mobilized peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Sirolimus alone was used for GVHD prophylaxis and 87% of recipients had long-term engraftment without acu te or chronic GVHD. While sirolimus was discontinued in 15 of 30 recipients, in the remaining recipients it was extended due to lymphohematopoietic chimerism that was judged too low to prevent a late graft rejection. Th e selection of sirolimus appeared pivotal to the very good outcome because of its inhibito ry effect on effector T-cell proliferation and viability while preserving T-regulatory cells that are required for tolerance, and because sirolimus does not appear to cause posteri or reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) unlike other calcineurin inhibitors. PRES has been observed in approximately 10 - 20% of sickle"
21,page_21,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 21 cell recipients who receive cyclosporine post-HC T for GVHD prevention, and is thus a leading contributor to adverse events after HCT for SCD.31,37 Thus, it appears that reduced intensity transplantation regimens that include immunoablation after tr eatment might be especially important to ensure donor engraftment after HCT for SCD. This aspect will carry even greater importance in the setting of HLA-mismatched donor transplantation that will be needed to tackle the problem of limited matched dono r availability as a barrier to transplantation. Therefore, developing novel strategies that address the i ssue of expanding the donor pool while ensuring a low rate of graft rejection are potentially transformative to curative therapy for SCD. 1.5 Haploidentical HCT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide In the past five years, investigators at J ohns Hopkins have devel oped a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen for transp lantation of marrow from partially HLA-mismatched, or haploidentical, bone marrow from first-degree re latives. The regimen’s main goal, J9966 (RPN 99-11-05-01), was to titrate the dose of pre- a nd post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (CY), a potent immunosuppressive drug, give n in conjunction with pre-tr ansplantation fludarabine and total body irradiation (TBI), to achieve a regimen th at had an acceptably low risk of graft rejection and GVHD, the two major complications of haploi dentical bone marrow transplantation (BMT). All patients received my cophenolate mofetil (MMF) and tacro limus (FK), beginning on day 4 or 5 and terminating on days 35 a nd 50-180, respectively, to reduce th e incidence and severity of GVHD. The first cohort of three patients received no pre-transplantation CY and 50 mg/kg CY IV on day 3, and two of the patients rejected their grafts. A second cohort of 20 patients received 14.5 mg/kg CY IV on days –6 and –5 in addition to 50 mg/kg IV on day 3. Of 18 evaluable patients, 13 patients had donor engraftment on day 60, but accr ual of patients to this dose level was stopped because 8/13 patients developed severe GVHD, an incidence convincingly in excess of the stopping criterion of 20%. To reduce the incidence of GVHD, a third cohort of patients received an additional dose of CY 50 mg/kg IV on day 4, and MMF dosing was increased from bid to tid, based upon pharmacokinetic data suggesting the need for more frequent dosing. Of seventeen evaluable patients so far, two patients have had non-fatal graft rejection, and only one patient treated according to the protocol has had seve re GVHD (an additional patie nt developed severe GVHD after withdrawal of immunosuppression to treat relapse). Two patients died of causes other than relapse: one from GVHD, and the other from disseminated fungal infection. Of the 16 patients who have been followed up to 100 days for relapse, 8 have relapsed at a median of 64 days (range 24-~100) after transplantation, a nd 6 patients are alive and disease free at a median of 206 days (range, 100-429 days [as of Feb 8, 2014]) following BMT. 38 In order to better judge the safety and efficacy of the non-myeloablative BMT protocol, the tables below compare the results of J9966, dose level 3, to the results of the four largest published trials of HLA-identical sibling peripheral blood versus bone marrow transplantation for early stage leukemia."

The highe r rate of relapse for patients on J9966 may be attributable to a benefit of myeloablative cond itioning in reducing the risk of relapse, or that patients on J 9966 had advanced, poor prognosis he matologic maligna ncies, which relapse more frequently than early leukemia after allogeneic BMT. Since the toxicities of non-myeloa blative haploidentical BMT (h aploBMT) were not known when the trial was written, eligibility for J9966 was restricted to pa tients with advanced, poor-risk hematologic malignancies, such as chronic myeloid leukemia in 2nd chronic phase, advanced myelodysplasia, acute leukemia in 2nd remission, and lymphoma in relapse after autologous BMT. Eligibility on the protocol has been expanded to ‘standard risk’ hematologic malignancies in trial J0457, which is ongoing. Between J9966 and J0457, 56 patient s with hematologic malignanc ies received cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg IV, either once (on day 3) or tw ice (on days 3 and 4) after non-myeloablative"
23,page_23,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 23 conditioning and haploidentical bone marrow transplant. Most of these patients had advanced disease or failed a previous autologous transp lant. All were conditione d as outpatients with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, a nd total body irradiation, transpla nted with non-T cell-depleted marrow, and treated with tacrolimus and mycophe nolate mofetil beginning the day after the last dose of cyclophosphamide. The most interesting finding was that compared to patients receiving a single dose of post-transplant cyclophosphamide, those receiving two doses had significantly less grade II-IV aGVHD (43% vs. 78%; p=.01) and grade III-IV aGVHD (20% vs. 53%; p=.006) by day 200 after transplant. Death from GVHD occu rred in 5/13 assessable patients receiving one dose versus 2/28 assessable patients re ceiving 2 doses of cyclophosphamide. Since the data to date suggest that this treatment regimen may be as safe as HLA-identical sibling BMT after myeloablative conditi oning, non-myeloablative haploiden tical BMT may be considered a reasonable treatment option for patients who ha ve severe SCD. Also, the novel use of post- transplant cyclophosphamide with a reduced inte nsity conditioning emerges as an interesting option of immunotherapy to prevent graft rejection. Moreover, as ca ncer relapse is not a concern in the setting of SCD, engraftment with non-myel oablative hematopoi etic stem cell transplantation should be curative. In clinical transplanta tion, antithymocyte globulin (ATG) has been used extensively in conventional myeloablative an d non-myeloablative conditioning regimens to facilitate engraftment in patients with sickle cell disease.9 This effect is largely mediated by in vivo T-cell depletion produced by the ATG, similar to the effect of monoc lonal T-cell antibodies in the murine model. These preliminary data have relied upon the admini stration of donor marrow in lieu of umbilical cord blood or mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells, which is an impor tant consideration in this non-malignant condition. The use of mobilized peripheral blood progenito r cells for malignant and non-malignant diseases is associated with higher risk of chronic GVHD compared to bone marrow. It is well recognized that chronic GVHD adds to the burden of morbidity and mortality. In particular, for non-malignant diseases where th ere is not a need for graft versus tumor effect, there are no advantages to transplantation of pe ripheral blood. In patients with severe aplastic anemia, the most common non-malignant indicati on for transplantation, chronic GVHD risks are higher after transplantation of peripheral blood co mpared to bone marrow and mortality risks are higher after transplantation of peripheral bl ood from HLA-matched si bling and HLA-matched unrelated donors. 39 In addition, graft failure rates are high after unrelated UCB transplantation for SCD. Data from CIBMTR/Eurocord reported an event-free survival was 50% for children with sickle cell disease (the predominant cause of failure was graft rejection). 40 The cord blood arm of the recently completely BMT CTN 0601 (unrel ated donor transplantation for children and adolescents with sickle cell disease) was closed early for excess graft failure.41 Together, the preliminary data presented belo w with the published evidence about the use of cord blood and mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells in sickle cell disease strongly support the use of marrow in this study. 1.6 Haploidentical HCT for S CD – preliminary results The single center experience from Johns Hopki ns includes 38 patients with SCD who were screened and 36 (95%) who proceeded to transplant ation.

Of the 36 patients transplanted, 5 had matched sibling donors and 31 had HLA haploidentical donors. All five patients who received matched sibling donor transplants are alive and engrafted (4 mixed chimerism and 1 with full donor chimerism). In patients who received transplants from an HLA haploidentical donor 22/31 had st able engraftment of donor cells (71%). All patients with secondary graft failure recovere d host hematopoiesis and surviv e with autologous reconstitution of SCD. The overall incidence of cGVHD is 5.8%. The last 5 consecutive patients who were transplanted (patients 32-36) received TBI in creased from 200cGy to 400cGy. All 5 of these patients survive beyond day 60 with 100% donor chimerism. While these results are very good with regard to tr ansplant-related toxicity , there is a clear need for improvement with regard to mitigating disease recurrence. Experimental data using high dose cyclophosphamide has clearly shown that in order to increase engraftment efficiency there are strategies that might be followed: increase the in tensity of the conditioning (such as increasing the dose of TBI or adding additional agents to the pre- transplant regimen) or increase the cell dose of the graft. 42,43 In this study, the former was adopted in the form of adding thiotepa to the conditioning regimen in order to ab rogate the host-versus-graft rej ection and to ge nerate partial marrow ablation to promote the engraftment of donor cells. We did not find that G-CSF mobilization as a method to increase the ce ll dose improved donor engr aftment; thus, it was discontinued. We recently increased the TBI dos e in our conditioning regimen from 200 to 400 cGy with early results as noted above. There is evidence that thiotepa is an active agent in the conditioning regimen for hemoglobin disorders that addresses the difficulty of donor en graftment after allogeneic transplantation. In a report by La Nasa et al, an investigation de monstrated that a combination of Bu/TT/CY conditioning in the initial series of 32 patients that received URD transplantation had a Transplant Related Mortality (TRM) of 19% and a disease-free survival probability of 69%. The Bu/TT/CY regimen later was replaced with Bu/Flu/TT in th e subsequent series, in 17 patients who received a combination of Bu/Flu with thiotepa, the TRM was 0% and thalassemia free survival was 77% after HCT. Bernardo et al substituted busulfa n with its dihyroxy derivative treosulfan and demonstrated updated data in 60 patients (40 UR D and 20 matched related donor (MRD) recipients indicating an overall survival of 93% and thalassemia free survival of 84%. 44) Finally, a recent UHSRUW RI  FRQVHFXWLYH SDUHQWDO  KDSORLGHQWLFDO WUDQVSODQWV   ZLWK 6&' DQG RQH ZLWK ȕ thalassemia major) from St. Mary ’s Hospital, London was repor ted at the 2015 EBMT meeting. Eleven of the 12 patients survive with partial or full donor chimerism after receiving a preparative regimen of fludarabine 150 mg/m2, thiotepa 10 mg/kg, cyclophosphamide 29 mg/kg, TBI 2 Gy and ATG (Thymoglobulin) 4.5 mg/kg with HU, hype r-transfusion and azathioprine administered 2 months before commencing the conditioni ng regimen. Patients received cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg on days +3 and +4, MMF and sirolimus for post-grafting immunosuppression (Delafuente et al EBMT 2015). Taken together, these da ta demonstrate steady improvement in donor engraftment was associated with thiotepa, and that the safety profile has been acceptable. Thus, we propose to add this drug to the conditioni ng regimen to address the problem of graft rejection/disease recurrence after haploBMT."

27,page_27,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 27 reported in 2004.47 Thirty-seven of these individuals survive free of SCD with an 8-year estimate of DFS that is 97.1%, and which is significantly hi gher compared to the DFS in those who did not receive HU before HCT (P<0.001). Together, these da ta strongly suggest that HU might be safely administered in advance of tran splantation to exert its immunos uppressive and myelosuppressive effects to promote engraftment of donor cells. 1.7 Disease Severity in SCD and transplant eligibility The application of experimental HCT therapy in SCD must strike a balance between the underlying disease severity and the possibility of a direct benefit of the treatment, particularly in pediatric populations. Thus, the SCD subjects ta rgeted for enrollment are patient s at risk for early mortality and progressive global organ damage, as occurs in adults, and also children at risk for progressive brain injury following an initial cerebral infarction, for whom the possibility of a curative outcome will have the greatest impact. In these two groups, there are compelling reasons to consider an investigational transplant option. 1.7.1 Lack of curative treatments for adults with SCD The prevailing framework of clinical research in SCD shifts in the transition from childhood to adulthood. Among pediatric hematologists, the domin ant view is that survival to adulthood is excellent, and that children, on average, have a very good quality of life as a result of supportive care measures such as antibiotics, family educat ion, and the judicious use of transfusions. In addition, a great deal of effort has focused on id entifying children who have high-risk features, so that the risk of any specific intervention might be balanced by the severity of disease in that individual. Thus, clinical resear ch studies in children with SCD have focused primarily on safety and efficacy, often in the setting of a high-risk p opulation, such as children at risk for a stroke. While HCT has curative potential, its routine application remains quite limited in children with SCD, due in part to its toxicities which include a risk of dying from the procedure itself. As a result, clinical studies of transplantation in ch ildren with SCD have suffered from poor accrual and despite excellent disease-free survival, HCT is not routinely considered in children with SCD. In contrast, the prevailing view am ong clinicians who care for adults is that SCD is, on average, a severe disease with a significant risk of sudde n death and the development of chronic medical problems and that supportive care options for young a dult patients are not ade quate to address the overwhelming nature of this diseas e. Thus, clinical studies in a dults with SCD have focused on interventions that prolong survival and improve the quality of life. Unlike children, adults with SCD are much more likely to have a debilitating co mplication. As a result, the risk/benefit ratio of HCT is very favorable in adults, pa rticularly if an approach to HCT that defines an acceptable level of toxicity can be established. If successful, such an approach could significantly improve the outlook of many adults with SCD a nd broaden the therapeutic choices."

Estimate overall survival at one year and two years after enrollment and after haploBMT. 2. Estimate EFS at one year after haploBMT. 3. Estimate incidence of primary and sec ondary graft rejection at one and two years after haploBMT. 4. Estimate incidence and se verity of acute GVHD until Day 100 then chronic GVHD at six months, one year, 18 mont hs, and two years post-transplant. 5. Characterize donor hematopoietic chimerism in peripheral blood at days 28, 42, 100, and 180 and at 1 and 2 years after haploBMT. 6. Characterize hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities of haploBMT, including the incidence and severity of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease; time to and probability of re d blood cell, neutrophil, and platelet recovery; hepatic veno-occlusive di sease (VOD); idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS); central nervous system (CNS) toxicity (reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome [RPLS] , hemorrhage, and seizures); cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection; adenoviru s infection; Epstein Barr virus post- transplant lymphoproliferative disease (E BV PTLD); invasive fungal infection. 7. Evaluate if sickle vasculopat hy is halted by successful tran splantation as determined by comparing brain MRI pre- and 2 years post- haploBMT. Cerebral MRI/MRA is required for only pediatric patients enrolled under a neur ologic indication to assess status of CNS disease. For adults where the indication for the transplant is a stroke, cerebral MRI/MRA is required after transplant to as sess progression of CNS disease. 8. Estimate disease recurrence at one and two years after haplo BMT."

Iron chelation therapy or a program of phlebotomy may be resumed after neutrophil and red cell recovery at the discretion of the transplant center. 2.4.2.5 Hydroxyurea Hydroxyurea (30 mg/kg/day) will be commenced as a single daily oral dose on Day -70 and continued through Day -10. Hydroxyur ea will be adjusted to the ideal body weight (IBW) in children and adults weighing > 125% IBW. A CBC will be obtained weekly and the dose will be reduced if the ANC<1500 or platelet < 100,000. HU will be discontinued on Day -10. 2.4.2.6 Thymoglobulin Thymoglobulin (rATG) will be infused through a 0.22 micron filter with pre-medications to include: Oral or intravenous (IV) acetaminophe n and diphenhydramine. An anaphylaxis kit will be kept at bedside during Thymoglobulin adminis tration. The dose will be 0.5 mg/kg IV on Day - 9 over 6 hours and 2 mg/kg IV on Days -8 and -7 over 4 hours. Solumedrol should be administered per institutional standard to prevent infusional toxicity. An intradermal skin test prior to dose of Thymoglobulin may be performed per institutional practice. 2.4.2.7 Thiotepa Thiotepa 5 mg/kg will be administered IV every 12 hours over 2 hours or per institutional guidelines on Day -7 (administer 2 doses to total 10 mg/kg). Thiotepa will be adjusted to the ideal body weight (IBW) in children weighing > 125% IBW. 2.4.2.8 Fludarabine Fludarabine 30 mg/m 2/day will be administered over 30-60 minutes intravenous infusion on Days –6 through –2 for a total dose of 150 mg/m2. Fludarabine will be dosed according to the recipient’s actual body weight. Patients who have an estima ted or measured creatinine clearance < 70 mL/min/1.73 m2 are excluded from enrollment, thus there will be no adjustment in the fludarabine dose for renal insufficiency. 2.4.2.9 Pre-transplantation Cyclophosphamide Hydration prior to cyclophosphamide may be give n according to institutional standards. A recommended approach is as follows: Patients are instruct ed to increase fluids overnight before cyclophosphamide administration. Hydr ation with normal saline at 3 mL/kg/hr IV will be started 2 hours prior to cyclophosphamide, then the rate will be reduced to 2 mL/kg/hr for 1 hour pre- cyclophosphamide and continued at 2 mL/ kg/hr for 8 hours post-cyclophosphamide. Mesna may be administered per institutional standards. Mesna dose will be based on the cyclophosphamide dose being given. The total daily dose of mesna must be equal to 80% of the total daily dose of Cy. A suggested approach is as follows: divided doses IV 30 min pre-Cy and at 3, 6, and 8 hours post-Cy. Cyclophosphamide 14.5 mg/kg/day will be administe red as a 1-2 hour intravenous infusion on"

Cyclophosphamide will be dosed a ccording to the recipient’s ideal body weight (IBW), unless the patient weighs more than 125% of IBW, in which case the drug will be dosed according to the adjusted IBW (AIBW; see S ection 2.4.2.3 for formulas). Uroprotection can be administered according to institutional guidelines. Mesna is recommended to accompany pre- transplantation Cy but is not required. Cyclophosphamide will be dosed according to the recipient’s ideal body weight (IBW), unless actual body weight is less than IBW, in which ca se use actual body weight. If the patient weighs greater than125% of IBW, cyclophosphamide will be dosed according to the adjusted IBW (AIBW). 2.4.2.10 Total Body Irradiation 200 cGy TBI will be administered in a single frac tion on Day –1. Radiation sources and dose rates will be defined by the institution. TBI may be delivered from eith er linear accelerator or Cobalt sources. Graft may be infused on th e same day as TBI administrati on as long as there is 4-6 hours between administration of TBI and infusion of bone marrow. If graft failure rate exceeds that specified in the 100-day safety monitoring guideline for graft rejection and notice is provided to all centers by the DCC, then future participants will be administered 400 cGy TBI in a single fraction on Day -1. For either the 200cGy TBI or 400cGy TBI, gonadal shielding will be used in all male patients. Gonadal shielding will not be used in females. 2.4.3 Bone marrow transplantati on and graft information On Day 0, patients will receive unprocessed bone marrow unless there is a major ABO incompatibility, in which case red blood cells w ill be depleted from the donor marrow using institutional practices. Institutional practices will determine if there will be processing for minor ABO incompatibilities. Donor bone marrow w ill be harvested to minimum yield of 2.5 x 10 8 with a target yield of 4 x 108 nucleated cells per kilogram of recipient’s IBW or actual BW (ABW), whichever BW is lower. We recommend taking no mo re than 10 mL per aspirate. In addition to calculating the total nucleated cell dose /kg, flow cy tometry will need to be done on the sample to determine the content of CD34+cells. The use of cryopreserve d marrow is not permitted. 2.4.4 Post-Transplantation cyclophosphamide Cyclophosphamide 50mg/kg will be given as an IV infusion over 1-2 hours (depending on volume) on Day 3 post-transplant (between 60 and 72 hour s after marrow infusi on) and on Day 4 post- transplant (24 hours afte r Day 3 cyclophosphamide). Corticosteroids may not be used as anti-emetic agent and should not be administered until 24 hours after the completion of post-transplant cyclophos phamide unless used for adrenal support or during a medical emergency (e.g., tr eatment of anaphylaxis). 2.4.5 GVHD prophylaxis On Day 5, patients will begin prophylaxis with Sirolimus and Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF)."
38,page_38,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 38 2.4.5.1 Sirolimus Sirolimus for participants 18.00 years old : A one-time sirolimus loading dose, 6 mg PO, is given on Day 5, at least 24 hours after Cyclophospha mide completion. Sirolimus is then continued at a maintenance dose (start 2 mg PO QD), w ith dose adjustments to maintain a trough of 5 – 15 ng/mL as measured by HPLC or immunoassay . There is no planned taper. Sirolimus prophylaxis is discontinued after the last dose on Day 365 or may be continued if there is GVHD. Sirolimus troughs should be measured weekly at a minimum. Sirolimus for participants < 18.00 years old : Sirolimus dosing is based on actual body weight; however, an adjusted body weight may be used if the actual weight is > 50% greater than IBW. A one-time sirolimus loading dose, 3 mg/m2 PO with the dose not to exceed 6 mg, is given on Day 5, at least 24 hours after Cyclophosphamide comp letion. Sirolimus is then continued at a maintenance dose (start 1 mg/m2 PO QD, maximum 2 mg PO QD), with dose adjustments to maintain a trough of 3 – 12 ng/mL as measured by HPLC or imm unoassay. There is no planned taper. Sirolimus prophylaxis is di scontinued after the last dose on Day 365 or may be continued if there is GVHD. 2.4.5.2 Mycophenolate Mofetil MMF will be given at a dose of 15 mg/kg PO TID (based upon actual body weight) with the maximum total daily dose not to exceed 3 grams (1 g PO TID). MMF prophylaxis will begin on Day 5 post-transplant and will be discontinued after the last dose on Day 35 or may be continued if active GVHD is present. 2.4.6 Encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) If the local team elects Encephaloduroarterios ynangiosis (EDAS) to be performed prior to transplant as adjunctive therapy for secondary stroke prevention, then it is strongly recommended to delay the initiation of pre-tr ansplant hydroxyurea treatment at least 6 months due to the minimum time expected for the revascularization to benefit from the engrafted vessel. Since hydroxyurea is a myelosuppressive agent, treatme nt with hydroxyurea may impede healing of the new engrafted vessels after the revascularization procedure. 2.4.7 Additional Supportive Care Ursodiol should begin at time of hydroxyurea cond itioning (Day -70) in all patients. Supportive care for VOD will follow institutional practice. Th ere is a significant risk of intracranial hemorrhage after HCT in patients with SCD and stroke. For this reason and because of inconsistent efficacy, heparin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are not permitted for VOD/SOS prophylaxis. 48,49"
39,page_39,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 39 2.4.8 Infection Prophylaxis Participants will receive inf ection prophylaxis and nutritional support according to institutional guidelines. Infection prophylaxis should include, but is not limited to, agents or strategies (e.g., PCR screening and preemptive ther apy) to reduce the risk of b acterial, herpes simplex, CMV, HHV-6, EBV, Pneumocystis jiroveci, and fungal infections. Penicillin prophylaxis or its equivalent should be admin istered per institutional st andard due to asplenism that occurs in sickle cell disease. 2.4.9 EBV Monitoring It is recommended that patients will have EBV DNA quantitative PCR testing on peripheral blood every two weeks from Day 14 to Day 100. In the event of persistent EBV virema or signs/symptoms consistent with EBV-related post-transp lant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD, adenopathy, fever, etc.) therapy with rituximab is recommended pe r local instituti onal standard. 2.4.10 Transfusion Support The hemoglobin level must be maintained between 9.0 and 11.0 g/dL and platelet count 50,000/mm3 after transplantation until transfusion independent to minimize the risk of neurological adverse events. Irra diated blood products should be administered universally, and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) negative or leuko-f iltered blood products are recommended for CMV sero-negative recipients. 2.4.11 Indwelling Central Venous Catheter Placement of a double or triple lumen central venous catheter will be required for the transplantation procedure and ad ministration of IV medications and transfusion of blood products. This catheter may be removed and replaced as cl inically indicated. However, the graft MUST be infused through a central line. 2.4.12 Prevention of post-BMT Neurological Events and Posterior Revers ible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) Prophylaxis against seizures is ma ndatory in all recipients and should be commenced at the start of thymoglobulin conditioning. Suitable drugs fo r prophylaxis should be administered according to institution guidelines. Seizure prophylaxis should be continued for 365 days after transplant or until sirolimus is discontinued, whic hever is later. Serum magnesium level should be maintained > 1.5 mg/dL during the period of treatment to reduce the risk of seizures. Hypertension should be strictly c ontrolled to prevent central nervous system (CNS) toxicity. Blood pressure should be monitored clos ely and both systolic and diasto lic hypertension should be treated promptly to maintain blood pressure at the patient’s pre-transplant baseline. Explicit orders must be written to intervene if systo lic or diastolic blood pressure exceeds 10% over baseline. Detailed guidelines for management of Posterior Reve rsible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) are included in Appendix I."

Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulati on methods) and withdraw al are not acceptable methods of contraception. Male subjects (even if surgically sterilized) must agree to one of the following: practice effective barrier contraception, or practice true abstinence wh en this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject, from the time of signi ng of informed consent through 12 months post- transplant. Periodic abstinence a nd withdrawal are not acceptabl e methods of contraception. 2.4.15 Management of Slow Engr aftment and Graft Failure Slow engraftment or gr aft failure shall be managed accordi ng to institutional practices and may include the administration of colony stimula ting factors and pro phylactic antibiotics. Graft failure following BMT in patients with sickle cell disease is usually associated with autologous reconstitution of the bone marrow with host hematopoiesis. It is associated with a steady decline in donor chimerism, increasing repr esentation of hemoglobin S (in the absence of ongoing RBC transfusion therapy) and clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease. A second transplant or donor cellular infusion should not be considered unless the patient has < 5% donor chimerism. 2.5 Study Drug Information 2.5.1 Fludarabine Fludarabine phosphate is co mmercially available. Fludarabine phosphate is purin e antimetabolite that, after ad ministration, undergoes rapid conversion in plasma to the nucleoside 2-fluoro ar a-A (F-araA). F-araA subsequently enters cells where it is phosphorylated to F-araATP and the monophosphate F-araAMP. Once activated, F- araATP inhibits DNA polymerase and ribonucle otide reductase. The monophosphate F-araAMP, once incorporated into DNA, is an effective DNA chain terminator. Fludarabine monophosphate, 50 mg/vial, is reconstitu ted with 2 ml of sterile water, resulting in a 25mg/ml solution. The desired dose is further dilute d to concentrations of 0.04-1 mg/ml in normal saline or 5% dextrose (50-100ml) for injection and will be administered by IV infusion over 30 minutes or longer."
41,page_41,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 41 Following IV administration, the drug is metabolized to 2-F-araA and widely distributed in tissues. 2-F-araA is excreted primarily in urine and has a terminal elimination hal f-life of 7 to 12 hours. Clinical toxicities of fludarabine monopho sphate include myel osuppression, primarily lymphopenia and granulocytopeni a, alopecia, rash, dermatitis, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, stomatitis, diarrhea, somnolence, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, ment al status changes, cortical blindness, hepatocellular toxic ity with elevation in serum transaminase, and interstitial pneumonitis. These effects are reversible when the drug is discontinued. Fludarabine may cause dose-re lated CNS toxicity, including the posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), acute to xic leukoencephalopat hy (ATL) and other leukoencephalopathy conditions (OLE). PRES is us ually reversible with supportive care. Typical clinical features include seizures, persistent headache, and vision changes, accompanied by variable mental status altera tions. Patients with ATL can pr esent with cognitive dysfunction, decreased levels of consciousness, and vision ch anges. Other leukoencephalopathy (OLE) includes patients who behave simila r to the ATL group, but with less pr ominent deep white matter changes on MRI. Both ATL and OLE are less likely to be reversible50. Fludarabine will be administered by IV infusion over 30 minutes in a dose of 30 mg/m2/day on Days -6 to -2. 2.5.2 Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan®) Cyclophosphamide is commercially available. Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent which pr events cell division primarily by cross-linking DNA strands. Cyclophosphamide is cell cycle non-specific. Cyclophosphamide for injection is available in 200 0 mg vials which are reconstituted with 100 ml sterile water for injection. The concentration of the rec onstituted product is 20 mg/ml. The calculated dose will be diluted fu rther in 250-500 ml of Dextrose 5% in water. Each dose will be infused over 1-2 hr (depending on the total volume). Clinical toxicities of cyclophosphamide include alopecia, nausea and vomiting, headache and dizziness, hemorrhagic cystitis, cardiot oxicity, immunosuppression, myelosuppression, pulmonary fibrosis, increased hepatic enzymes and syndrome of inappr opriate anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH). 2.5.3 Mesna (sodium-2-mercapto ethane sulphonate) Mesna is a prophylactic agent used to prev ent hemorrhagic cystitis induced by the oxasophosphorines (cyclophosphamide a nd ifosphamide). It has no in trinsic cytotoxicity and no antagonistic effects on chemotherapy. Mesna binds with acrolein, the urotoxic metabolite produced by the oxasophosphorines, to produce a non-toxi c thioether and slows the rate of acrolein formation by combining with 4-hydr oxy metabolites of oxasophosphorines. Mesna is available in 200 mg, 400 mg and 1000 mg vials containing a 100 mg/ml solution. Each dose of mesna will be diluted further in 50 ml of normal saline to be infused over 15 minutes (or"
42,page_42,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 42 as per institutional standards). Mesna dose will be based on the cyclophosphamide dose being given. The total daily dose of mesna is equal to 80% of the total daily dose of cyclophosphamide. At the doses used for uroprotection mesna is vi rtually non-toxic. However, adverse effects which may be attributable to mesna in clude nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, altered taste, rash, urticaria, headache, joint or limb pain, hypotension and fatigue. 2.5.4 Thiotepa Antineoplastic and alkylating agent, that re acts with DNA phosphate groups to produce cross- linking of DNA strands leading to inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis; mechanism of action has not been explored as thoroughly as the other alkylating agents, it is presumed that the aziridine rings open and react as nitrogen mustard; reactivity is enhanced at a lower pH. No dosage adjustment provided in manufactur er’s labeling. For renal or hepa tic impairment, caution and dose adjustment may be required. Extensively hepatic; major metabolite (active): TEPA. Half-life elimination: Terminal ( dose-dependent clearance): ~2 hours; excretion: Urine (as metabolites and unchanged drug) Solution Reconstituted, Injection: Generic: 15 mg (1 ea); I.V.: Administer as a rapid injection. Infusion times may be longer for high- dose (unlabeled use) treatment. The most common adverse reactions include: Fertility effects: May be mutagenic and teratogenic; Myelosuppression, secondary mali gnancies: Potentially carcinog enic; myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been repor ted; Use with caution in participants with hepatic and renal impairment; dosage reduction recommended. It can cause significant skin toxicity due to lipid solubility, thus bathing th ree times daily during its administration through 24 hours after the last dose is strongly recommended. 2.5.5 Sirolimus (rapamycin, Rapamune®) Sirolimus is an immunosuppressant that inhibi ts cytokine-stimulated T-cell activation and proliferation, and also inhibits antibody formation. The mean bioavailability of sirolimus after administration of the tablet is ~27% higher than the oral solution. Sirolimus oral tablets are not bioequivalent to the oral solution. Clinical equi valence has been demonstrated at the 2mg dose level; however, it is not known if higher doses are clinically equivalent on an mg to mg basis. 2.5.5.1 Sirolimus oral solution Sirolimus oral solution (1 mg/mL) should be stored protected from light and refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). For dilution, the appropriate dose should be measured using an amber oral syringe, then added to a glass or plastic container that holds at le ast 60 mL. Before taking the dose, it should be diluted with water or orange juice then taken immediat ely; it should not be diluted with grapefruit juice. The syringe should be di scarded after one use. Sirolimus oral solution provided in bottles may develop a slight haze wh en refrigerated, which does not affect product quality; allow the product to stand at room temperat ure and shake gently until the haze disappears."

Sirolimus tablets should be stored at 20° to 25° C (68° –77°F), protected from light. The most common adverse reactions of sirolimus are peripheral ed ema, hypertriglyceride mia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, increased creatinine, constipation, abdominal pai n, nausea, diarrhea, headache, fever, urinary tract infection, an emia, thrombocytopenia, arthralgia , pain. Adverse reactions that have resulted in rates of sirolimus discontinuation >5% were increased creatinine, hypertriglyceridemia, and thrombotic thro mbocytopenic purpura (TTP) / thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Sirolimus toxicities are summarized: 2.5.6 Summary of Sirolimus Toxicities Common (>20%) Occasional (5-20%) Rare (<5%) Immediate (within 1-2 days) Headache (L), hypertension (L), immunosuppression (L), fever, nausea, diarrhea, constipation Chest pain, insomnia, dyspepsia, vomiting, dyspnea Hypotension, asthma, cough, flu-like syndrome, tachycardia, anorexia, hypersensitivity reactions Prompt (within 2-3 weeks) Tremor (L), renal dysfunction, pain (abdominal, back, arthralgias), hyperlipidemia c (hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia), hyperglycemia, edema including peripheral edema , anemia Elevated LFT’s (with elevated sirolimus levels) a, stomatitis, infections (including UTI, URI), mild thrombocytopenia , leukopenia , electrolyte disturbances (hyper/hypokalemia [L], hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia [L]), rash, hives, pruritus, delayed wound healing or dehiscence (L), proteinuria, TTP/HUS/TMA b especially with concurrent CNI Pleural and pericardial effusions, pulmonary toxicity (non-infectious pneumonitis, BOOP, pulmonary fibrosis), thrombosis, myalgias Delayed (any time later during therapy, excluding above conditions) Acne Kidney disease, CHF, ascites, arthrosis, bone necrosis, osteoporosis Late (any time after completion of treatment) Lymphoproliferati ve disorders, skin malignancies Unknown frequency and timing Embryo/fetotoxic; unknown whethe r excreted in human milk (L): Toxicity may also occur later. a Significant transaminitis, generally wit hout sequelae, may occur.

In allogeneic BMT, increase in TMA from 4.2% with tacrolimus or cyclosporine alone, versus 10.8% with tacrolimus/sirolimus combination was noted.66 c Lipid-lowering agent may be required; consider if fasting serum triglycerides are > 2.5 x ULN and recommend starting if > 800 mg/dL. Sirolimus is associated with a high risk for VOD after myeloablative conditioning, but this risk is lower in patients after RIC HCT, such as the regimen that will be utilized in this study. There is a still a possibility of VOD/SOS after RIC conditi oning, however as illustrated in a sub-group of patients treated by second RIC HCT after a first HCT 51. Drug interactions: Sirolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein. Ag ents that may increase sirolimus levels include tri-azole drugs (especially voriconazole and posaconazole*), amiodarone, calcium channel blockers, macrolide antibiotics (but not azithromycin), micafungin, gastroin testinal prokinetic agents (cisapride, metoclopramide), cimetidine, cycl osporine, grapefruit juice, and HIV protease inhibitors. Agents that may decrease sirolimus levels include anticonvulsants (carbamezep ine, phenobarbital, phenytoin), rifamycins, St. John’s Wort. Dose adjustments: The sirolimus dose is adjusted to maintain a serum trough level of 5 –15 ng/mL. Changes in levels due to altered bioava ilability should be apparent within 24-48 hours. For sirolimus without CNI as in this study, a 20-25% reduction of sirolimus dose is recommended for trough levels >15 – 18 ng/mL, and a 20-25% increa se is recommended for trough levels < 5 ng/mL. Renal failure does not affect the excretion of sirolimus. Excretion is reduced in liver failure; impaired hepatic function should prompt consideration of reduc tion in sirolimus maintenance doses, but no dose adjustment of the loading dose is necessary. Due to extreme interactions with voriconazole and posaconazole, these drugs are relatively contraindicated during sirolimus therapy. Siro limus dose is to be reduced by 90% when voriconazole is initiated and should also be significantly reduced with posaconazole. 2.5.7 Mycophenolate Mofetil (Cellcept®) Mycophenolate Mofetil is an ester prodrug of the active immunosuppressant mycophenolic acid (MPA). This active metabolite is a noncompetitive, reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). There are no pharmac okinetic interactions with ganciclovir, cotrimoxazole, oral contraceptives and cyclosporine. Side effect profiles include dia rrhea, leukopenia, sepsis, allergic reactions, and vomiting. There is also an increase in certain types of infection mainly from the herpes virus family (CMV, HSV & VZV) and Candida. 2.5.8 Rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) Thymoglobulin® [Anti-thymocyte Globulin (Rabb it)] is a purified, past eurized, gamma immune globulin, obtained by immunization of rabbits wi th human thymocytes. This immunosuppressive product contains cytotoxic an tibodies directed against an tigens expressed on human T- lymphocytes. This drug is commonly used to treat graft rejection in kidney transplantation. It is also commonly used in bone marrow transplantati on as part of the conditioning regimen to avoid"

Thymoglobulin is a sterile, freeze-dried product fo r intravenous administra tion after reconstitution with Sterile Water for Injection, USP (SWFI). Ea ch 10 mL vial contains 25 mg anti-thymocyte globulin (rabbit) as well as 50 mg glycine, 50 mg mannitol, and 10 mg sodium chloride. After reconstitution with 5 mL SWFI, each vial of reconstituted product cont ains approximately 5 mg/mL of Thymoglobulin, of which >90% is rabbit gamma immune globulin (IgG). The reconstituted solution has a pH of 7.0 ± 0.4. Huma n red blood cells are used in the manufacturing process to deplete cross-reactive antibodies to non-T-cell antigens. The manufacturing process is validated to remove or inactiv ate potential exogenous viruses. All human red blood cells are from US registered or FDA licensed blood banks. A vira l inactivation step (pasteurization, i.e., heat treatment of active ingredient at 60°C/10 hr) is pe rformed for each lot. Each Thymoglobulin lot is released following potency testing (lymphocytotoxicity and E-rosette inhibition assays), and cross- reactive antibody testing (hemagglutination, platel et agglutination, anti-human serum protein antibody, antiglomerular.) Adverse side effects include immunodeficiency, infusion related toxicities such as hypertension, chills, rigors, tachycardia, capillary leak syndrom e, hyperglycemia, cytopenias, transient hepatitis, anaphylaxis, serum sickness, myalgias, sensory changes including hearing loss, headaches, renal toxicity, dyspnea and bronchial spasm, fevers. The drug is potentially te ratogenic and is unknown if it can be passed to children in breastfeeding. rATG–rabbit must be infused through a 0.22 micro filter with premedication per institutional standard. If corticosteroids are use d, please discontinue prior to Day -1. Note: Keep anaphylaxis kit at beds ide during Thymoglobulin administration. 2.5.9 Hydroxyurea Administration can cause anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, nausea, vomiting, mouth sores, rash, painful and difficult urin ation, kidney damage, headache, di zziness, jaundice, hallucinations, seizures, diarrhea, temporarily increased levels of liver enzymes, darkening of the skin, and nail changes. 2.5.10 Corticosteroids Corticosteroids may not be used as an anti-emetic agent and should not be administered until 24 hours after the completion of pos t-transplantation cyclophosphamid e, unless used for adrenal support or during a medical emergency (e.g. treatm ent of anaphylaxis). Co rticosteroids may be used as a pre-medication during Thymoglobulin in fusion and discontinued i mmediately thereafter. 2.5.11 Total Body Irradiation Total body irradiation will be admin istered (200 cGy). This dose is a fraction of the irradiation delivered in typical myeloablative conditioning reg imens, thus modulated toxicity is anticipated. Nonetheless, irradiation can cause short-term and long-term toxicities, particul arly in children. The long-term toxicities include a risk of malignancy secondary to the exposure and a risk of infertility."

The testis is one of the most radiosensitive tissues, and even low doses of radiation can cause impairment of function. In adult men, dos es as low as 10 cGy can cause damage to spermatogonia 52. At single fraction doses of 200 to 300 cGy there is overt damage to spermatocytes in adult men and return to pre-irradiation sperm concentrations and germinal cell numbers ma y take up to 30 months 53. Fractionated doses are more toxic to spermatogenesis, and complete sterilization may occur if the fractionated dose exceeds 100 – 200 cGy. However, in the pre-pubertal state, the impact of radiotherapy is mitigated. In one study of 12 pre-pubertal boys who received 2400 cGy testicular irradiation to treat ALL, it was observed that testosterone levels were normal in all 12 and basal LH was normal in 9 and elevated in 354. Nonetheless, to preserve fertility and Leydig cell function in post- pubertal males, we propose to administer testicular shielding to all males during the single fraction of TBI. This shielding will have no impact on the immunosuppressive ef fect of the radiotherapy. x There will be no gonadal shielding in female patients. The effects of radiotherapy on ovarian function and fertility are dose- and age-dependent. However, ovarian doses of less than 400 cGy do not result in permanent ovarian dysfunction and the calculated LD50 of the human oocyte dose is approximately 400 cGy 55 56 57. Thus, ovarian shielding to preserve ovarian function will not be necessary for the dose of TBI administered in this investigation; moreover, shielding in this setting could reduce the immunosuppressive effects of TBI if intra-abdominal lymph nodes were inadvertently shielded."

EFS is defined as survival without a qualifying event. Primary gr aft rejection, secondary graft rejection, second infusion of hematopoietic cells or death will count as events for this endpoint. A secondary endpoint will asse ss EFS at 1 year post-transplant. 3.2 Secondary Endpoints All endpoints are stratum-specific. 3.2.1 Overall Survival Overall survival will be described post-enrollment and 1 and 2 years post-HaploBMT. Death from any cause will be the event and patients will be censored at the date of last contact or two years post-HaploBMT whichever comes first. Start time will either be the date of enrollment or HaploBMT for the two objectives. 3.2.2 Event Free Survival Event-free survival is defined as survival without a qualifying event. 3.2.3 Engraftment and Graft Rejection 3.2.3.1 Engraftment Engraftment is defined as having greater than or equal to 5% donor cells post-transplant, from any molecular chimerism assessment (e.g., unsorted, my eloid, or T-cell) on a peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate sample. 3.2.3.2 Primary Graft Failure Primary graft failure is defined as never achieving  5% donor whole blood or myeloid chimerism (myeloid is preferable) assessed by bone marrow or peripheral blood chimerism assays by day +42 post-transplant. Second infusion of stem cells is al so considered indicative of primary graft failure by day +42 post-transplant. 3.2.3.3 Secondary Graft Failure Secondary graft failure is defined as < 5% donor whole blood or myeloid chimerism (myeloid is preferable) in periphera l blood or bone marrow beyond day +42 post- transplant in patients with prior documenta tion of hematopoietic recovery with >5% donor cells by day +42 post-transp lant. Second infusion of stem cells is also considered indicative of secondary graft failure."

Pyrosequencing of lineage-specific mRNA directly measures functional reconstitution of donor cells and provides valuable info rmation that can affect clinical decisions in patients with nonmalignant diseases following allogeneic tr ansplant. Peripheral blood samples on post-transplant days 28, 42, 100 an d 180 days, 365 and 730 will be assayed into CD3+CD56- (T-lymphocytes) and CD15+, CD33+ or CD45+ (granulocytes) per institutional standard. Genomic DNA extracted from peripheral bl ood will be analyzed for variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) to detect donor engraftment in mononuclear cells and CD3+ lymphocytes. Percent donor chimerism will be anal yzed per institutional standard. 3.2.5 Transplant-related Complications 3.2.5.1 Grade II-IV and Grade III-IV Acute GVHD Incidence of grade II-IV and III-IV acute GVHD will be graded according to the NIH consensus criteria (refer to Appendix D). 3.2.5.2 Chronic GVHD Incidence and severity of chronic GVHD will be sc ored according to the NIH consensus criteria. (refer to Appendix E). 3.2.5.3 Neutrophil Recovery Time to neutrophil recovery is defined as the fi rst of 3 measurements on different days when the SDWLHQWKDVDQDEVROXWHQHXWU RSKLOFRXQWRIȝ/DIWHUFRQGL WLRQLQJ 3.2.5.4 Platelet Recovery Time to platelet recovery is defined as the firs t day of a minimum of 3 measurements on different days that WKHSDWLHQWKDVDFKLHYHGDSODWHOHWFRXQW!ȝ/$1'GLGQ RWUHFHLYHDSODWHOHW transfusion in the previous 7 days. The exception is the case in which a subject is given a platelet transfusion specifically to achieve a platelet threshold to allow an elective invasive procedure, such as a central catheter removal. 3.2.5.5 Veno-occlusive Disease Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) will be diagnosed and defined in accordance with either the modified Seattle or Baltimore criteria as outlined in Appendix J."

Dia gnosis via bronchoscopy is strongly encouraged. 3.2.5.7 CNS Toxicity CNS toxicity will be defined as seizures, CNS hemorrhage, or Posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PRES or RPLS). PRES is defined as an increased diffusion coefficient in areas of T2 hyperintensities on diffu sion-weighted imaging in the context of clinical symptoms or physical findings including headache, seizures, visual disturba nces, and altered level of consciousness. Please refer to Appendix I fo r additional details a nd recommended guidelines regarding PRES prophylax is and management 3.3 Infection Significant infections will be r ecorded including but not limited to bacterial or fungal sepsis, CMV reactivation with/without clinical disease, ade novirus infection, EBV PTLD, or other significant viral reactivations or community- acquired viral mold infections and invasive fungal infections. 3.4 Sickle Vasculopathy Evaluate if sickle vasculopathy is halted by successful transplantation as determined by comparing brain MRI pre- and 2 years post-haploBMT. Cerebral MRI is required for all pediatric patients to assess progression of CNS disease. For adults with where the indication for the transplant is a stroke, cerebral MRI is required after transpla nt to assess progression of CNS disease. 3.5 Disease Recurrence Disease recurrence is defined as the return of sickle erythr opoiesis (in the absence of RBC transfusion, Hb S level > 70%), or primary or secondary graft rejec tion, as defined above, or second infusion of hema topoietic cells. 3.6 Patient-reported HRQoL Outcomes including Pain and Fatigue Domains in the Adult Stratum Using Patient Reported Outcome Measurement In formation System (PROMIS) modules as the standardized assessment tool, patient reported outcomes in two specific quality of life domains, pain and fatigue, will be obtained from patients in the adult stratum at baseline (prior to the initiation of hydroxyurea), 1 year and 2 years post-transplant. Only E nglish- and Spanish-speaking adult stratum patients ar e eligible to participate in the HRQoL component of this trial. 3.7 Pain Intensity Change in pain intensity between the baseline (prior to the initiation of hydroxyurea), one-year, and two-year assessments fo r English-speaking patients  15.00 years of age at time of enrollment."
50,page_50,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 50 Based on estimates of daily pain in adults with SCD59, we anticipate that patients will report pain in pain diaries with a mean pa in intensity of 3.9 on a scale of 10 at baseline. We anticipate that adult patients will demonstrate a clinically significant decline in mean pain intensity to a level of 1.3 units on a scale of 10 two years later. While our endpoint is the change between the baseline and two-year assessments, we will also examine pain at one year, in order to better understand the trajectory of changes during the two year follow up period. 3.8 Disease-related Complications 3.8.1 Stroke An overt stroke is defined as a focal neurologic event and neurologi c deficit lasting more than 24 hours with neuroimaging changes. Patients with new MRI le sions and ongoing neurologic injury to the brain that does not result in focal motor imp airment are referred to as having silent cerebral infarcts. These lesions are defined as a MRI si gnal abnormality measuring at least 3 mm visible on two views on T-2 weighted images. Both forms of neurologic injury that develop as a new event post-transplant will be considered a disease related complication. 3.8.2 Occurrence of Sickle Related Events In addition to stroke as outlined above, participants will be follow ed for the entire 2 year duration of their time on study for the recurrence of SCD related complicati ons. These SCD related complications are henceforth referred to as SCD events of special interest (SCD-EOSI). For all participants, the following specific, SCD related events are expected events of special interest (SCD-EOSI): x pulmonary hypertension x significant cerebrovascul ar events, including: o stroke o transient ischemic attack o seizure x renal function compromise, including: o proteinuria o LQFUHDVHGFUHDWLQLQHJUDG HVSHU&7&$(YHUVLRQ 4.0 x avascular necrosis of the hip or shoulder x leg ulcers x acute chest syndrome (ACS ) requiring hospitalization x painful vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) requiring hospitalization or parenteral opioid drugs in the outpatient setting (s elf-reported events without clinical documentation should not be included) While these events do not require expedited reporting via completion of the Adverse Events forms, each occurrence of any SCD event of special interest (SCD-EOSI) must be reported on the SCD-"

A single event occurrence is defined as a new onset of any of the above listed SCD-EOSIs after screeni ng evaluations are completed. A single occurrence resolves once the SCD-EOSI retu rns to the participant’s baseline. Therefore, multiple occurrences of the same or several SCD-EOSIs may be reported in one reporting interval. The completion of the SCD-EOSI Form is require d and further detailed in the Data Management Handbook. 3.9 Lung function (PFTs) A growing body of evidence indicates the pulm onary toxicities associated with SCD are progressive in nature. A complete set of pulmonary function tests (PFTs) will be obtained at baseline (prior to the initiation of hydroxyurea), 1 year and 2 years post-tran splant. In addition to assessing changes in FEV1 at 1 and 2 years post BMT as compared with baseline, we will also assess the proportion of participan ts in whom evidence of restric tive lung disease is found. For the purposes of this protocol, restrictive lung diseas e is defined as TLC below the 5th percentile adjusted for age, gender, race and height. In the interest of good clinical practice, PFTs should be obtained more frequently if clini cally indicated, in the setting of cGVHD and/or in accordance with institutional standard of care mandates. A 6 minute walk test should accompany any significant decrease (>15% drop in predicted va lue of FEV1 or FEV1/FVC to determine if alternation in PFTs is associated with significant DOE). 3.10 TRJV (Cardiac Function) Tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity (TRJV) is a marker for th e severity and progression of SCD. Changes in TRJV from baseline (prior to the in itiation of hydroxyurea) to 1 year and 2 years post- transplant will be measured. 3.11 6-minute Walk Distance (6MWD) The 6MWD, a common assessment tool utilized in this disease population, will be administered at baseline (prior to the initiation of hydroxyurea), 1 year and 2 years pos t-transplant, w ith all testing to be administered under standardized procedures and in the same clini cal setting. This endpoint will measure absolute change from baseline, with increased distance identified as positive change. 3.12 Hematological Outcomes Hematological outcomes including Hgb, reticulocyt e count, %HbS, LDH, bilirubin, and last date of red blood cell transfusion will be measured pre-transplant a nd on post-transplant days 28, 100 and 180 days, 365 and 730. 3.13 Proportion of Participants Still on Immunosuppression 2 years after BMT Proportion of participants still receiving immunos uppressive therapy because of GVHD or concern about graft rejection will be determined."

The investigator or designee at the enrolling site will conduct a donor evaluation for prospective enrollees. If a su itable haploidentical donor is identified, written informed consent and assent for study enrollme nt review will be ob tained and eligibility determined. The participating center will register the participant using the BMT CTN Advantage Electronic Data Capture (AdvantageEDC) System. An authorized user at the center will complete the initial screening by entering patient demogr aphics, the Segment 0 registrati on (date of informed consent), and the HLA form. 4.1.1 Participant Entry and Registration If the participant is determined to be eligible for enrollment, an authorized user at the center will complete the Segment A enrollment form (inclusion/exclusion criteria). The Segment A form must be completed no more than 30 days prior to initiation of the hydroxyur ea conditioning regimen. The date of completion of the Segment A enroll ment form is the date of study enrollment. The Segment A enrollment successful screen must be obtained prior to initiating the protocol-specified dose of hydroxyurea. 4.1.2 Pain and Priapism Adjudication For only the pediatric stratum, the protocol chairs will review a completed questionnaire for potential participants referred for multiple pain episodes or multiple priapism episodes. In addition to the responses to the questionnaire, chil dren meeting either of the two criteria (pain or priapism) will be considered eligible; 1) acute severe vaso-occlusive pain episodes requiring hospitalization and recalcitrant to maximum medical therapy and 2) recurr ent priapism (episodes lasting at least 4 hours at least twice in the la st 12 months or 3 times in the last 24 months) recalcitrant to medical treatment or una ble to use hydroxyurea due to SCD phenotype. After the protocol chairs revi ew the questionnaire responses a nd the two eligibility criteria, participants will be designated as eligible, not eligible, or not evaluable based on the available information. 4.2 Participant Assessments 4.2.1 Follow-up Schedule The Follow-up Schedule for scheduled study vi sits is outlined in Table 4.2.1.

Federal Register Vol. 46, 17, January 27, 1981, part 56) and the Office for Protection from Research Risks Reports: Protection of Human Subjects (Code of Federal Regulations 45 CFR 46. 4.3.1 Reporting Participant Deaths Death information must be entered into AdvantageEDCSM within 24 hours of knowledge of the participant’s death. If the cause of death is unknown at that time, it need not be recorded at that time. However, once the cause of death is determined, the form must be updated in AdvantageEDCSM. In addition, death must be reported vi a the expedited repor ting requirements in AvantageEDCSM (see 4.2.3 below). 4.3.2 Adverse Event Reporting Adverse Event : An adverse event (AE) is any undesira ble sign, symptom or medical condition or experience that develops or wors ens in severity after starting th e first dose of study treatment or any procedure specified in the protocol, even if th e event is not considered to be related to the study. Expectedness : An adverse event can be Expected or Unexpected x Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered expected when it appears in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, or is included in the informed consent document as a potential risk. x Unexpected adverse events are those that vary in nature, intensity or frequency from information in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk. Serious Adverse Event: A serious adverse event (SAE), as defined by per 21 CFR 312.32, is any adverse event that results in one of the following outcomes, regardless of causality and expectedness: x Results in death. x Is life-threatening. Life-threatening means that the person was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form. x Requires or prolongs in patient hospitalization (i.e., the event required at least a 24- hour hospitalization or prolonged a hospitaliza tion beyond the expected length of stay). Hospitalization admissions and/or surgical ope rations scheduled to occur during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or disease existed before the person was enrolled in the tr ial, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., su rgery performed earlier than planned)."

Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct nor mal life functions. x Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect; or x Is an important medical event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it may jeopardize the participant and require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of su ch medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalizati on, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Medical and scientific judgment should be exerci sed in deciding whether expected reporting is also appropriate in situations ot her than those listed above. For ex ample, important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above (e.g., suspected transmission of an infectious agen t by a medicinal product is considered a Serious Adverse Event). Any event is considered a Serious A dverse Event if it is associated with clinical signs or symptoms judged by the investigator to have a significant clinical impact. 4.3.3 Required Adverse Event Reporting: Adverse event reporting will be consistent with BMT CTN procedures (BMT CTN Administrative Manual of Procedures, Chapter 6). It is BMT CTN policy that AEs must be reported even if the investigator is unsure whether a relationship exists between the a dverse event and the use of study treatment. Unexpected serious adverse events w ill be reported through the expedited AE reporting system in AdvantageEDC. Unexpected, Grade 4- 5 SAEs must be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. All other unexpected SAEs must be reported with in three business days of knowledge of the event. Events entered in AdvantageEDC will be reported using NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0. Expected AEs will be reported using NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 at regular intervals as defined on the Form Submi ssion Schedule (e.g. Re-Adm ission/Hospitalization, Infection, GVHD, and Toxicity Forms). Any exp ected life-threatening SAE not collected on another study form must be reported throug h the expedited AE reporting system via AdvantageEDC. The NHLBI Data and Safety Monitoring Board will receive summary re ports of all adverse experiences at least twice yearly. In addition to the standard BMT CTN SAE repor ting, all deaths, central nervous system (CNS) events, diagnosis of posterior reversible encep halopathy syndrome (PRES) /reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPL S), and/or events requiring advanced care interventions or admission/transfer to an intensive care unit (ICU) are required to be reported via the expedited AE reporting system in AdvantageEDC for this study.

EFS is defined as survival without a qualifying even t (see Section 3.1). This is a single arm study in which participants will be enrolled into one of two strata. The first stratum will be restricted to children who have stroke and 40 ch ildren will be transplanted in th is stratum. The second stratum will consist of adult patients with severe sickle cell disease and 40 participants will be transplanted in this stratum. Safety monitoring will occur on a monthly basis for several safety endpoints. If the safety criterion for graft rejection is met in eith er stratum, and if the DSMB and sponsor agree that accrual to a stratum should stop, then accrual to that stratum will be halted. For that stratum, participants already accrued will continue to be followed pe r protocol. Further, wi th DSMB and sponsor approval, an additional 40 participants will be transplanted in the strata but will use a different conditioning regimen. Safety monitoring for all safe ty endpoints will be reset for the stratum that changes conditioning regimen (see S ection 5.3 for further details). All analyses are within-stratum, and each stratu m will follow it is own timeline of completion for the primary analysis for the stratum If a new conditioning regimen is implemented for any strata, then for that stratum, descriptive statistics or listings will be provided using data from participants enrolled under the original dose of TBI; the st ratum-specific analyses will be limited to the participants enrolled under the new conditioning regimen. 5.1.1 Accrual It is estimated that it will require four years to complete the accrual with 10 patients transplanted in each stratum per year. If accrual to any arm is restarted based on the planned change in conditioning regimen, then it is estimated accrual in that strata will take four years from the time when the change in conditi oning regimen is implemented. 5.1.2 Study Duration Participants will be followed fo r the 28-day baseline pain diar y period, 70 day conditioning period and for two years post-transplant fo r primary and secondary endpoints. 5.1.3 Randomization and Blinding This is a single arm trial with no randomization and no blinding."
71,page_71,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 71 5.1.4 Primary Endpoint The primary objective of this clinical trial is to estimate two-year post-transplant event-free survival in each age stratum. EFS is defined as survival without a qualifying event. Events contributing to this endpoint are as below: i. Primary graft rejection 3ULPDU\JUDIWIDLOXUHLVGHILQHGDVQHYHUDFKLHYLQJGRQRU  whole blood or myeloid chimerism (myeloid is preferable) assessed by bone marrow or peripheral blood chimerism assays by da y +42 post-transplant. Second infusion of stem cells is also considered indicativ e of primary graft failure by day +42 post- transplant). ii. Secondary graft rejection (S econdary graft failure is de fined as < 5% donor whole blood or myeloid chimerism (myeloid is preferable) in peripheral blood or bone marrow beyond day +42 post-transplant in patients with prior documentation of hematopoietic recovery with >5% donor ce lls by day +42 post- transplant. Second infusion of stem cells is also considered indicative of secondary graft failure). iii. Second infusion of hematopoietic cells (Infusion of a sec ond stem cell product will be considered graft rejection, and counted toward primary or, depending on timing of the second infusion, secondary graft rejection). iv. Death (from any cause by 2 years post-transplant) The EFS probability estimates w ill be based on the Kaplan-M eier product limit estimator using Greenwood’s formula as the variance estimate. Fo r the primary analysis, time to event will be calculated as the minimum of the time from study star t of HU conditioning to the first event, loss to follow-up, or two years post- transplant. Reas ons for not getting a transplant or not starting conditioning will be described. A secondary endpoint will assess EF S at 1 year post-transplant. Further analyses include EFS from time of transplant and will restrict analyses to those receiving a transplant. 5.2 Sample Size Considerations The sample size is 40 transplanted participants per each of the two stratum in this trial. Ninety- five percent confidence intervals were calculated for varying probabilities based on the sample size. The primary endpoint, event-free survival (EFS), is considered for sample size determination. Table 5.2 provides confidence intervals for a vari ety of observed proportions based on the binomial proportion. Of particular intere st is where the EFS probability is 80%. If the observed EFS probability is 80%, the width of the confidence interval is 24.8. The tabu lated percentages and confidence intervals for observed probabilities above and below 80% are meant to represent other plausible EFS percentages."

In the absence of censoring, the Kaplan-Meier estimate reduces to the simple binomial proportion. If the linear confidence intervals extend beyond 0 or 100, log-log confiden ce intervals may be used. It is estimated that there may be more than 40 participants enrolled to reach 40 transplanted participants. For example, there may be 53 pa rticipants enrolled with 15% censored.

Monitoring of key safety endpoints will be c onducted monthly, and if rates significantly exceed pre-set thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in order that the DSMB can be advised. Policies and compositi on of the DSMB are described in the BMT CTN's Manual of Procedures. The stopping guidelines serve as a trigger for consultation with the DSMB for additional review."
73,page_73,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 73 The key safety endpoint of 100-da y graft failure will be monito red, with a planned protocol modification of the conditioning regimen plan ned if rates exceed 15% in the first 12 evaluable participants in a stratum. After th e first 12 evaluable participants, if the stopping boundary has not been crossed, then the graft failu re rate will continue to be monitored as a safety guideline for consultation with the DS MB but it is unlikely the conditioning regimen will change and accrual be restarted. Within each stratum, the additiona l key safety endpoints to be m onitored are the following rates: x Acute, grade III-IV GVHD by 100 days post-transplant x Overall mortality by 180 days post initiation of hydroxyurea x Severe chronic GVHD by 18 months post-transplant A truncated version of the sequential probability ra tio test (SPRT) will be used for monitoring, as described in greater detail belo w and in Appendix H. This sequent ial testing proc edure conserves type I error across all of the pl anned examinations for a treatme nt arm for a given stopping rule and stratum. Two versions of the SPRT will be used. For graft failure, a binomial SPRT will be used, and a plot will display the number of evaluable patients versus the number of observed events. Other safety endpoints will be monito red using an extension to the SPRT for censored exponential data. This ex tension will plot the observed time on study versus the number of observed events (see Appendix H). The continua tion region for both versions of the SPRT is defined by two parallel lines. Only the upper bounda ry will be used for monitoring to protect against excessive rates. If the graph cro sses the upper boundary, the SPRT rejects the null hypothesis, and concludes that there are more ev ents than predicted. Otherwise, the SPRT continues until the monitoring period is complete. The usual measures of performance of an SPRT are the error probabilities D and E of rejecting H 0 when T = T0 and of accepting H 1 when T = T1, respectively, and the expected sample size E(N| Ti). 5.3.1 Monitoring Guideline: 100-day Graft Failure Rate within a Stratum The monitoring of graft failure is a key safety endpoint for which a prot ocol modification for a change in the dose level of TBI is pre-planned in the event the boundary is crossed within the first 12 evaluable participants. This monitoring procedure assumes a binary distri bution for graft failure during the first 100 days post-transplant. If the participant has been tran splanted but has had prima ry or secondary graft rejection by day 100, the participan t is assumed to be a graft fa ilure at day 100. Chimerism from samples collected within the D100 visit window will be used for evaluation of graft failure at Day 100. This monitoring guideline uses an SPRT cont rasting a null hypothesis of 15% versus an alternative of 35% 100-day graft failure which results in decision boundaries with a common slope of 0.240 and an upper intercept of 2.59, with nominal type I and type II errors of 5% and 10%, respectively. Table 5.3.1 summarizes the stopping rule."

If a decision is made to stop accrual under the initial conditioning regimen, then sites will be notified to st op accrual in that stratum. If the DSMB and sponsor choose to implement the modified conditioning regimen, accrual will be restarted using the modified conditioning regimen (TBI 400 cGy) . An additional 40 patients wi ll be enrolled with the new conditioning regimen and the first 12 patients receiving the modified regimen will be monitored for incidence of 100-day graft failure . Safety monitoring for all endpoi nts for participants in that stratum will be restarted. If the safety boundary has not been triggered in the first 12 evaluable participants in each stratum and the DSMB recommends continuing accrual, then safety monitoring for 100-day graft failure will continue using the SPRT. A lternatively, if the stopping boundary is crossed after the first 12 evaluable participants, then DSMB will be consulted but it is anticipated the recommendation will be to terminate accrual in that stratum and not restart with the new regimen, given the logistical difficulty of completing enrollment of an additional 40 participants in a timely manner. 5.3.3 Monitoring Guideline: Grade III-IV Acute GV HD by Day 100 Post Transplant within a Stratum The incidence of acute grade III-IV GVHD is a pproximately 15-17% after HLA-identical sibling BMT. 62, 63, 64, 65 Each month, the null hypothesis that the 100-day acute GVHD rate is 20% is tested.

STUDY BACKGROUND The National Institutes of Health (NIH), through the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN), are providing staff support and money for this research study. The BMT CTN and the NIH w ill make decisions a bout how to manage the study. SEVERE SICKLE CELL DISEASE AND ALLOGENEIC TRANSPLANT Severe Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a blood disorder you’re born with. Red blood cells carry oxygen to different parts of your body. SCD is caused by a change in hemoglobin , the protein that helps red blood cells carry oxygen in the bod y. The change blocks the blood flow in small vessels which can cause severe (serious) pain. It can also damage your lungs, brain, kidneys, and other organs. A person with SCD lives about 30 years shorter than a person without SCD. An allogeneic transplant , or bone marrow transplant, uses healthy blood-making cells from a donor to replace unhealthy ones. It requi res donors and patients to have matched human leukocyte antigens (HLA) . HLA is a protein marker found on most cells in your body. HLA markers are inherited (given to you from your mo ther or father). You get half of your HLA markers from your mother and half from your father . A haploidentical transplant is an allogeneic transplant wher e the donor matches exactly half of your HLA. Parents are always a half-match for their biological children and children are always a half-match for their biological pa rents. Biological siblings (broth ers or sisters) have a 50% (1 out of 2) chance of being a half-match for each other. In this study, we want to learn if a haploidentical transplant is effective and safe to treat SCD. This study will use a parent or other half-mat ched family member donor . This treatment may stop the disease and many of its health problems. But there is also a chance that it may not work, and the disease can come back. ALLOGENEIC TRANSPLANT – REDUCED INTENSITY TRANSPLANT There are 2 main steps with allogeneic tran splant. First, to prepare your body, we use chemotherapy and radiation to destroy the a bnormal blood cells. This step is called the conditioning regimen . Then, when the conditioning reg imen is done, you’re given the donor cells for your transplant. In this study, your doctor will use lower doses of chemotherapy and radiatio n than are normally used for allogeneic tran splant. This is called a reduced intensity transplant ."

STUDY PURPOSE We’re doing this study to learn if a haploidentical transplant is safe and effective to treat SCD. A haploidentical transplant uses a half or pa rtially matched donor . (“Haplo” means half.) This study will use a parent or other family member who is a half tissue match. You’re being asked to join this study because you:  Are between 5 – 14 years old and ha d one or more of the following: o Prior or silent stroke • Overt stroke –a permanent injury to the brain associated with physical manifestations that is associated with future overt strokes or silent strokes • Silent stroke –a permanent injury to the brain associated with decreased thinking abilities that might be as severe as an overt stroke and is associated with future silent stroke or overt strokes. o Serious pain episodes requiring hospita lization not fully managed by medical therapy. o One episode of life-threatening acute ches t syndrome episode resulting in intensive care admission. o Increased blood pressure in the arteries of your lungs (pulmonary hypertension) or in the rest of your body (systemic hypertensi on) that can make it difficult to breathe. o Recurrent priapism (prolonged penile erec tion for at least 4 hours) occurring twice in 12 months or 3 times in 24 months while on hydroxyurea if indicated.  Are between 15 – 45 years old and had 1 or more of the following: o Stroke o 2 or more episodes of acute chest syndrome in the last 2 years while getting other treatment such as hydroxyurea o 3 or more episodes of serious pain crises in the last 2 years while getting other treatment such as hydroxyurea o Regular red blood cell (RBC) transfusions (8 or more transfusion events during the last year to prevent sickle-related health problems) o Fast blood flow in your heart and in the wrong direction. This may mean you may have a higher risk of dying.  Have a donor (parent, brother, sister , or other family member) who is a half match You can’t be in this st udy if you have one or more of the following: o A brother or sister who closely ma tches more than half of your HLA o Liver cirrhosis (damage to the liver which can lead to scarring and liver failure) o A very serious bacterial, fungal, or viral infection in the past 6 weeks"

RIGHT TO ASK QUESTIONS AND/OR WITHDRAW You have the right to ask questions about the study at any time. If you ha ve questions about your rights as a participant or you want to leave the study, please contact: [Insert contact info] Being in this study is voluntary. You can choose to not be in this study or leave this study at any time. If you choose not to take part or to leave this st udy, it will not affect your re gular medical care in any way. Your study doctor and study staff w ill be available to answer any questions that you may have about taking part or leaving this study. 5. STUDY TREATMENTS AND TESTS If you join this study, we’ll check your health before, during, and for 2 years after your treatment. A. BEFORE YOUR TREATMENT You’ll have several check-ups and tests before your transplant. Some of these tests are given to all patients who get a transplant. Others are for this study only. Some of the tests will be done up to 6 months before you enroll and some of the tests will be done later, about a month before enrolling on the study and then again before starting the drug called hydroxyurea, or befo re starting the drug called ATG (Thymoglobulin).

B. DURING YOUR TREATMENT Getting Your Catheter: A surgeon will place a central venous catheter in your body, most likely in your chest. A catheter is a thin, hollow tube that allows me dicines, blood transfusions, and blood draws to be done painlessly and to avoid repeated needle sticks. It ’s also called the “central line”. The catheter will need to be cleaned every da y to avoid blood clots and infection. You and your caregiver will be given instructions on how to take care of the catheter. The surgeon will talk with you before the su rgery about the risks related to having a catheter. Preparing for Transplant: To prepare your body for transplant, we use ch emotherapy and radiati on to destroy or stop the abnormal blood cells from be ing made. This step is ca lled the “conditioning regimen”. The chemotherapy (chemo) drugs also help the donor cells engraft. “Engraft” means that the cells start to grow and make new cells and show up in your blood. See Table 1: Schedule of Treatments Before and After Transplant for a list of the chemo drugs you’ll get and how often you’ll take them. The chemo drugs and radiation before transplant include: 1. Hydroxyurea: This treatment w ill start in the hospital (or clinic) and continue at home. 2. Rabbit anti-thymoglobulin (rATG) 3. Thiotepa 4. Fludarabine 5. Cyclophosphamide 6. Total body irradiation (TBI): A single dose will be given while you are put in front of a machine. Transplant Day: On transplant day (Day 0), you’ll ge t your donor cells through your catheter. Your blood pressure, heart and respira tion rates, and temperature will be"

The study doctor may also give you medicines be fore the transplant to help with any side effects or discomfort. Some of thes e side effects and discomforts include:  Complications with catheter like blood clots and infection  Slow recovery of blood counts  New stem cells aren’t growing at all (graft failure) which means you continue to have your disease  Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD) (described below)  Damage to the vital organs in your body  Serious infections  Disease comes back (this happens when your body rejects the new stem cells)  Death  Reproductive risks (ability to have or father children after the transplant) See Section 6: Risks and Disc omforts for more information. C. AFTER YOUR TRANSPLANT Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) Prevention Drugs: Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) happens when the donor cells see your body as foreign (or different) and attack it. It can be a very serious side effect of transplant. We’ll give you 3 drugs to help prev ent GVHD after your transplant. See Table 1: Schedule of Treatments Before and After Transplant for a list of the GVHD prevention drugs you’ll get and how often you’ll take them: 1. Cyclophosphamide: You’ll get cyclophos phamide to prevent GVHD and also to help the donor cells engraft. “E ngraft” means that the cells start to grow and make new cells and show up in your blood. 2. MESNA: Because there is a risk of irritation and damage to the bladder, MESNA will be given before and afte r cyclophosphamide to help protect the bladder. 3. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): Your doctor may keep giving MMF to you after 35 days, if you have GVHD. 4. Sirolimus: The study doctor may cha nge the dose based on how your body reacts to the drug. Also, your doctor ma y keep giving it to you after 1 year, if you have GVHD."

Your health care team may give you medicines to help with certain side effects like nausea (feeling sick to your stomach). In some cases, side ef fects can last a long time or may never go away. A. RISKS OF MEDICINES Table 3: Risks and Side Effects shows how side effects are grouped together. The 3 groups are based on how often patients get each side effect. TABLE 3: RISKS AND SIDE EFFECTS Likely What it means: This type of side ef fect is expected in more than 20% of patients. This means that 21 or more patients out of 100 might get this side effect. Less Likely What it means: This type of side ef fect is expected in 20% of patients or fewer. This means that 20 patie nts or fewer out of 100 might get this side effect. Rare, but Serious What it means: This type of side ef fect is expected in fewer than 2% of patients. This means that 1 or 2 patients (or fewer) out of 100 might get this side effect.

These risk s may happen with all allogeneic transplants, whether they are part of a study or not. The risks include: Complications with Ce ntral Venous Catheter: The most common problems with central venous cathe ters are: 1) blood clots in the catheter and 2) infection. Your doctor w ill inject medicines into the catheter to dissolve a clot or treat an infection. If the medicines don’t work, the catheter might be replaced with a new one."
107,page_107,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 107 Slow Recovery of Blood Counts: The red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets can be slow to recover after a transplant. Until your blood counts recover, you’ll be at risk for bleeding and infection, and you’ll need blood and platelet transfusions. Graft Failure: We’ll check your blood often to see how well the stem cells (the “graft”) are growing inside your body. If the graft isn’t growing well or at all (graft failure), we’ll give you medicines to help the stem cells grow. You may also need a second transplant. Past experience suggests that there can be a 10 - 15% chance of graft failure. If your graft fails, you’ll stop being in this study and receive the standard care for SCD. Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD): GVHD happens when the donor cells see your body as foreign and attack it. In most cases, GVHD can be successfully treate d. Sometimes GVHD is serious or difficult to treat and may lead to death. You’ll be watched closely for GVHD and given drugs to help prevent and treat it. Acute GVHD, which can happen 0 – 3 months afte r transplant, may cause skin rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, problems with your liver, and an increased risk of infection. Chronic GVHD, which can happen 3 months or late r after transplant, may produce skin rashes, hair loss, thickened dry skin, dr y eyes, dry mouth, liver disease, weight loss, diarrhea, and an increased risk of infection. To confirm the diagnosis of acute or chroni c GVHD, your doctor may do a biopsy of your skin, gut, or liver. A biopsy is a small sample of your tissue to look at under the microscope. Damage to the Vital Or gans in Your Body: The transplant may cause problems with your organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, gut, kidneys, bladder, or brain. The kidneys and liv er are most likely to be damaged. Some patients will experience se rious lung problems from an infection, from chronic GVHD or from the chemotherapy and radiation. Serious Infections: Full and complete recovery of your immune syst em may take several m onths. During this time, there is an increased risk of infection. We’ll gi ve you drugs to reduce the chance of infection, but these treatments don’t always work. If you get an in fection, you may have to stay in the hospital longer or be re-hospitalized. Mo st infections can be treated, but some result in death."
108,page_108,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 108 Recurrence of Disease and Graft Rejection: There is a risk that the new marrow will fail to “take” and won’t grow after your transplant. This is called graft rejection . If this happens, your own marrow will recover, and sickle cell disease will come back. Pain crises or other complications might also return. Very rarely, other complications from graft rejec tion can happen including serious infection and the need for a blood transfusion. Damage to Central Nervous System (CNS): The transplant may affect your central nervous system (CNS). Your CNS includes your brain and spine. We’ll watch you closely after your tran splant for any side effects to your brain or spine. Risk of Death: Side effects of an allogeneic tr ansplant can be very serious and possibly lead to death. Death can occur either as a result of the medications you receive to prepare your body for transplant or from a complication of transplant. We’ll do everything we can to make the transplant as safe as possible for you. Reproductive Risks: The drugs used in this research study may dama ge your reproductive organs and affect your ability to have children. We don’t know the exact risk of sterility (inability to have children) caused by taking the study drugs. You should talk to a specialist about your opti ons for fertility preservation. Your options may include storing your sperm or eggs, or tissue from your ovary or testes. We’ll refer you to a fertility preservation center before your transplant. The treatments in this study have not been proven to be safe at any stag e of pregnancy, including when the sperm enters the egg (conception).  If you’re female : o Your menstrual cycle might become irregular or perm anently stop if you’ve gone through puberty. o You must use 2 effective methods of birth control if you’re sexually active (having sexual intercourse with a male partner) during your transplant.

Some of the questions or topics may upset you. You may feel emotional or that yo ur privacy is lost. Talk to your doctor about your privacy concerns. We can put you in touch with a counselor or trained support specialist, if needed. Risks of Blood Draws: There are no major risks with blood draws. Havi ng your blood drawn can be uncomfortable and may cause a bruise. In rare cases, a blood draw can cause fainting. Only trained people will draw your blood. Unforeseen Risks: Other new risks might appear at any time duri ng the study. These risks might be different from what is listed in this Consent Form. There may be some unknown or unanticipated discomforts or risks associated with this treatment in addition to those specified above, but every precaution will be taken to assure your personal sa fety and to minimize discomforts. Other Treatments or Medicines: Some medicines react with each ot her, so it’s important to tell the study doctor or staff about any other drugs, treatments, or medi cines you’re taking. This incl udes non-prescription or over-the- counter medicines, vitamins , and herbal treatments. It’s also important that you tell the study staff about any changes to your medicines while you’re in the study. For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor. 7. OTHER TREATMENTS It’s optional to join this study. If you choose not to join, you may still r eceive an allogeneic transplant to treat your disease.

Why am I here? We are inviting you to join our study because you have severe Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) or because you’ve had a stroke fr om the disease. You are now getting blood transfusions, hydroxyurea or othe r medicines. There is anothe r treatment for sickle cell disease called bone marrow transplant (BMT). SCD is a blood disease. In SCD, the red bl ood cells, which are normally shaped like a donut, become sickle shaped. When this happens, they can get stuck in your blood vessels. This can cause pain and damage in different body parts. BMT uses blood making cells from another pe rson to replace your cells that are not healthy. Donor is the name for a person who gi ves some of their cells for a transplant. In order for them to give you their cells, their DNA has to match yours. B. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS STUDY? We know that a transplant can cure SCD but we don’t know if it works when the donor is not a perfect match. We are doing this study to see if a transplant with a donor who is related to you, but is not a perfect matc h, is safe and if it makes you better. C. WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME? If you say you want to be in the study, we will ask you to:  Have check-ups with the study doctors  Give some blood (about 3 teaspoons) Reduced Intensity Conditioning for Haploidentical Bone Marrow Transplantation in Patients with Symptomatic Sickle Cell Disease"
121,page_121,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 121  If you agree, we will collect extra blood (a bout 4 teaspoons) at 5 different times. Your blood samples will be used for resear ch about transplant in patients with sickle cell disease. Your samples will be sent to a lab for an important study. All research samples will be tied to a number and resear chers testing your samples will not be able to identify you. We will watch you carefully for fevers, any sign of infection or other problems. The study will be done over 2 years. Before your transplant, you will get a small bendable tube put in your chest in the operating room (you will be asleep for this). Th e small tube makes it easier for you to get your medicines. It will also make it easier for drawing blood for tests because you will not be poked. We will give you medicines that will help make the cells from your donor grow in your body. These medicines might make you feel sic k. You might throw up, lose your hair, or get sores in your mouth. You will get cells from your donor. This is your transplant. Your new cells will come from your donor's bone marrow. The cells may make new and healthy cells in your body. Because your donor is not a perfect match, you w ill also get medicines after the transplant to stop the donor cells from attacking your body. This is a problem called graft-versus- host disease (GVHD). GVHD happens when the donor cells attack your body. It can give you diarrhea, a skin rash, make you feel sick and throw up, or make you not feel hungry. Your doctors will give you medicines to try to make sure you don’t get GVHD. You will stay in the hospital fo r several days before your tran splant and for about 4 weeks after your transplant. After you go home, you will need to go back to see your doctor often. It is possible that your disease will come back. If this happens, your doctor will find another way to treat you. D. WILL IT HURT? For your transplant, we will put a small tube in your chest. It might hurt a little and you might bleed a little. Your doctor and nurses wi ll make sure you feel as little pain as possible. If you get mouth sores or if you get gr aft-versus-host disease, this can also hurt, but your doctor will give medici ne to help with the pain. These problems usually will get better after a while."

It w ill hurt for a minute and sometimes the place where the needle went might be red and sore. You might get a little bruise from the needle, but it goes away in a few days. The medicines you get might also make you si ck. You might feel sick to your stomach or throw up. You might feel tired and you r body might hurt. But your doctor will give you other medicine to help you feel better. Also, you might lose your hair. But it will grow back after you are done taking the medicines. E. WILL THE STUDY HELP ME? We don’t know if the study will help you or not. What we learn from it might help other people in the future. F. WHAT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS? You can ask any questions that you have about the study. If you forget to ask a question and think of it later, you can call me [ins ert office number]. You can also ask your question the next time you see me. You can call the study office at any time to ask questions about the study. G. DO I HAVE TO BE IN THIS STUDY? If you don’t want to be in the study, you need to tell us and your pa rent or guardian.

There might be other studies for sickle cell dis ease you can join, or a different kind of transplant You can say yes now and change your mind at any time. Your docto r will not be angry if you change your mind. Please talk this over with your parent or guar dian before you decide if you want to be in the study.

138,page_138,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 138 IMMUNE RECONSTITUTION ANCILLARY STUDY PROCEDURES Study patients and associated haploidentical bone marro w donors will be provided the opportunity to participate in an optional corr elative laboratory study associated with the BMT CTN 1507 trial. The overall objective of th e protocol-defined co rrelative laboratory study is to examine in greater detail how the immune system recovers in SCD patients that have received a haploidentical donor bone marrow transplant. 1.Background: Recent data presented at the 2016 BMT Tandem Meeting showed that in 8 sickle cell patients receiving ex-vivo T-cell deplete transplant that sustained engraftment was seenand the average Day +30 donor NK chimerism was 90% 68. Early predominant donor NK chimerism may thus be an impor tant part of engraf tment and may serve as an early marker of success. However, the role of NK ce ll chimerism in a post-transplant cyclophosphamide based T-cell depletion approach for sickle cel l disease, as proposed for the BMT CTN 1507 trial, is unknown; this correla tive laboratory study hopes to a ddress this gap in knowledge. As T cell depletion in an important part of GVHD prevention in a mismatched setting such as haploidentical transplantation it is important to confirm that viral T cell immunity is not negatively impacted. Performing T cell depletion of donor lymphocytes ex-vivo often leads to delayed viral-specific immunity (up to one year) leaving the patient susceptible to life threating viral infection. CMV, EBV and Ad enovirus infections/r eactivations are particularly problematic , with adenovirus alone affecting > 80% of pediatric patients after T cell depleted haploidentical transplant and is associated with significant morbidity and a high mortality rate if the patient develops viral disease69. However, in a previously published study from the Johns Hopkins group afte r haploidentical transplant for sickle cell disease, 3 of 14 (21%) of patients ha d CMV reactivation but no patient developed CMV disease, and one of these patients had EBV reactivation treated effectively with a single dose Rituximab 70. In the preliminary experience of reduced intensity haploidentical transplantation for SCD for the BMT CTN 1507 tr ial, 7 of 12 patients had viral reactivation (CMV, EBV, VZV, HHV6) but no disease. We hypothesize that with a post-transplant cyclophosphamide approach that viral-specific T cells transferred with the allograft remain relatively intact given that alloreactive T cells rather than viral-specific T cells are most active at the day +3 and +4 time-points of cyclophosphamide infu sion and are preferentially depleted and accounts for the absence of viral disease. We plan to test this hypothesis by evaluating patients post-transplant for the presence of vi ral-specific T cells in their peripheral blood. 2.Immune Reconstitution Study Aims : a.To determine if predominantly donor Da y 28, NK cell chimerism (>90%) is more predictive of sustained engraftment than Day 28 T cell chimerism following haploidentical donor BMT for sickle cell disease"

147,page_147,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 147 The Working Group recommends that the diagnosis of chronic GVHD require at least 1 diagnostic manifestation of chronic GVHD or at least 1 distinctive manifestatio n, with the diagnosis confirmed by pertinent biopsy, labor atory tests, or radiology in the same or another organ. As in acute GVHD, infection and other causes may conf ound or complicate the differential diagnosis of chronic GVHD (e.g., nail dystrophies associated with onychomycosis, herpes simplex, or Candida albicans infections of the oral cavity; drug toxi city) and must be excluded. Diagnostic and distinctive manifestations of ch ronic GVHD can be found in the skin and appendages, mouth, eyes, female genitalia, esophagus , lungs, and connective tissues. Biops y or other testing is always encouraged and often valuable to confirm the pr esence of chronic GVHD, but it is not always feasible and is not mandatory if the patient has at least 1 of the diagnostic findings of chronic GVHD (Table 1). Please note that an in-dep th discussion of recommended terminology for histopathologic interpretation may be found in a forthcoming histopathology working group report. A biopsy read as “consistent with” or “unequivocal” chronic GVHD will be considered sufficient to establish the diagnosis of chr onic GVHD if accompanied by at least 1 distinctive clinical manifestation. Characteristics that establish the diagnosis of chronic GVHD might not serve as the most appropriate parameters for assessing the severity of chroni c GVHD. Valid and reliable diagnostic criteria might not be sufficiently sensitive to chan ge to be useful as treatment- response criteria. Conversely, a sensitive measure of chronic GVHD response might not necessarily serve as an appropriate diagnostic and scoring tool. A. Organ-specific manifestations of chronic GVHD In all cases, drug reaction, infection, recurrent or new malignancy, and other causes must be excluded. Diagnostic clinical or laboratory features sufficient fo r the diagnosis of chronic GVHD are italicized in the sections below. B. Skin Diagnostic manifest ations include poikiloderma (e.g., atrophic and pigmentary changes), lichen planus-like eruption (e.g., erythematous/violaceous flat-topped papules or plaques with or without surface reticulations or a silvery or shiny appearance on direct light), deep sclerotic features (e.g., smooth, waxy, indurated skin—“thicke ned or tight skin,” caused by d eep and diffuse sclerosis over a wide area), morphea-like superficial sclerotic features (e.g., localized patchy areas of moveable smooth or shiny skin with a leathery-like consistency, often with dyspigmentation), or lichen sclerosus-like lesions (e.g., discrete to coalescent gray to wh ite moveable papules or plaques, often with follicular plugs, with a shiny appearance and leathery consistency). Severe sclerotic features characterized by thickened, tight, and fragile skin are often associated with poor wound healing, inadequate lymphatic dr ainage, and skin ulcers from minor trauma. A distinctive feature for chronic GVHD (not seen in acute GVHD, but not sufficiently unique to be considered diagnostic of chronic GVHD) is depigmentation. However, depigmentation would contribute to the diagnosis of ch ronic GVHD in combination with"

Sweat impairment and intolerance to temperature change from loss of sweat glands are seen in chronic GVHD. Other common, nondistinctive skin manifestations f ound with both acute and chronic GVHD include erythema, maculopapular rash, and pruritus. C. Nails Dystrophy consisting of longitudinal ridging, nail splitting or brittleness, o nycholysis, pterygium unguis, and nail loss (usually symme tric and affecting most nails) ar e distinctive signs of chronic GVHD but are not sufficient for diagnosis. D. Hair Distinctive features of chroni c GVHD include new scarring and nonscarring scalp alopecia (after recovery from chemotherapy or radiotherapy) an d loss of body hair. Other characteristics seen with chronic GVHD include premature graying, th inning, or brittleness, but these findings are not diagnostic. E. Mouth Diagnostic features of or al chronic GVHD include lichen planus-like changes (white lines and lacy-appearing lesions of the buccal mucosa, tongue, pa late, or lips), hyperkeratotic plaques (leukoplakia), or decreased oral range of motion in patient s with sclerotic features of skin GVHD . Distinctive features of chroni c GVHD include xerostomia (dr yness), mucoceles, mucosal atrophy, pseudomembranes, and ulcers (infec tious pathogens such as yeast or herpesvirus; secondary malignancy must be excluded). Manifestations common to both acute and chronic GVHD include gingivitis, mucositis, erythema, and pain. F. Eyes Distinctive manifestations of chronic GVHD include new onset of dry, gritty, or painful eyes; cicatricial conjunctivitis; keratoc onjunctivitis sicca; and confluent areas of punctate keratopathy. Other features include photophobia, periorbital h yperpigmentation, difficulty in opening the eyes in the morning because of mucoid secretions, and blepharitis (erythema of the eye lids with edema). 1HZRFXODUVLFFDGRFXPHQWHGE\OR Z6FKLUPHUWHVWYDOXHVZLWKD PHDQYDOXHRIERWKH\HVPP at 5 minutes or a new onset of keratoconjunctivitis sicca by slit-lamp examination with mean values of 6 to 10 mm on the Schirmer test is sufficien t for the diagnosis of chronic GVHD if accompanied by distinctive manifestations in at least 1 other organ.

149,page_149,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 149 H. Gastrointestinal Tract Diagnostic features for the gast rointestinal (GI) tract include esophageal web , stricture , or concentric rings documented by endoscopy or barium cont rast radiograph. Chronic GVHD may be associated with pancreatic exocrine insu fficiency, which often improves with enzyme supplementation. Manifestations common to bot h acute and chronic GVHD (as well as other causes, such as drug side effects, motility disorders, infections, or malabsorption) include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, and fa ilure to thrive. Wasting syndrome may be a manifestation of chronic GVHD but is often multifactorial (e.g., decreased caloric intake, poor absorption, increased resting energy expenditures, and hypercatabolism). Endoscopic findings of mucosal edema and erythema or focal erosions with histologic changes of apoptotic epithelial cells and crypt cell dropout may be seen but are not considered diagnostic of chronic GVHD unless the patient also has distinctive features in a non- GI system. Patients with unresolved acute GVHD may have more severe intestin al mucosal lesions, including ulcers and mucosal sloughing. I. Liver Hepatic acute and chronic GVHD typically presents as cholestasis, with increased bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase, but it may also present as acute hepatitis. Because of many possible alternative diagnoses, liver biops y is required to confirm GVHD i nvolvement of the liver. Note that because of the histologic similarity between acute and chronic liver GVHD, the diagnosis of chronic GVHD cannot be made on the basis of liver biopsy alone but requires a distinctive manifestation in at leas t 1 other organ system. J. Lungs The only diagnostic manifestation of chronic GVHD is biopsy-proven BO. BO diagnosed via pulmonary function and radiologic te sting requires at least 1 other distinctive manifestation in a separate organ system to estab lish the diagnosis of chronic GVHD. BO is characterized by the new onset of an obstructive lung defect. Clinical manifestations may include dyspnea on exertion, cough, or wheezing. Some patients may be asym ptomatic early in the disease process. Pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum , and subcutaneous emphysema are rare and often represent advanced disease. Restrictive pulmonary function abnor malities secondary to advanced sclerosis of the chest wall are attributable to skin GVHD. BO is clinically diagnosed when all of the following criteria are met: 1.

BO-organizing pneumonia not due to infections may represen t a manifestation of either acute or chronic GVHD and is considered a common feature. K. Musculoskeletal System Diagnostic features include fascial involvement often affecting the forear ms or legs and often associated with sclerosis of the overlying skin and subcutaneous tissue. Fascial involvement may develop without overlying sc lerotic changes of the skin and can result in joint stiffness or contractures when present near joints. Fasciitis is detected on examination by stiffness, a restricted range of motion (e.g., often decreased dorsal wrist flexion or inability to assume a Buddha prayer posture), edema of the extremities with or without erythema (early sign), pe au d’orange (edematous skin with prominent pores resembling the surface of an orange), or joint contractures (late complications). Clinical myositis with tender muscles and increased muscle enzymes is a distinctive but nondiagnostic mani festation of chronic GVHD. Myos itis may present as proximal myopathy, but this complication is rare and does not explain the frequent complaints of severe cramps. Evaluation of myositis involves elect romyography and measurement of creatine phosphokinase or aldolase. Arthralg ia and arthritis are uncommon and are occasionally associated with the presence of autoantibodies. L.

Let us assume that the survival times, T1,T2,...,Tn, are i.i.d. with exponen tial density function f (T ,T) TeTT. Although an exponential model may not fit well for overall mortality, it usually provides a reasonable m odel over a short time frame for modeling toxicity, so in a ll discussion below we assume th at exponential survival times are censored at time point t. In the exponential pa rameterization, a t-day survival rate of p 0 translates into a mean survival of μ0=-t/ln(1-p 0) (rate parameter T0 -ln(1-p 0)/t). The SPRT is derived with reference to a simp le null and alternative hypothesis for the rate parameter, in this case, H0:T Toversus H1 :T T1 .

In practice, monitoring will be scheduled monthly after the start of enrollment to the study. A truncated version of the SPRT can be obtained by specifyi ng a maximum sample size. We truncate the SPRT by declaring that if the test has failed to terminate after the maximum sample size, that the null hypothesis will be accepted. Since the probability that the untruncated SPRT would reject the null at the maximum sample size is negligible, it makes little difference how the final boundary value is selected, and this rule is chosen for simplicity.

162,page_162,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 162 GUIDELINES FOR PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF PRES Mission Statement To describe the pathophysiology, clinical dia gnosis, prevention and mana gement of Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrom e (PRES). PRES is a disorder of reversible subcortical vasogenic brain edema with a constellation of acute neurological sympto ms and brain imaging findings of vasogenic edema predominantly invol ving the bilateral parieto-occipital regions. Patients with sickle cell disease are particularly susceptible to PRES.71,72 Pathophysiology PRES results from endothelial injury related to abrupt blood pressure changes or direct effects of cytokines on the endothelium, which leads to the breakdown of the blood–brain barrier and subsequent brain edema. With ear ly diagnosis and appr opriate management, PR ES is reversible, both radiographically and clinically, a nd generally has a favorable prognosis. Clinical Presentation Clinical presentation of PRES include73,74,75,76,77,78seizure (60–75%), ence phalopathy (50–80%), headache (50%), visual distur bances (33%), focal neurologica l deficit (10–15%), and Status epilepticus (5–15%). Symptoms typically occur in the setting of renal failure, blood pressure fluctuations, cytotoxic drugs, autoimmune di sorders, and pre-eclampsia or eclampsia.76 Calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-induced PRES may occu r with elevated blood pressure within days to weeks of CNI initiation and typically occu rs without elevated medication levels.79Clinical and radiographic recovery occur in 75–90% of patients w ith a mean time to full clinical recovery range of 2–8 days, although some patie nts can take several weeks to achieve full recovery.79,80,81,82 Concomitant GVHD with the use of steroids is an important risk factor for PRES.83 Imaging Brain imaging is useful to confirm the dia gnosis of PRES and to exclude alternative diagnoses.76,77,82,84Although vasogenic edema can be visuali zed using non-contrast CT in some patients, brain MRI (particularly T2-weighted sequences such as flui d-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR]) is much more sensitive.82,84Brain imaging usually reveals vasogenic edema in the parieto-occipital regions of both cerebral he mispheres. The subcortical white matter is always affected, and the cortex is also often involved. The e dema is usually asymmetric , but almost always bilateral. Three primary descriptive variations exist in approximately 70% of patients: a dominant parieto-occipital patter n, holo-hemispheric watershe d pattern, and superior frontal sulcus pattern. Neither the pattern nor the severity of brain edema, is associated with the type or severity of clinicalpresentation. 76,82 Differential Diagnosis"
163,page_163,"Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network Haplo Sickle Cell – Protocol 1507 Version 5.0 dated May 19, 2021 CONFIDENTIAL 163The symptoms and signs are non-specific, thus nece ssitating brain imaging with the primary intent to exclude alternative diagnoses. However, the di agnosis of PRES is not solely radiological; the clinical context and the judgment of the clinic ian are crucial to making the correct diagnosis. Differential diagnoses to be considered include infectious encephalitis, va sculitis, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder and progre ssive multifocal leucoencephalopathy. Risk factors in HCT predisposing to PRES Incidence of PRES in allo-HCT is 7-9% with greater risks with myeloablative than with non- myeloablative regimens (16% vs 3%). PRES co mmonly occurs in the first month following HCT and is associated with increased HLA mismatc h and with acute GVHD. Low –level neurotoxicity such as tremors, anxiety, and psychiatric dysfunction has been observed in 10%-40% of patients receive CNIs. Cyclosporine can induce endothe lial injury/dysfunction leading to enhanced vasoconstrictive effects, increased sympathetic ac tivation, and coagulation effects. Blood levels of Cyclosporine do not appear to correlate with se vere neurotoxicity or PRES. Immune challenge from the transplant such as rejection and GVHD, effects of chemotherapy, and sepsis may all contribute to the risk of PRES. Discontinuation or switch of CNIs usually results in clinical improvement. Unique Risk for PRES in patients with SCD undergoing HCT Patients with SCD have impaired dynamic cerebrovascular autoregulation with decreased ability to buffer the transfer of blood pressure surges to cerebral tissue 85as well as reduced cerebrovascular reserve capacity or vasodilatory capacity.86This may place them at unique risk for developing PRES. PRES has been reported in patients with SCD following severe acute chest syndrome, blood transfusion, hyper-transfusion with rapid increase in hemoglobin, recent use ofcorticosteroids, hypomagnes aemia, and in the absence of any precipitating factors.87,88,89,90,91 3HJHORZ&HWDO$P-0HG S- "

Control of Blood pressure. Blood pressure in patients w ith SCD has been reported to be lower than published standards for age, sex, and race-matched controls.95,96,97 Decreased survival has been observed for patients with SC D whose systolic or diastolic pressures were above the 90th percentile for HbSS subjects.97 Pressures above the 90t h percentile for HbSS may overlap levels considered normal in non-S CD patients. Blood pressures may be elevated with fluid infusions or use of medications su ch as corticosteroids or CNIs. Supportive care orders must indicate the importa nce of keeping BP within 10% above the median for age for HbSS patients as described by Pe gelow et al (Table I) or the baseline BP for the patient, whichever is lower. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) should be maintained at <70mmHg. Close monitoring and aggressive mana gement with anti-hypertensive agents will be required to prevent PRES. b.

Treatment and management of PRES The management of PRES consists of eliminating the precipitating cause, control of blood pressure and the institution of comprehensive supportive measures (Table 3). If PRES is caused by a specific medication, this medication should be discontinued. Failure to do so can perpetuate the syndrome. Alternative immunosuppression might be considered, but corticosteroids should be avoided. If steroids are added, careful consideration must be given to aggressive manageme nt of blood pressure. While it is important to treat the hypertension, the initial goal in treatin g patients with severe hypertensi on is to reduce blood pressure by 25% within the first few hours.3 Pronounced fluctuations of blood pressure should be avoided, and continuous infusions of intravenous drugs might be required. Excessive or rapid blood pressure reduction could provoke cerebra l ischemia. Seizures are treated with antiepileptic medications. Othe r underlying disorders, such as sepsis, and flare-ups of autoimmune disorders, should be treated. Table 3.

In patients who develop unexpected serious me dical complications or complicated vaso- occlusive pain episode (i.e., sickle cell pain episode complicated by acute chest syndrome, stroke, pneumonia, acute kidney injury, bacteremia/sepsis or splenic sequestration), hydroxyurea will be held and resumed at tr eating physician’s discretion. b. For adults prescribed hydroxyurea in 500 mg capsules, the hydroxyurea dose will be rounded up if dose calculation is between doses of 500 mg. If not tolerated, then the dose may be titrated down as indicated above7. c. Any modifications to the preparative regime n or drug stoppage should be reported to the BMT CTN DCC protocol coordinator for review and approval by the Protocol Chairs/Officer prior to con tinuation of the protocol."
