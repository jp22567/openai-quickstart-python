STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Study design: This is a n open, single -arm, multicenter extension study to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of long -term SOBI003 treatment in pediatric MPS IIIA patients . The study is an extension of the First in Human (FIH) SOBI003 -001 study , allowing continuous treatment of SOBI003 for up to 2 years. Study patients who complete Week 24 of the FIH study ( SOBI003 -001) will be invited to continue to Week 25 in the extension study. As the phase I/II study has a sequential, ascending, multiple -dose design, the first patients will enter t he extension study before finalization of the FIH study (SOBI003 -001). When entering the extension study, these patients will receive"

Upon completion of the FIH study, an analysis aimed at selecting the dose for forthcoming studies will take place. Once the dose has been selected, this dose will be applied to all patients enrolled in the extension study. SOBI003 is administered as weekly i.v. infusions over a period of tim e of 1 to 4 hours. Prior to initiation of each infusion, the patients are pretreated with a single dose of non -sedative antihistamine. If infusion -related reactions occur, then the infusion duration may be expanded up to 24 hours and supportive medication may be administered, at the discretion of the investigator. The long -term safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of SOBI003 will be assessed throughout the extension study whereas measurements of clinical efficacy and disease -related biomarkers will be p erformed at Weeks 52 and 104. The potential of SOBI003 to improve the neurocognitive function will be compared to published da ta from a recent NH study. The independent DMC employed in the FIH study ( SOBI003 -001) will continue to monitor safety and to lerab ility data in the SOBI003 -002 study at pre -specified intervals. The total duration of the extension study for an individual patient is 80 weeks , resulting in a total of 104 weeks (2 years) of SOBI003 treatment . Number of subjects planned: 9-12 Diagnosis and main criteria for inclusion: A patient must fulfill the following criteria in order to be included in the study: 1. Completion of study SOBI003 -001 2. Informed consent obtained from the patient’s legally authorized representative(s) Assessments for saf ety and tolerability evaluation : AEs are recorded from the time of obtained informed consent until End of Study. Blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry are assessed prior to ea ch infusion, mid - infusion and within 1 hour of completion of each infusion. Intensified assessments are applied for dose adjustments. Blood and urine samples for central laboratory analyses of hematology, coagulation , and clinical chemistry are collected prior to each infusion at Weeks 38, 52, 78 and 104, as well as during dose adjustment periods and at Early Termination. 12-lead ECGs are obtained Weeks 52 and 104, and at Early Termination . A physical and neurological examination will be performed at Weeks 52 and 104, and at Early Termination . General appearance and skin are examined prior to and within 1 hour of completion of each infusion. Blood samples for central laboratory analyses of ADAs are taken pre-infusion at Weeks 38, 52, 78 and 104, and at Early Termination . For patients discontinuing treatment , ADA is assessed 30 to 40 days after last SOBI003 administration. CSF samples for centr al laboratory analysis of ADAs are collected at Weeks 52 and 10 4."

In addition, serum PK samples are collected when ADA samples are obtained. SOBI003 concentration in CSF is assessed at Weeks 52 and 104. HS is assessed in urine and serum at Weeks 38, 52, 78 and 104. HS in CSF is assessed at Weeks 52 and 104. Assessments for efficacy evaluation : Neurocognition is assessed by the BSID -III and/or KABC -II at Weeks 52 and 104. Adaptive behavior is assessed by the VABS -II at Weeks 52 and 104. Gray matter volume is assessed by MRIs Weeks 5 2 and 104. The PedsQL is completed by the parent/primary caregiver at Weeks 52 and 104. Assessments for other efficacy evaluation : Clinical manifestations, including language, motor function, and sleep pattern are assessed at Weeks 52 and 104. Brain and abdominal MRIs are performed at Weeks 52 and 104 to assess ventricles, white matter, basal ganglia, and liver and spleen volumes . Test product; dose and mode of administration: SOBI003, 20 mg/ml, concentrate for solution for i.v. infusion. When entering the extension study, these patients will receive the highest dose that has been declared safe in the ongoing FIH study ( SOBI003 -001). Upon completion of the FIH study, an analysis aimed at selecting the dose for fo rthcoming studies will take place. Once the dose has been selected, this dose will be applied to all patients enrolled in the extension study. Reference product; dose and mode of administration: Not applicable. Duration of treatment(s): 80 weeks (104 we eks total of SOBI003 treatment) Statistical methods: Safety tabulations of AE data and laboratory data are performed. Continuous variables are summarized using the number of patients, the mean, the standard deviation, the median, the minimum value, and the maximum value. Categorical variables are summarized using frequency counts a nd percentages. Change from baseline in DQ of neurocognitive development at Week 104 and change from baseline in CSF HS at Week 104 will be evaluated jointly in a hierarchical approach. DQ of neurocognitive development will be evaluated using a repeated m easures analysis with the DQ measurements at the individual time points as response, and visit and visit -treatment interaction as fixed factors, baseline age as covariate and an unstructured covariance matrix will be used to estimate the covariance pattern . The control is an untreated group of MPS IIIa patients from a NH trial. The null hypothesis of no treatment effect will be tested with a significance test for the treatment*time -effect in the second step of the multiple testing procedure . The difference between 104 weeks and baseline will be used as the contrast of interest for the test . To assess the PD effect of SOBI003 on HS levels in CSF, serum and urine, linear models are used to model the change from baseline in HS levels as dependent variable, for both logged HS levels and untransformed HS levels, and baseline level and age as continuous covariates, and accumulated dose as covariate and sex as factor. The analyses are conducted for each assessment time point. In addition, linear analyses with HS le vels, both logged HS levels and untransformed HS levels, in CSF, serum and urine, as dependent variable, and baseline level and age as continuous covariates, and accumulated dose as covariate and sex as factor will be performed across all assessments, with"

The time effect is used to judge the HS level change in CSF. The null hypothesis of no change will be tested with a significance test for the time -effect in the first step of the multiple testing procedure. The difference between 104 weeks and baseline will be used as the contrast of interest for the test. PK results are presented by dose level using descriptive statistics. Immunogenicity is summarized using frequency counts and percentages by dose level and will be evaluated regarding antibody prevalence (pre -existing antibodies), antibody incidence, titer and boosting following dosing, impact on PK and PD. Adaptive behavior will be analyzed with the same repeated measures model as DQ, but adapted for one group (i.e. no treatment*visit interaction term). To assess the PD effect of SOBI003 on MRI, linear models are used to model the change from baseline in MRI as dependent variable for both logged MRI and untransformed MRI, and baseline level and age as continuous covariates, and accumulated dose (including the FIH study) as covariate and sex as factor. The analyses will be conducted for each assessment time point: week 52 and 104. In addition, linear analyses with MRI levels (both logged MRI levels and untransformed MRI levels ), as dependent variable, and baseline level and age as continuous covariates, and accumulated dose as covariate and sex as factor will be performed across all assessments (including the FIH study) , with assessment as a repeated factor. Endpoints relating to other neurocognit ive variables , liver and spleen volume, QoL, language, motor function and sleep pattern are summarized using descriptive statistics. PK results are presented by dose level using descriptive statis tics. In addition, results are presented by demographic characteristics, e.g., age -group and bodyweight, as applicable."

MPS IIIA is a rare disease with rapid progression from early childhood, often resulting in death during the 2nd or 3rd decade of life. Currently there is no approved treatment and to date, therapy is limited to treatment and relief of symptoms. The unmet medical need is therefore high."

Patients completing the 24 -week, open -label treatment period of the FIH study ( SOBI003 -001) with SOBI003 will be offered enrolment into this extension study . The current study will be a direct continuation of the FIH study ( SOBI003 -001), thus commencing with Week 25 and ending at Week 104, giving a total SOBI003 treatment duration of 2 years. 5.1 Background 5.1.1 MPS IIIA MPS IIIA or Sanfilippo A, is an inher ited LSD that is progressive, life-shortening and rare. MPS IIIA is one of 4 distinct subtypes of MPS III (denoted IIIA, IIIB, IIIC and IIID) ( 3). MPS IIIA is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the SGSH gene that result in absence of or a deficiency in the enzyme sulfamidase (N -sulfoglucosamine sulfohydrolase). Lack of sulfamidase activity leads to insufficient degradation of HS and lysosomal accumulation of HS and its metabolites in lysosomes throughout the body ( 4). As of today, 142 mutations have been described in the SGSH gene coding for sulfamidase ( 5). Data suggest a geno - and phenotype correlation and that patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for the S298P mutation have a slower progression of the disease ( 6). Depending on disease severity, patients have a median life -expectancy of about 15 years. The clinical course of MPS IIIA can be divided into 3 phases ( 7). In the first phase, which usually starts between 1 and 4 years of age, a developmental delay becomes apparent after an initial normal deve lopment during the first 1 to 2 years of life. The most prominent finding in this phase is speech delay ( 6, 7, 8). The diagnosis of MPS IIIA is usually established during the second phase, which generally starts around 3 to 4 years of age. This phase is characterized by increasing behavioral problems with hyperactivity, aggressive and destructiv e behavior as well as reduced attention span (7), which responds poorly to standard medications and behavioral -based interventions ( 9). A pronounced and rapid decline in cognitive skills becomes evident and the sleeping pattern is disturbed with extreme difficulty in falling asleep and with frequent awakening ( 10). In the third and final “quiet” phase , behavioral symptoms diminish while motor retardation emerges with walking and s wallowing difficulties sometimes requiring percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding. The progressive neurodegeneration causes spasticity, seizures, loss of speech, and severe dementia , which ultimately results in a vegetative state ( 9). Patients usually die from respiratory infections in the end of the second or beginning of the third decade of life ( 11) although patients with a slowly progressing phenotype may live longer ( 6)."

SOBI003 is a sterile solution for i .v. infusion after dilution . In this extension study, SOBI003 is administered once weekly. By modification of the sulfamidase glycans, the uptake of SOBI003 systemically is strongly reduced. This translates into a reduced serum clearance as demonstrated in mice. SOBI003 passes the blood -brain barrier (BBB) presumably by passive transcytosis, whereby the increased plasma exposure facilitates generation of pharmacological relevant levels of SOBI003 in the central nervous system (CNS ) compartment. Once SOBI003 enters the target cells and reaches the lysosomal compartment, it shows enzymatic activity and stability comparable to that of unmodified sulfamidase, as demonstrated in fibroblasts of MPS IIIA patients. 5.1.3 SOBI003 nonclinical development In a MPS IIIA mouse model with a spontaneous missense mutation of the SGSH gene, disease manifestations similar to the human conditions are obtained, includi ng lysosomal storage of HS and neurological pathology. In these mice, repeated i.v. administration of SOBI003 resulted in a dose and time dependent clearance of HS in brain. The reduction in HS translated into improvements in terms of lysosomal size and neuroinflammation as well as beneficial effects on behavior al impairments . HS reduction in cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF) correlated with reduction of HS in whole brain of MPS IIIA mice following repeated i.v. administration of SOBI003 , thus support ing the use of HS reduction in CSF as a biomarker of disease modification. In MPS IIIA mice, a relationship between treatment effect and SOBI003 dose level and treatment duration was observed . The reduction of HS in brain was related to the accumulated active SOBI003 dose. The return to baseline HS biomarker levels after discontinuation of treatment was also a gradual process in this mouse model. To quantify and understand the dose, time, concentration and effect relationship in MPS IIIA mice, a semi -mechanist ic in silico model was developed based on mouse PK, distribution of SOBI003 to the brain, SOBI003 entering target cells, the intracellular retention of SOBI003 and an intracellular SOBI003 concentration - effect relationship on HS reduction. Human fibroblast s of an MPS IIIA patient ( 27) were used for in vitro determination of SOBI003 cell entry rate, cell retention, and intracellular concentration -effect relationship. Al lometric scaling from rat and cynomolgus monkey to human was applied to predict clearance and volume of distribution in patients (body weight 20 kg). Translating the mouse in silico model to human repeated weekly administration of 3 mg/kg, SOBI003 is predi cted to gradually achieve a brain HS reduction of ~ 35 % after 3 months and ~ 45 % after 6 months treatment. Thus, according to model -based simulations using the in silico model, the 3 mg/kg dose level is expected to gradually elicit a pharmacological effe ct in CNS in humans. Repeated weekly administration of 10 and 20 mg/kg SOBI003 is predicted to achieve a brain HS reduction of ~ 75 % and~ 80 % after 3 months and ~ 80 % and ~ 85 % respectively after 6 months treatment relative to baseline."
22,page_22,"Sobi SOBI003 Clinical Study No: SOBI003 -002 Confidential Page 23 of 84 Version 1.0, Final Date 29 Jun 2018 Nonclinical saf ety assessments have been performed to support the SOBI003 development program. The nonclinical safety studies were performed in accordance to international standards for drug development and OECD Principles of GLP. A 3 -month toxicity study was performed i n MPS IIIA mice, a disease model to evaluate any potential interactions of the drug and the disease. A 1 -month toxicity study in healthy non -human primates (cynomolgus monkey) was also performed. In addition, to support the clinical development in pediatri c patients, juvenile rats were treated for one month from 10 days up to 5 weeks of age, which corresponds to a life - span in humans ranging from neonates up to the age of 6 years. Throughout the nonclinical safety program SOBI003 was administered by i.v. infusion every third day following p re- treatment with anti-histamine to appropriately resemble the clinical treatment regimen. In the species tested, the treated animals did not show any signs of adverse effects. Thus, the safety eval uation of SOBI003 has shown that it is well -tolerated . In favor of SOBI003 treatment was also improvements in the disease state in MPS IIIA mice , such as lower incidences and/or severity of microscopic findings and with lower kidney, liver and spleen weigh ts. However, the histopathological examinations revealed that the treatment of all three species at higher doses were associated with an accumulation of eosinophilic material in the cytoplasm of macrophages of various origin; liver, lymph nodes and the hea rt. The observations were clearly dose dependent and did not cause any detected harmful effects or other negative consequences to the animals. The observations were partially reversible after 4 weeks withdrawal of treatment. The anomalies were judged to be a result of a normal physiological function of tissue macrophages to scavenge proteins and the observed accumulation may be due to the high protein load. Thus, since these findings were not considered as adverse the NOAEL was set to the highest dose admin istered in the three species tested, i.e., 300 mg/kg in the mice and rats and 150 mg/kg in the cynomolgus monkeys . The lowest SOBI003 serum exposures at the NOAEL dose levels in these species were observed in the mice following the 300 mg/kg dose, where m ean C max,ss was 86.3 and 163 μmol/L and mean AUC τ,ss was 718 and 934 μmol*h/L in in male and female mice, respectively. Based on predicted steady state PK in patients (C max,ss 0.89, 3.0, and 5.9 μmol/L; AUC τ,ss 11.5, 38.5, and 77.0 h·μmol/L at dose levels 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg), the margins to SOBI003 exposure in the pivotal toxicity studies are thus at least 100 -fold for a starting dose of 3 mg/kg and at least 10 - fold for a dose of 20 mg/kg. Further details are presented in the SOBI003 Investigator Brochure ). 5.1.4 SOBI003 immun e mediated reactions In an initial explorative study in MPS IIIA mice, where the efficacy of 3 different sulfamidase derivatives was assessed (whereof SOBI003 was one), Sobi encountered hypersensitivity reactions. Mice were given the test art icles at 30 mg/kg every other day as a bolus injection without antihistamine pretreatment. The study was terminated due to hypersensitivity reactions in connection with the fifth i.v. dose. A second study was performed, where the mice were pretreated with the antihistamine chlorpheniramine, and the injection rate was extended to approximately 5 to 10 seconds per injection. The same test articles, doses, and dose frequencies were applied as in the initial study, and the second study could be finalized as pla nned without"

Subsequently, antihistamine pretreatment was included in the chronic efficacy studies. The nonclinical studies in MPS IIIA mice show that ADAs are generated against SOBI003. In the studies performed with anti -histamine pretreatment, including the 3 month toxicity study t he ADA response does not compromise safety or alter the exposure, as assessed at 24 hours after last dose administration. A num ber of chronic efficacy studies have been performed with antihistamine pretreatment in MPS IIIA mice without observing any obvious toxicities or lack of efficacy. In cynomolgus monkey a repeated dose paradigm with doses once every third day indicated that ADAs had an impact on SOBI003 exposure. ADAs did not appear to impact the Cmax in plasma, but possibly the AUC. Apart from these deviations, exposure after the last dose was similar to that observed after the first dose. No ADA development was seen in the pivotal juvenile rat toxicity study . Development of ADAs is a common finding in ERTs and correlates to the degree of endogenous enzyme expression ( 12, 13, 14, 15). Nonclinical assessments of immunogenicity of human proteins, applying in silico , in vitro , or animal models have, so far, shown only limited or no translatability to the clinical situation. The polypeptide sequence of SOBI003 is identical to human sulfamidase. However, as a result of use of the CHO expression system and the glycan m odifications, through which some peripheral carbohydrate ring structures in the glycans are linearized, the overall structure of SOBI003 is not identical to human sulfamidase. Therefore, an immune reaction to SOBI003 may be expected in analogy to what occu rs with other ERTs. ADAs and their impact on safety, PK and PD are monitored closely in this extension study. 5.1.5 Study ra tionale SOBI003 is being developed for treatment of MPS IIIA. Scientific advice on the nonclinical and chemistry, manufacturing and control (CMC) development has been obtained from the FDA on 16 February 2016 and from EMA in 28 June 2016. A pre -IND meeting was held with the FDA on 21 June 2017 to obtain agreement on the conduct of the FIH study ( SOBI003 -001) with SOBI 003. The FIH study ( SOBI003 -001) is designed to assess the safety, tolerability, PK, PD and immunogenicity of SOBI003 at 3 dose levels to provide knowledge needed to optimize the further evaluation of SOBI003 in patients with MPS IIIA . Patients completing the 24 -week, open -label treatment period of the FIH study will be offered enrolment into the extension study SOBI003 -002. Study SOBI 003-002 is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of long -term SOBI003 treatment and to evaluate the efficacy of S OBI003 in improving neurocognitive function and other measures indicative of a favorable outcome of SOBI003 treatme nt. The follow -up period of the extension study is 80 weeks , giving a total SOBI003 treatment duration of 104 weeks to allow for a comparison with data from a recent NH study (22)."

SOBI003 provides a potential clinical benefit by reducing the levels of stored HS and its metabolites , and thereby reducing neuro -inflamma tion and the clinical manifestations of MPS IIIA. Apart from ADA development in two species (MPS IIIA mouse and cynomolgus monkey) out of the three included in the pivotal toxicity program, which is an expected finding conside ring the foreignness of a huma n protein to animal species, the nonclinical safety evaluation of SOBI003 did not show any signs of adverse effects , thus SOBI003 was well-tolerated . Given the observed pharmacological and toxicology profile in non -clinical studies , and following patient completion of 24 weeks treatment in the FIH study ( SOBI003 -001), it is judged that SOBI003 can be given to patients in a carefully monitored extension study. Adherence to study inclusion/exclusion criteria and close clinical monitoring will be appl ied. Although SOBI003 has been given for 24 weeks in the 001 -study, h ypersensitivity reactions/immune -mediated adverse reactions may still occur , including anaphylaxis and infusion reactions, are commonly reported for lysosomal ERTs. To reduce the incidenc e and severity of these adverse reactions, slow infusion rates, prolonged infusion duration and pretreatment with antihistamines will be applied. Severe and potentially life -threatening adverse hypersensitivity/immune -mediated reactions may , however , still occur. Close clinical supervision by medical staff that are experienced with ERT treatment will be applied during and after the infusions. This will ensure early detection and adequate treatment of potential adverse reactions. Potential hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic events and infusion related reactions will be treated in accordance with the current anaphylactic algorithm (17). Further s ymptomatic treatment with antipyretics and additional antihistamines may be administered to manage milder hypersensitivity/immune -mediated reactions. Immunosuppressant treatment will be administered in cases of less tolerable reactions. In addition, the availability of cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment and immediate access to emergency medical services is secured. Potential delayed hypersensitivity reactions may occur outside the hospital setting (refer to Table 1) for minimum hospitalization periods during study participation). Parents/caregivers will be carefully informed of potential signs and symptoms of delayed hype rsensitivity reactions and of the importance to seek immediate medical attention. SOBI003 has the potential to become the first disease modifying therapy in patients with MPS IIIA. The disease -modifying effect of SOBI003 is believed to be most beneficial if treatment is started in very young patients since they have limited neuronal damage. SOBI003 could possibly stop, or reverse, the progress of the neuronal damage and the neurocognitive decline leading to a normal or a near normal neurocognitive developm ent. In older patients, that have more pronounced neuronal damage, it is likely that already developed neuronal damage is not reversible . However, further disease progression might be prevented or at least slowed down ."
25,page_25,"Sobi SOBI003 Clinical Study No: SOBI003 -002 Confidential Page 26 of 84 Version 1.0, Final Date 29 Jun 2018 The ultimate effect of the disease m odifying effect would be to improve the cognition and thereby prolong life, minimize behavioral problems and sleep disturbances, and increase QoL including reduction of caregiver burden. The evaluation of the benefits of SOBI003 treatment in pediatric pati ents with MPS IIIA is based on the results in the SOBI003 non -clinical studies showing reduced levels of stored HS and its metabolites in brain and CSF, reduction of neuroinflammation in brain, reduction of lysosomal swelling and secondary storage products in brain as well as trends towards a beneficial effect on behavioral impairment. If t ranslated to human these beneficial effects may reduce the devastating clinical manifestations of MPS IIIA . Potential s tudy procedural risks include the use of sedation/ general anesthesia and use of a central venous access port. To minimize study related procedural risks, local hospital routines will be applied for the procedures. The selection of anesthetic method will be in accordance with local hospital routines and as judged by pediatric anesthesiologist with prior experience from MPS patients. The parents/caregivers will be trained in management of the port, in accordance with local hospital routines. This includes the actions to take in case an infection is suspected. The central venous access port is added as part of the preceding FIH study ( SOBI003 -001), but there may be occasions when a patient may need to replace an existing port .

Patients completing the 24-week treatment of the FIH study will be offered to participate in th e continuous 80 week treatm ent period of the extension study. The extension study starts with enrolment at Week 25, giving a total SOBI003"

Please refer to Figure 1 for an overview of the study design. A recent NH study is used as external control (22) to enable an evaluation of efficacy . Neurocognitive and adaptive behavior data assessed in the extension study at Week 52 and Week 104 following start of treatment will be compared to available NH data within t he target study population. The NH population for comparison consists of 14 patient s with a rapid progressive MPS II IA disease and a baseline age of 12 to 72 months . As the FIH study ( SOBI003 -001) has a sequential, ascending, multiple -dose design , the first patients will enter the extension study before the FIH study is completed . When e ntering the extension study, these patients will receive the highest dose that has been declared safe by the SRC in the ongoing FIH study ( SOBI003 -001) study . Patients enrolled in Cohort 1 of FIH study may thus be switched to the dose applied in Cohort 2 or Cohort 3 , depending on safety clearance by the SRC. If a patient is initially switched to the dose applied in Cohort 2, the patient may subsequently later be switched to the dose applied in Cohort 3. Depending on recruitment rate in the FIH study ( SOBI003 -001) study , a patient enrolled in Cohort 1 may be directly switched to the dose applied in Cohort 3. Upon completion of the FIH study , an analysis aimed at selecting the dose for forthcoming studies will take pla ce. Once the dose has been selected , this dose will be applied to all patients e nrolled in the extension study. SOBI003 is administered as weekly i.v. infusions over a period of time of 1 to 4 hours. Prior to initiation of each infusion, the patients are pretreated with a single dose of non -sedative antihistamine. If infusion -related reactions occur, then the infusion duration may be expanded up to 24 hours and supportive medication may be adm inistered , at the discretion of the investigator. The long -term s afety , tolerability and immunogenicity of SOBI003 will be assessed throughout the extension study whereas measurements of clinical efficacy and disease -related biomarkers will be performed at Weeks 52 and 104. The potential of SOBI003 to improve the neurocognitive function will be compared to published data from a recent NH study (22). The indepen dent DMC employed in the FIH study ( SOBI003 -001) will continue to monitor safety and immunogenicity data in the SOBI003 -002 study . Following completion of the extension study, depending on demonstrated safety, tolerability and benefit -risk evaluation of SOBI003, study patients’ continuous access to SOBI003 treatment may be arranged as part of a Sobi-sponsored extension study starting in direct connection to th e study, or through an alternative ethically and regulatory accepted approach .

In the case of treatment of MPS IIIA, no active compara tor exists and Sobi does not consider it ethical to withhold a potentially efficient treatment in patients with a rapidly progressive, and life -shortening condition. Data from a recent NH study ( 22) will therefore serve as control for the studies in the SOBI003 clinical program. In order to compare SOBI003 treatment with the NH study , comparable patients will be included and the time points for efficacy evaluations and the neurocognitive and behavior al tools used will be identical. The efficacy endpoints in the SOBI003 clinical development program have been selected based on the recommendations in a position statement by key experts in the f ield, the clinical relevance ( 24, 25, 26 ) as well as on the endpoints in the NH study ( 22). The efficacy analysis will be based on data 2 years after the start of the FIH study ( SOBI003 -001), baseline being baseline assessments in the FIH study. The choice of treatment duration is based on advice from key clinical experts in t he area and the availability of NH data. It is considered long enough to differentiate efficacy of SOBI003 treatment compared to an untreated control. The dose in the SOBI003 -002 study will primarily be selected on the basis of safety and tolerability results and the magnitude of HS reduction in CSF observed for the dose l evels i n the FIH study (SOBI003 -001). At enrolment into the extension study (SOBI003 -002), the individual dose will be adjusted to the highest tolerable dose level in order to optimize treatment duration on an efficacious dose. Upon completion of the FIH study, an analysis aimed at selecting the dose for forthcoming studies will take place. Once the dose has been selected , this dose will be applied to all patients enrolled in the extension study. 7.3 Selection of study po pulation 7.3.1 Inclusion criteria A patie nt must fulfill the following criteria in order to be included in the study: 1.

During the informed consent process, the investigator will clari fy that it is essential for the patient’s safety to be willing to comply with the study protocol requirements, including study safety and immunogenicity assessments following a potential withdrawal of study treatment. When a patient is withdrawn from study treatment, the date and time of the last SOBI003 infusion and the date and reason for treatment withdrawal should be clearly described in the relevant sections of the case report form (CRF). If a patient is removed from treatment because of an AE, th e reason for treatment withdrawal should always be stated as ‘ AE’ irrespective of whether this was the investigator’s or the patient’s primary caregiver(s) decision. After treatment withdrawal, efficacy, safety, immunogenicity and PK assessments should be completed as soon as possible and repeated 30 to 40 days after the last SOBI003 administration , as specified for “Early Termination” in the Schedule of Events ( Table 2). When possible, study assessments (excluding SOBI003 infusion) of Weeks 38, 52, 78 and 104 should continue in accordance with t he Schedule of Events ( Table 2) in order to collect continuous immunogenicity, safety and efficacy data for study patients following withdrawn treatment . Additional safety assessments will be performed at the discretion of the investigator, as warranted by the AE(s) leading to treatment withdrawal. A patient that is withdrawn from study treatment due to an AE, should be followed up until the AE(s) leading to treatment withdrawal are either resolved or have stabilized even after the patient’s participation in the study is over. Each clinically significant abnormal laboratory value or other clinically meaningful abnormality should be followed until the abnormality resolves or until a decision is made that it is not likely to resolve . Should the 30 to 40 -day post last infusion be ADA -positive, then the ADA titer will be determined and ADA samplings will continue at approximately monthly basis until the ADA s have disappeared or titers have stabilized at a lower level. Every time an ADA sample is taken, a corresponding PK assessment is done. 7.3.3.2 Withdraw al from stu dy The patient’s legally authorized representative is free to withdraw the patient from the study at any time. A patient that is withdrawn from the study should be examined as soon as possible , whenever possible, irrespective of the reason for withdrawal .

The hospitalization period may be e xtended as per local routine for admission/discharge and per patient need as determined by the investigator (e.g., concurre nt illness and travel distance ). Following a dose adjustment , patients are hospitalized for at least 48 hours after initiation of each of the first 3 infusion s. If dose adjustment is a decrease in dose as a result of study dose selection for forthcoming studies, and there are no safety concerns, the patient may be discharged 1 hour or later after the end of each infusion. 7.4 Treatments 7.4.1 Treatme nts admin istered In thi s open -label study, the investigational medicinal product (IMP) is SOBI003. SOBI003 is administered as i.v. infusions given o nce weekly for a duration of 80 weeks (from Week 25 until W eek 104 following the first 24 weeks of IMP administration in the FIH study (SOBI003 -001) study . SOBI003 solution , 20 mg/mL, is mixed with NaCl 0.9% infusion solution prior to administration. For a bodyweight < 25 kg, the total infusion vol ume is 10 0 mL. For a bodyweight ≥ 25 kg, the total infusion volume is 250 mL. Actual materials to be used for mixing SOBI003 solution with NaCl infusion solution (i.e., infusion solutions, syringes and needles) and for administering the infusions (i.e., infusion lines, syringes, manifolds, venous access ports) must be preapproved by Sobi to secure that all materials are compatible with SOBI003.

The planned dosage range for the FIH study is 3 to 20 mg/kg . Patients enrolled in Cohort 1 of the FIH study ( SOBI003 -001) study may thus be s witched to the dose applied in Cohort 2 or Cohort 3, depending on safety clearance by the SRC. If a patient is initially switched to the dose applied in Cohort 2, the patient may subsequently be switched to the dose applied in Cohort 3. Depending on recrui tment rate in the FIH study, a patient enrolled in Cohort 1 may be directly switched to the dose applied in Cohort 3. Upon completion of the FIH study ( SOBI003 -001) study , an analysis aimed at selecting the dose for forthcoming studies will take place. The analysis is conducted by Sobi and will be based on risk-benefit observed for the doses applied during the FIH study. Once the dose has been selected , this dose will be applied to all patients enrolled in the extension study. This may result in a decrease or increase of all current patient doses in the extension study. Dose adjustment s will be avoided during the 4 -week period pr ior to Week 52 and 104 in orde r to avoid interference with study efficacy assessments. Any requested dose adjustment during this time should be postponed , if not considered medically justified by the investigator . Patients will be extensively monitored during dose adjustments as descri bed in S ection 7.5.1.7 . 7.4.5 Selection and timing of doses for each patient SOBI003 is administered as weekly i.v. infusions. The infusions are administered by qualifi ed health care professionals . Every effort should be made to have the infusions administered every 7th day. A +/ - 1-day window is applied i.e., if the first infusion in study FIH study ( SOBI003 - 001) was administered on a Wednesday, then the infusions in the extension study can be administered on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays . In case of signs and/or symptoms of ongoing infection at subsequent infusion occasions, infusion may be postponed, as judg ed by the investigator. If the infusion needs to be postponed more than"
36,page_36,"Sobi SOBI003 Clinical Study No: SOBI003 -002 Confidential Page 37 of 84 Version 1.0, Final Date 29 Jun 2018 3 days, then the investigator should discuss with the Sponsor’s MD to determine the timing of the next infusion (i.e., whether to await the next scheduled infusion). Within 30 to 60 mi nutes prior to each infusion, a single dose of a non-sedative antihistamine should be administered. The antihistamine can either be e.g., cetirizine, levo-cetirizine, loratadine, des -loratadine or fexofenadine, and the administered doses will be in compliance with locally approved labeling. The antihistamine agent is selected at the discretion of the investigator. Antipyretic medication may also be administered, at the discretion of the investigator . The actual dose s of SOBI003 to be administered should be based on the patient’s body weight at 4-week intervals (i.e., t he actual dose administered at W eeks 25 to 28 is based on the body weight obtained pre -infusion at W eek 25 , the actual dose administered at W eeks 29 to 32 is based on the body weight obtained pre -infusion at W eek 29 , etc.). The body weight is obtained either on the day prior to the infusion or the day of infusion . For a body weight < 25 kg, the targeted total infusion volume is 100 mL. For a body weight ≥ 25 kg, the targeted total infusion volume is 25 0 mL. If the infusion bag contains an overfill volume, the infusion should continue until the infusion bag is emptied. The final concentration of SOBI003 in the infusion bag will be calculated based on the added volume of SOBI003 to the infusion bag, and the total volume in the infusion bag. The SOBI003 infusions are initially given over a period of 4 hours. When no more dose increases are expected , and the intensified study assessments associated with d ose adjustments are completed (Section 7.5.1.7 ), the infusion period in individual patients may step-wise be decreased at the discretion of the investigator. The minimal infusion period is 1 hour. Infusion rate schedules are provided in a separate IMP manual . The drug accountability records will capture sufficient details to verify the amount of SOBI003 administered at each infusion occasion. In case of occurr ence of infusion reactions, the infusion duration may be prolonged up to 24 hours at the discretion of the investigator. For individual study patients there may be situations, due to safety or infusion related reactions observed at a higher dose level, whe re it is judged by investigator that it is in the patient’s best interest to reduce the treatment dose. In such situations investigator should discuss with Sobi MD regarding a n individual patient dose adjustment. 7.4.6 Prior and concomitant thera py Other therap ies considered necessary for the patient’s welfare including melatonin for sleep disorder may be given at the discretion of the investigator. Patients on low dose genistein (<10 mg/kg/day) may continue treatment on the same dose throughout the study. All s uch therapy that is administered or used from the time of enrolment until completion of the study must be recorded in the CRF. This includes prescription drugs, herbal products, vitamins, minerals, and over -the-counter medications and the anesthetic drugs administered during study"

Preferably, the treatment regimen should be unaltered during the study and thus only adjusting dose or medication(s) when medically warranted. No other medicinal product under investigation may be us ed concomitantly with the IMP in this study. As described in Section 7.4.5 , a single dose of a non -sedative antihistamine should be administ ered prior to start of each SOBI003 infusion. Each administration is recorded in the CRF. In case of identified infusion -related reactions, immediate treatment is given at the discretion of the investigator. Depending on symptoms, this may e.g., be antipyr etics such as acetaminophen (paracetamol), corticosteroids or additional antihistamines. Anaphylactic reactions will be treated in accordance with current anaphylaxis algorithm “Hypersensitivity to Biological Agents - Updated Diagnosis, Management, and Tre atment” issued by the AAAI ( 17). Necessary equipment for resuscitation must be available during study drug infusion . If clinically justified, patients who develop high titer antibodies that affect PK/PD and/or safety may benefit from the use of an immune tolerizing regimen . As there is no proven immune tolerizing approach established for ERTs in MPS IIIA, immune tolerizing approaches used in other LSDs ( 22) may be applied at the discretion of the investigator after discussion with Sobi Medical Director . 7.4.7 Treatm ent com pliance Product accountability records will be kept. The pharmacy and investigator must maintain accurate records demonstr ating date and amount of IMP received, to whom and by whom administered (patient -by-patient accounting), and accounts o f returned IMP and any IMP accidentally or deliberately destroyed. All unused IMP will be counted. At the end of the study, any remaining IMP will be returned to Almac for destruction, or destroyed locally.

The neurocognitive developmental age (months) is derived on the basis of the BSID -III cognitive total raw score and BSID -III age -normative data. The neurocognitive developmental age (months) is derived from the mean AEq scores on the NVI of the KABC -II, where an AEq scores is the average score for a particular age. The Development Quotient (DQ) is obtained by dividing the neurocognitive developmental age with chronological age. For patients completing an ass essment of both BSID -III and KABC -II, the BSID -III score will be used as a basis for calculating the DQ of neurocognitive development at baseline. A calibration of overlapping AEq scores between BDID -III and KABC -II will be done to assess if a patient outg rows the BSID -III test during the duration of the study. If confirmed, assessments of KABC -II will form the basis for calculating DQ of neurocognitive development for remaining study assessments. Neurocognition assessments are performed by child developme nt specialists/psychologists with prior experience of MP S IIIA patients. Each patient should preferably have the same assessor throughout the study in order to reduce potential variability. When practically feasible, the aim should be to have the assessmen ts performed in rested children early during the day, i.e., prior to 1 pm. The aim should also be to roughly keep the same assessment time point for an individual child, i.e., morning/afternoon.

The aim is to ensure that at least 5 days of evaluable recordings are obtained on each occasion. A daily wear time of 20 hours per day will be re garded as a compliant recording. The recording will be supported by an actigraph log. Recorded actigraph data will be evaluated using the accompanying software developed by the manufacturer. A subset of the actigraphy data is coded to be analyzed in a subsequent separate blinded analysis of the manually edited dataset. The following parameters will be determined on the basis of recordings in the actigraph log : • Bedtime (c lock time child is p ut to bed ) • Wake time (c lock time child is taken out of bed ) • Time in bed (t ime between Bedtime and Wake time) The following variable s are derived as obtained from the actigraph software : • Sleep onset (c lock time for ﬁrst appearance of a predetermined number of consecutive min of sleep) • Sleep offset (c lock time for last of a predetermined number of consecutive min of sleep) • Sleep period (t ime between sleep onset and sleep offset) • Total sleep time (TST, d uration of sleep in sleep period) • Wake after sleep onset (WASO, number of minutes scored as wake during sleep period)"

The Sadeh algorithm ( 28) is used for determining which epochs (1 -minute recordings) are marked as “sleep” versus which are marked as “awake”. The Tudor -Locke method is applied to determine sleep periods, where 5 con secutive minutes of recorded “sleep” defines Sleep onset and where 10 consecutive minutes of “awake” time defines Sleep offset. 7.5.4 Safet y ass essments 7.5.4.1 Adve rse e vents Definitions Adve rse e vent An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or trial subje ct administered a pharmaceutical product ; the event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with th e treatment or usage. AEs include the following: • Abnormal test findings , as specified below . • Clinically significant signs and symptoms . • Changes in ph ysical examination findings . • Unexpected p rogression/worsening of underlying disease . In addition, signs and symptoms resulting from the following should also be handled according to the same principles as A Es: • Overdose . • Withdrawal of treatment . • Interactions . • Abuse . • Misuse . Abnormal test findings An abnormal test finding , e.g. abnormal laboratory analysis results, vital signs or ECG, should be recorded as an A E in any of the following situations: • The test is associated with accompanying symptoms . Note, that the symptom , not the test result, should be recorded as an AE ."
63,page_63,"Sobi SOBI003 Clinical Study No: SOBI003 -002 Confidential Page 64 of 84 Version 1.0, Final Date 29 Jun 2018 • The test result leads to a medical/surgical intervention including withdrawal of IMP(s) or discontinuation from the study . Repeat/confirmatory testing is not considered a medical int ervention. • The investigator considers the test result to be clinically significant . Preexistin g conditions A preexisting condition (i.e., a disorder present before the AE reporting period started and noted on the pretre atment medical history/physical examination form of the FIH study (SOBI003 -001) should not be reported as an AE unless the condition worsens or episodes increase in frequency during the AE reporting period. Procedures Diagnostic and therapeutic non -invasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery, should not be reported as AE. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For exa mple, an acute appendicitis that begins during the AE reporting period should be reported as the AE and the resulting appendectomy entered in the c omments section of the CRF . Serio us adverse ev ent (SAE) An AE that meets one or more of the following criteri a/outcomes is classified as serious: • Results in d eath. • Is life-threatening (i.e., at immediate risk of death) . • Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . • Results in p ersistent or significant disability/incapacity . • Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (i.e., in an offspring to the study subject) . Other medically important AE that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allerg ic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse. Serious also includes any other event that the investigator or company judges to be serious . Any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via IMP shall also be considered serious. Hospitali zation Hospitalization includes transfers within a hospital (e.g. from the hospital ward to the intensive care unit) and also includes admissions less th an 24 hours. The following situations are not considered hospitalizations (although other SAE criteria may still apply): • Outpatient procedures / ambulatory care . • Emergency department visits ."
64,page_64,"Sobi SOBI003 Clinical Study No: SOBI003 -002 Confidential Page 65 of 84 Version 1.0, Final Date 29 Jun 2018 Hospitali zation in the absence of an AE occurring during the stud y should not be considered an SAE . This includes: • Hospitalization due to a pre -existing condition not associated with a worsening of the pre-existing condition . • Protocol specified admission . • Elective admission, e.g. due to cosmetic surgery . • Pre-planned admission for a condition specified at Baseline for the patient . Treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) TEAE is any AE with onset or worsening reported from the time that the first dose of IMP is admin istered until completion of or early termination from the study. Adver se event reporting pe riod The period for recording AE, including SAEs , on the CRF begins Day 1 upon signing of the study ICF on Week 25 and ends at Day 8 of W eek 10 4 (End of Study) . This includes all events observed/diagnosed or reported since the last visit of the FIH study ( SOBI003 -001) (Week 24 / End of study). In addition, SAEs should be reported, from the time the ICF is signed until 28 days past the last dose of IMP, unless the patient will continue SOBI003 treatment in a Sobi -sponsored extension study starting in direct connection to the study, collecting these events. Eliciti ng and recording adverse event info rmation The investigator is to record all directly observed AE, and all AEs spontaneously reported by the parent/ patient , in the CRF using concise medical terminology . When possible and appropriate, a diagnosis rather than individual signs and symptoms shall be recorded. The investigator is responsible for obtaining sufficient information to determine seriousness, causality and outcome of each AE. Severity assessment For the purpose of consistency, the investigator will use the grading provided in Table 12 to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. The grading is bas ed on the NCI CTCAE (version 4.03). Table 12 Severity grade definitions according to NCI CTCAE (version 4.03) Grade I Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated Grade II Moderate; minimal, local or non -invasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADL)"
65,page_65,"Sobi SOBI003 Clinical Study No: SOBI003 -002 Confidential Page 66 of 84 Version 1.0, Final Date 29 Jun 2018 Grade III Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL Grade IV Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated Note the distinction between the seriousness (serious/non -serious) and the intensity (severity) of an AE. Severe is a measure of intensity; thus, a severe reaction is not necessarily a serious reaction. For example, a headache may be severe in intensity, but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the crit eria for serious events listed above. Causality assessment For each AE, the investigator or sub -investigator must make a causality assessment on the basis of his/her clinical judgment to determine if there is a reasonable possibility that the IMP(s) caused the AE. The AE is assessed as related or not related to the IMP(s) with the following definitions: Related The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the study product administration, and cannot be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state or other factors (e.g., disease under study, concurrent diseases, or concomitant medications). Not Related The AE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from study product administration, or can be reasonably explained by the su bject’s clinical state or other factors (e.g., disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications). Serious adverse event rep orting Both serious and non -serious AEs are to be reported on the AE page of the CRF as specified in the CRF in structions. The form for collection of SAE information is not the same as the general AE CRF page. Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same AE term should be used on both forms. Any SAE mu st be reported by the investigator if it occurs during the clinical study whether or not the SAE is considered to be related to the investigational product. An SAE report consists of the SAE form including medical history and co ncomitant medications. A cop y of these forms must be emailed or faxed within 24 hours at: • SAE reporting email address: INCDrugsafety@INCResearch.com • SAE reporting toll fax number: +1 877 464 7787 • SAE reporting country specific toll -free fax numbers In addition, to the SAE r eporting to INC, the investigator must via email notify the Sobi Medical Director and Drugsafety@sobi.com."

Best efforts s hall be made by the investigator to provide INC Research with additional information related to any SAE as requested. The investigator should not wait to receive additional information to document fully the event before notification of a SAE, though addit ional information may be requested. Where applicable, information from relevant laboratory results, hospital case records, and autopsy reports should be obtained. All new information obtained, relevant to an SAE report, should be forwarded to INC Research within the same timeframe as the initial information. Instances of death, congenital abnormality, or an event that is of such clinical concern as to influence the overall assessment of safety, if brought to the attention of the investigator at any time aft er cessation of study drug administration and linked by the investigator to this study, should be reported to the study monitor. Sobi and/or INC Research will promptly notify all relevant investigators and the regulatory authorities of findings that could adversely affect the safety of subjects, impact on the conduct of the study or alter the independent ethics committee (IEC)/institutional review board (IRB) approval/favorable opinion of the study. In addition, INC Research, on behalf of Sobi, will expedi te the reporting to all concerned investigators, to the IECs/IRBs, where required, and to the regulatory authorities of all adverse reactions that are both serious and unexpected. The expedited reporting to the regulatory authority in the U.S.A. will howev er be managed by Sobi. Follow -up of unresolved adverse ev ents All AEs should be followed until they are resolved or the investigator assesses them as chronic or stable , or the patient ’s participation in the study ends, i.e., until Day 7 of Week 10 4 (End of Study) . How to report changes in an ongoing AE during a patient 's participation in the study is described in the CRF instructions. In addition, all serious and non -serious AEs asses sed by the investigator as related to SOBI003 should continue to be followed until they resolve or until the investigator assesses them as “chronic” or “stable”, even after the patient 's participation in the study is over. 7.5.4.2 Labora tory safety asse ssments Biochemistry, hematology, coagulation and urine analyses are conducted at a central laboratory (BARC) . The time points for sample collection are summarized in Table 13 as well as the analyses performed at each sampling occasion.

Sampling details are provided separately in the Study laboratory manual. 7.5.4.4 Vital signs Vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate , body tempe rature , respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation ) are measured at each SOBI003 infusion. At Weeks 25 to 104 , vital signs are measured pre-infusion, mid- infusion and within 1 hour after end of each infusion. Vital signs are also measured at Early Termination. If the dose of SOBI003 is adjusted in a patient, vital signs are measured pre-infusion, 1, 2 and 3 hours after start of infusion, within 1 hour aft er end of infusion, within 6 -7 hours after start of infusion, within 8 -12 hours after start of infusion , 24 hours after start of infusion and 48 hours following infusion for the firs t 3 infusions . During these weeks , continuous pulse oximetry is assessed from pre -infusion until compl etion of SOBI003 infusion. Blood pressure and heart rate are measured in accord ance to each clinic´s standard procedures . When the clinical situation allows, the assessments should preferably be done in supine position after the patient has rested comfort ably for at least 5 minutes. Body temperature is measured in degrees Celsius using a tympanic thermometer according to each clinic´s standard procedures . The pulse oximetry sensor device is placed on a fingertip or earlobe (according to standard routines at the study site). In case of need to prolong infusions (i.e., > 4 hours) at any time during the study, pulse oximetry monitoring will be applied, as judged by the investigator.

At Weeks 25 to 104 , general appearance and skin at the infusion site are examined prior to start of each infusion and within 1 hour after end of infusi on. Height and h ead circumf erence are assessed at Week s 52 and 104 . Weight is assessed every 4 weeks during the treatment period in order to determine the actual SOBI003 dose to be administered ( Section 7.4.5 ). The body weight is obtained either on the day prior to the infusion or the day of infusion . Height and head circumference are recorded in centimeters and weight in kilograms. For all weight assessments, a scale with at least 100 -g accuracy should be used. Neurological examination At Weeks 52 and 104, and during Early Termination, a pediatric neurologist conducts an applicable age -related neurological examination including: • Cranial Nerves • Cerebellar function • Sensory function • Reflexes • Motor function Normal/abnormal status will be captured, and any abnormalities will be specified. 7.5.4.7 Approp riateness of mea surements The s afety assessments in this study are widely used and generally recog nized as re liable, accurate, and relevant. 7.5.4.8 Data safety monitoring b oard A DMC is assigned to monitor safety and immunogenicity data.

Blood samples are obtained through the central venous access port to characterize SOBI003 PK in serum . For the PK samples collected at the end of infusion a PK sample will a lso be collected from a peripheral v enous line , as described in more details below . A blood volume of 0. 3 mL will be collected from the central venous access port and an additional 0. 3 mL blood will be collected from the peripheral venous line , as applicable . PK blood samples will be collected before start of infusion, at the end of infusion and 168h after s tart of infus ion at W eeks 38, 52, 78 and 104 . If the dose is adjusted in a patient, PK blood samples will also be collected before, at the end of infusion and 168 h after start of the infusion for the adjusted dose. In addition, PK blood samples will be c ollected before, at the end of infusion and 168 h after start of the infusion 4 weeks and 8 weeks after adjusting the dose. A PK blood sample will also be collected before the 3rd adjusted dose, as reference for ADA (see Section 7.5.4.3 for more details ). Acceptable deviations from these planned sampling time points are the following: 4 h (end of infusion) (+0.5h), and 168 h (- 1h). Details on PK blood sampling are presented in Section 7.5.1.1. and ysummarized in Table 10. Duplicate aliquots are required for each sampling time point. Separate blo od samples from a peripheral venous line are collected in parallel for samples collected at the end of infusion in order to compare serum SOBI003 concentrations in samples collected from a peripheral line with samples from the central venous access port line, which is used also for the i .v. administration of SOBI003. The purpose of these parallel samples is to confirm that the SOBI003 i .v. infusion does not inter fere with the blood sampling. The PK samples from a peripheral venous line for the End of infusi on sample can be excluded if it has been confirmed in the FIH study (SOBI003 -001) that the SOBI003 i.v. infusion does not interfere with the PK blood sampling . In addition, at each time point a sample is collected for immunogenicity, a blood sample is obtained for determination of SOBI003 in serum. In case of a time deviation for the immunogenicity sample, the time for the PK s ample should be adjusted accordingly, or an additional PK sample may have to be collected. Therefore, in case the SOBI003 treatment is terminated prior to Week 104, then a PK and immunogenicity sample should be obtained as soon as possible after the decision of early treatment termination, as well as 30 to 40 days after the final SOBI003 infusio n. For patients with confirmed ADA levels, blood samples for PK and immunogenicity analysis should continue in accordance with Section 7.5.4.3 . CSF samples (0.5 mL) are collected during general anesthesia at Day 2 on Weeks 52 and 104 for determination of SOBI003 . Triplicate aliquots are required for each sampling time point. At the time of CSF sample collection, a blood sample will also be collect ed for determination"

In case the time point for the CSF sample is deviating from the planned time point, the blood samples should be adjusted accordingly. The exact time of the SOBI003 infusion start and completion as well as of each PK sampling are recorded in the CRF for each patient. Sampling, storage and shipment details are provided separately in the Study laboratory manual. 7.5.5.2 Bioan alytical met hod SOBI003 concentrations in serum and CSF are determined at a central laboratory (York Bioanalytical Solutions Limited, York YO26 6QR, United Kingdom) by the use of a v alidated immunoassay. The bioanalytical method may not be specific for SOBI003 and may cross - react with endogenous sulphamidase. Potential endogenous p re-dose sulphamidase conc entrations are taken into consideration in the PK analysis e.g. by subtracting these levels from post -dose SOBI003 concentrations 7.5.5.3 Non-compartmental p harmacokine tic analysis PK calculations, based on serum concentrations, are performed in Phoenix WinNonlin by means of NCA. Individual serum concentration data from each patient and the exact time points for blood sampling will be used throughout the analyses. The following multi ple-dose PK parameters will be determined for SOBI003 at Weeks 39, 52, 78 and 104 , and during dose-adjustments : • The time of the end of the infusion of SOBI003, t End of inf • The observed serum concentration at the end of infusion of SOBI003, C End of inf • The observed serum concentration immediately before the start of infusion of SOBI003, C Pre-dose • The area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to last sample, AUC 168hClearance, CL The area under the plasma concentration -time curve from time 0 to last sample, AUC 168h calculated according to the linear log trapezoidal method.

The blood sampling volume is a 0.3 mL at each sampling occasion. CSF samples (200 µL) are collected at Weeks 52 and 104 for analyses of HS. The serum and CSF HS analyses are performed at a central laboratory (York Bioanalytical Solutions Limited, York YO26 6QR, United Kingdom). Urine HS analysis is performed at another laboratory ( Greenwood Genetic Center, 106 Gregor Mendel Cir, Greenwood, South Carolina 29646, USA ). HS storage in serum and CSF is assessed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC -MS/MS). The HS polymer itself is highly heterogeneous and therefore it is not possible to analyze at the intact molecule level. Therefore, the total level of HS is measured by analyzing selected disaccharides derived from enzymatic digestion (adaptation of method described in Naimy et al. 2016 ) (20). Sampling, storage and shipment details are provided separately in the Study laboratory manual. 7.5.6.2 Future bioanalytical research As local regulations permit and provided that additional separate caregiver consent is given, blood (2 mL) and CSF (1 mL) samples are collected for future biomarker analyses at Weeks 52 and 104 . The samples will be stored at a central laboratory (York Bio analytical Solutions Limited ) for a maximum of 10 years following study completion (i.e. last patient’s last visit in this study). MPS IIIA is a very rare and sever e disease for which there is a lot of research ongoing to further increase the understandin g of disease pathology as well as diagnosis. The purpose of the sample storage is to allow future exploration/confirmation of new research findings. This includes: • Biomarkers in serum and/or CSF with possible relation to the safety, tolerability, immunoge nicity, PK and PD of SOBI003 The results of any such analyses will not be included in the Clinical Study Report for this study, but reported separately when analyzed, thus enabling exploration of any emerging novel disease -related discoveries of e.g., pre viously unknown disease alleles, inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL1Ra, TNFα, calprotectin, neopterin) , other HS biomarkers (e.g. HS metabolites), components of the complement system, and neurodegeneration (e.g., T-tau, hepatocyte growth factor, calbindin D) . Sampling details are provided separately in the Study laboratory manual. 7.5.6.3 Appropria teness of mea surements Storage of HS in brain lysosomes causes pathological changes such as neuroinflammation and inhibition of autophagy in the MPS IIIA mouse model (21).

Furthermore, the levels of HS derivatives in brain homogenate and CSF are strongly correlated, and the HS reduction at different dose level s of SOBI003 is parallele d in these two compartments. Patients with MPS IIIA have elevated CSF HS levels in CSF as compared to healthy individuals (22). Also in humans, a reduction of HS in CSF is expected to mirror the reduction in brain and thus be a useful PD tool for dose selection. 8 Quality control and quality assu rance This study will be conducted in compliance with this protocol, study specific procedures, INC Research SOPs , the ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and applicable regulatory requirements. Monitoring visits to the study site are performed periodically during the study, to help ensure compliance with the protocol, study specific procedures and applicable regulatory requirements. Source documents are reviewed for verification of agreement with data in CRFs. All patient informed consent forms are reviewed. The investigator or institution guarantee s access to source documents by Sobi, its representatives, and appropriat e regulatory agencies. The study site may be subject to a quality assurance audit by Sobi or its representatives, as well as inspection by appropriate regulatory agencies. It is important that the investigator(s) and the(ir) relevant personnel are availabl e during the monitoring visits and possible audits and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 9 Statistic al plan 9.1 Determinati on of sample si ze All patients completing the FIH study ( SOBI003 -001) will be offered to continue into this extension study a nd the number of patients in the extension study is thus not based on statistical grounds.

Therefore, assuming very high likelihood of showing significant decrease in HS (with baseline mean of 5.2, std 1.8, correlation of 0.1 and a decrea se of 80% the power is 99%), with 9 patients treated with SOBI003, the power to demonstrate an improvement in cognitive function is at least 80% if the decline is 9.8 DQ points for patients treated with SOBI003 as compared to a decline of 30.4 DQ points fo r untreated control patients (SD=13.0) and the reduction is homogeneous across age . 9.2 Definitio n of study pop ulations The following analysis sets will be used in the statistical analyses."
74,page_74,"Sobi SOBI003 Clinical Study No: SOBI003 -002 Confidential Page 75 of 84 Version 1.0, Final Date 29 Jun 2018 Safety analysis set (SAF) : The SAF will consist of all patients who received at least 1 dose of IMP. The full -analysis set (FAS) is the efficacy analysis set which will consist of all patients enrolled in this extension study, and all patients in the NH study with a rapid progressive disease having a baseline age of 12 -72 months (in the DQ analyses) . PK analysis set (PK): The PK set will consist of all patients where at least one SOBI003 dose has been administered correctly and where SOBI003 serum or CSF concentration data is available without any protocol deviation interfering with these results . Immunogenicity analysis set (IAS): The IAS will consist of those subjects in the safety analysis set who have sufficient blood samples taken for ADA testing at baseline (screening visit) and at least one post -dose time -point The SAF is used for the safety analysis, the FAS is used for the secondary and explorat ive efficacy variables . A subpopulation of the FAS patients who are up to 30 months of age and in the FIH (SOBI003 -001) study was initially assigned a dose at least as high as the dose selected for a planned phase III study will be included in future prima ry analysis population for demonstrating efficacy using c ombined data from the FIH study and the extension study, the Phase III trial and the corresponding patients in the NH study (control patients) , consisting of the 14 patients with a rapid progressive MPS IIIA disease and a baseline age of 12 to 72 months . 9.3 Estimands There will be a de facto estimand in the study, which is the primary estimand for the evaluation of efficacy. The estimand is the change in • cognitive decline in all the patients from the po pulation captured by the inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Sections 4.2.1 and Section 4.2.2) and the part of the NH population with a rapid progressive disease having a baseline age of 12 -72 months, irrespectively of other medications used and adherenc e to treatment, and estimated by a repeated measures model of the change from baseline in DQ as described in Section 14.1. • decline in HS levels in CSF in all the patients from the population captured by the inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Sections 4 .2.1 and Section 4.2.2) irrespectively of other medications used and adherence to treatment, and estimated by a repeated measures model o f the change from baseline in HS as described in Section 14.1. To address foreseeable inter -current events, such as drop -outs, all missing values will be imputed (see Section 9.4. 4) in accordance with the treatment policy principle. A sensitivity analysis will be performed where no imputations are performed, but all values are used: If a patient has a missing value in any assessment, then the same patient’s non -missing scores will be used in the repeated measures model. The repeated measures model (see Section 9.4.4 ) handles missing values based on the missing at random ( MAR ) assumption. One further sensitivity a nalysis for DQ will address this assumption based on zero imputations , the rational being that the patients not assessed are those expected to have a severe DQ decline. Other sensitivity analys es for this purpose will be tipping po int analys es."

Categorical variables are summarized using frequency counts and percentages . 9.4.4 Analysi s related to secondary obje ctive s 9.4.4.1 Key secondary endpoints at Week 104 The first key efficacy endpoint related to the first key secondary objective is the change from baseline in Development Quotient (DQ) of neurocognitive development at Week 104 after start of SOBI003 treatment in the FIH study (SOBI003 -001). Since t his is a single -arm study without an internal control group, efficacy relating to neurocogn ition will be evaluated through a comparison to an external historical control group consisting of the available natural history data within the target study population, i.e. 14 patients with a rapid progressive disease and a baseline age of 12 to 72 month s followed for 24 months (22). The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (BSID -III) or the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, Second E dition (KABC -II) will be used to assess neurodevelopment using the same approach as in the NH study (22). For each patient, an age - equivalent score ( AEq) is determined using published normat ive data for the US population . An AEq score is the average score for a particular age. The Development Q uotient is calculated as the AEq divided by the chronological age of the child multiplied with 100 , i.e. DQ = 100* AEq / Age . For patients completing an assessment of both BSID -III and KABC -II, the BSID -III score will be used as a basis for calculating the DQ of neurocognitive development at baseline. A calibration of overlapping AEq scores between BDID -III and KABC -II will be done to assess if a patient outgrows the BSID -III test during the duration of the study. If confirmed, assessments of KABC -II will fo rm the basis for calculating DQ of neurocognitive development fo r remaining study assessments. DQ of neurocognitive development will be evaluated using a repeated measures analysis with the DQ measurements at baseline, Week 52 , and Week 104 as response , and visit and visit -"

The primary efficacy analysis set will thus consist of all patients included in this extension study (patients treated with SOBI003) and 14 patients from the NH study (untreated patients). The null hypothesis of no treatment effect will be tested with a si gnificance test for the treatment*time -effect, in the second step of the multiple testing procedure (see Section 9.4.5 ) The difference between 104 weeks and baseline will be used as the contrast of interest for the test . All missing DQ values will be imput ed. For a patient who stops treatment, let tp denote the turning point, i.e. the time point when the patient stops treatment. The patient’s assessments as well as the time points for prediction are classified as being on either side of the turning point or at the turning point: prior to tp, at tp, or after tp. For patients who does not stop treatment, let tp = ∞, i.e. every time point is considered as prior to the tp. Let v denote a missing value to be imputed for a patient. The imputations will be based on two categories of predictions. 1) If the patient has two or more observations on the same side of tp as v (including a possible observation at tp), then v is considered as exclusively patient -predictable (p1), i.e. it can be predicted by simple linear r egression based only on the patient’s data (intra -or extra - polation). On the other hand, if only one or zero observations exists on the same side of tp (from the particular patient) as v (including a possible observation at tp), then it is considered as non-predictable exclusively from the patient’s data. 2) The other type of prediction ( p2), will be calculated by the use of a population derived slope, e stimated based on the repeated measures model in Section 9.4.4 (without imputations), and a patient observation. There will be two cases ; If the patient has one or more observations on the same side of tp as v (including a possible observation at tp), then the nearest observation will be used together with a slope, which is based on the population (treated or untreated) of the same status as the side of tp where the prediction time point is situated, as well as the interval relative the visits which contain the prediction time point. The other case is when there is no observation on the same side of tp as v (and no observation at tp). In this case, a prediction at tp will first be calculated, based on the same method as described above (under 2) but on the o ther side of tp, i.e. the nearest observation relative tp on the other side of tp will be used together with a slope based on the population (treated or untreated) of the same status as the side of tp where this nearest observation time point is situated, as well as the interval relative the visits which contain the tp. This prediction at the tp is in then used to predict v as described under the first case (under 2). For each missing value v, the following algorithm is used to impute v by i: If p1 does not exists, then p2 is used, i.e., i = p2. Otherwise, a weighted average will be used for the imputation: i = w 1 p1 + w 2 p2, where w1 = exp(-λln(2)/3 ) and w2 = 1 - exp(-λln(2)/3 ) and λ is the distance in months between the time point for prediction an d the nearest available non -missing patient assessment time point. The exponential function is motivated by an exponential decrease of relevance of individual patient data relative to population data with increasing time, and the coefficient ln(2)/3 is chosen such that population data reach the same weight as individual patient data after 75 % of the distance between 2 visits, i.e. 3 months. When individual patient data is available near a missed visit, the patient data weight is near 100 %, and when the di stance is near one year on the other hand, the individual patient data weight has decreased to nearly 6 %."

For the purpose of the multiple testing procedure (see Section 14.3), the linear repeated measures analysis with untransformed HS levels in CSF will be used, identical to the DQ analysis wit h the exception of the treatment factors. The time effect is used to judge the HS level change in CSF. The null hypothesis of no change will be tested with a significance test for the time -effect in the first step of the multiple tes ting procedure (see Sec tion 9.4.5 ). The difference between 104 weeks and baseline will be used as the contrast of interest for the test . Missing HS values will be imputed according to the same methodology as for the missing DQ values. 9.4.4.2 Secondary endpoints and additional key secon dary endpoints To assess the PD effect of SOBI003 on HS levels in CSF , serum and urine , linear models are used to model the change from baseline in HS levels as dependent variable, for both logged HS levels and untransformed HS levels, and baseline level a nd age as continuous covariates, and accumulated dose as covariate and sex as factor. The analyses are conducted for each assessment time point. In addition, linear analyses with HS levels, both logged HS levels and untransformed HS levels, in CSF, serum a nd urine, as dependent variable, and baseline level and age as continuous covariates, and dose and sex as factors will be performed across all assessments, with assessment as a repeated factor. Adaptive behavior will be analyzed with the same repeated meas ures model as DQ, but adapted for one group (i.e. no treatment*visit interaction term), the SOBI003 group. PK results are presented by dose level using descriptive statistics . In addition, results are presented by demographic characteristics, e.g., age -group and bodyweight, as applicable. Immunogenicity is summarized using frequency counts and percentages by dose level. To assess the PD effect of SOBI003 on MRI, linear models are used to model the c hange from baseline in MRI as dependent var iable, for both logged MRI and untransformed MRI , and baseline level and age as continuous covariates, and accumulated dose (including the FIH study) as covariate and sex as factor . The analyses are conducted for each assessment time point i.e. Weeks 52 and 104. In addition, linear analyses with MRI levels, both logged MRI levels and untransformed MRI levels , as dependent variable, and baseline level and age as continuous covariates, and accumulated dose as covariate and sex as factor will be performed across all assessments (including the FIH study) , with assessment as a repeated factor. Endpoints relating to the neurocognition, adaptive behavior, liver and spleen volume, QoL, language, motor function and sleep pattern are summarized using descriptive statistics. 9.4.5 Multiple comparison procedure A hierarchical approach w ill be used for the key secondary co-endpoints ."

A stepwise sequenti al testing procedure will be used to ensure a multiple level of significance of 0.05. • 1st step: The null hypothesis of no difference between the treatments with respect to the reduction from baseline HS in CSF at 24 months will be tested using a significa nce level of 0.05. If the null hypothesis is rejected , then it will be concluded that SOBI 003 reduces HS. Furthermore, the 2nd step of the sequential testing procedure will be performed. • 2nd step: The null hypothesis of no difference between the treatments with respect to the change in DQ score at 24 months will be tested using a significance level of 0.05. If the null hypothesis is rejected , it will be concluded that SOBI 003 improves cognitive function as compared to untreated patients. This multiple comp arison procedure controls that the multiple level of significance is no more than 5%.
