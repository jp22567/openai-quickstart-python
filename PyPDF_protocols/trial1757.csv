Test background Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most harmful cardiovascular disease worldwide. It is also the first cause of ho spitalization and death of adult heart disease in China. Its morbidity and mortality are still on the rise. Active treatment and prevention of CHD is an important subject in medical research. Coronary heart disease angina pectoris is a kind of heart disease caused by myocardial ischemia and anoxia caused by coronary atherosclerosis. It belongs to the category of ""chest obstruction"" and ""heartache"" in traditional Chinese medicine. The occurrence of angina pectoris is mostly related to cold pat hogenic invasion, improper diet, emotional disorder, old body deficiency and other factors. The pathogenesis of ""Chest Bi"" is deficiency and reality, which is actually cold coagulation, Qi stagnation, blood stasis, phlegm obstruction, obstruction of chest Yang and heart vein; deficiency is deficiency of heart, spleen, liver and kidney, heart and vein dystrophy. One of its common pathogenesis is stagnation of Qi and blood stasis, blockage of blood vessels, so it should be treated by activating blood circulat ion and removing blood stasis, dredging channels and collaterals, as well as tranquilizing Qi and tranquilizing spirit, in order to achieve the goal of blood stasis to remove new life and nourish the blood vessels of viscera and viscera. Xinnao ning Capsule (Z20025697), produced by Guizhou Jingcheng Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., is mainly composed of Ginkgo biloba leaves, Salvia miltiorrhiza, Ginger fruit, Euonymus microphylla and Allium macrophylla. It has the functions of activating blood circulati on, promoting Qi circulation, dredging collaterals and relieving pain. Chest stuffiness, dizziness, vertigo, symptoms: chest tightness, tingling, palpitation restlessness, dizziness and dizziness, as well as coronary heart disease, cerebral arteriosclerosi s see the above symptoms. Xinnaoning Capsule has not had any adverse reactions for many years after it was put on the market. Pharmacological research Xinnaoning Capsule, in which Ginkgo biloba leaf is the monarch medicine, Ginkgo biloba leaf promotes bloo d circulation and removes blood stasis, relieves pain, is used for coronary heart disease, angina pectoris and blood stasis syndrome caused by hyperlipidemia. Salvia miltiorrhiza and Ginger fruit are the main medicines. Among them, Salvia miltiorrhiza has good effect on promoting blood circulation and removing blood stasis, cooling blood and tranquilizing mind, and has good effect on all diseases caused by blood stasis, especially on heart and brain blood stasis"
13,page_13,"Clinical trial scheme of Xinnaoning capsule Programme number ：DHZD -XNNJN -001 Version number ：V1.1 Version date ：January 26，2018 syndrome. In addition, Salvia miltiorrhiza ca n cool blood and calm the nerves. It has good effect on palpitation and insomnia in the above diseases. Ginger has the function of dispelling cold in warmth, regulating qi and relieving pain. The combination of the two medicines can not only promote blood circulation, but also regulate qi. Qixing can promote blood circulation and remove blood stasis. Populus microphylla and Allium macrophylla were used as adjuvants. Effectiveness of Euonymus microphylla is promoting qi and blood circulation, dredging collat erals and relieving pain. It is used for chest pain, heart pain and coronary heart disease caused by qi stagnation and blood stasis. The effect of Xiebai can regulate qi, broaden chest, promote Yang and disperse. It is used to treat thoracic paralysis and heartache. ""Compendium of Materia Medica"" says that it can ""treat Shaoyin disease, syncope, diarrhea, and chest pain. These two medicines have the functions of regulating qi, promoting blood circulation and strengthening the functions of activating blood c irculation, regulating qi and stasis of other medicines. The above medicines are mainly used to promote blood circulation, supplemented by regulating qi. Regulating Qi helps to promote blood circulation. Promoting blood circulation helps to promote qi circ ulation, blood stasis, meridians and collaterals, and all kinds of symptoms go by themselves to treat chest pain, stroke, stroke, dizziness and other diseases caused by qi stagnation and blood stasis, blockage of blood vessels. Modern pharmacol ogy shows that flavonoids and terpene lactones are effective components of Ginkgo biloba leaves. Experiments show that flavonoids and terpene lactones are beneficial to blood vessel and brain metabolism and inhibit platelet activating factor. Ginkgolides a nd ginkgolides can significantly improve the oxygen tolerance of brain cells and enhance local brain flow. Ginkgolides have a strong neuroprotective effect. Salvia miltiorrhiza can inhibit platelet aggregation, dilate coronary artery, increase the opening of collateral circulation, improve myocardial hypoxia, and also have good scavenging effect of oxygen free radicals. The experiment of Gingeria officinalis L. showed that Gingeria officinalis L. oil could reduce the area of myocardial infarction and the le vel of serum lactate dehydrogenase after myocardial infarction. It has protective effect on myocardial ischemia. It can also slow down the systolic and diastolic blood pressure, slow down the heart rate and reduce the cardiac output. Allium sibiricum can i nhibit platelet aggregation and reduce serum lipid peroxide and blood lipid. Euonymus microphylla can dilate coronary artery, improve myocardial ischemia and reduce oxygen consumption. Previous clinical trials 1.

Evaluation of Xinnaoning Capsule in the Treatment of Angina Pectoris after Coronary Stent Implantation From June 2012 to June 2014, the cardiovascular disease center of Xiyuan Hospital, Chinese Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine was studied. Me thods: 160 patients with recurrent angina pectoris after coronary artery stent implantation were randomly divided into treatment group (80 cases) and control group (80 cases). The course of treatment was 8 weeks. Control group: aspirin enteric -coated table ts 100mg, once a day, isosorbide mononitrate tablets 20mg, twice a day, atorvastatin calcium tablets 20mg, once a day. Treatment group: On the basis of the control group, Xinnaoning capsule was added, three capsules each time, three times a day. The result s are as follows: Table 4 Comparison of curative effect of angina pectoris between two groups (%) Group ME effective invalid TER T 28（35.00） 41（51.25） 11（13.75） 69（86.25） C 19（23.75） 30（37.50） 31（38.75） 49（61.25） Note: Compared with the control group, P＜0.05 Table 5 Comparison of curative effect of TCM syndromes between two groups (%) Group Chest pain ME effective invalid TER Test（n=80） 26（32.50） 45（56.25） 9 （11.25） 71（88.75） Control（n=80） 19 （23.75） 32（40.00） 29（36.25） 51（63.75） Group Chest tightness ME effective invalid TER Test（n=80） 26（32.50） 46（57.50） 8 （10.00） 72（90.00） Control（n=80） 28（22.50） 35（43.75） 27（33.75） 53（66.25） Group pant ME effective invalid TER Test（n=80） 24（32.50） 48（60.00） 8 （10.00） 72（90.00） Control（n=80） 18（22.50） 34（42.50） 28（35.00） 52（65.00）"

There were no significant changes in ECG, blood pressure and heart rat e before and after treatment, and no obvious adverse reactions during treatment, suggesting that the drug is safe. For many years after Xinnaoning capsule was put on the market, no adverse reactions were recorded in the literature. This experim ent completes the clinical trial of Xinnaoning Capsule in treating chronic stable angina pectoris (Qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome), and objectively evaluates its clinical efficacy and safety. 2. Experimental purpose To evaluate the efficacy and sa fety of Xinnaoning Capsule in the treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris (Qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome) 3. Experimental design 3.1 Integral test design The design adopted a placebo parallel control, randomized, double -blind, multi -center cl inical research design method. (1) Multi -center: This multi -center clinical study is expected to be carri ed out in Beijing, Shanghai, Sh anxi and Tianjin. (2) Random: block random method. SAS 9.1.3 statistical software was used to generate random number grouping table according to the number of cases allocated and random proportion of participating units.

(4) Control: placebo control. The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of Xinnaoning Capsule in the treatment of stable angina pectoris, which can reflect its ""absolute"" efficacy and safety, so the placebo control is used in this trial. For well -executed clinical trials, placebo -controlled trials can reliably prove the efficacy of research drugs, unlike non -inferiority design trials, which need to introduce the hypothesis of external efficacy sensitivity and test sensitivity; secondly, placebo -controlled clinical trials can clearly study the absolute efficacy of drugs; thirdly, they can better differentiate between non -inferiority design tri als. Good events are caused by drugs or by some potential diseases or other factors; fourthly, they are more efficient and require a smaller number of subjects than any other parallel controlled study; fifthly, they can reduce the degree of disease improve ment expected by the subjects and clinical researchers, and increase the ability to detect and study the true efficacy of drugs. All subjects in this study received basic treatment routinely. Placebo use did not affect the normal treatment of s ubjects, which met the ethical requirements. In the experiment, remedial measures such as nitroglycerin (uniformly provided by the applicant) will be given after the attack of angina pectoris. Diary cards and exercise manual of coronary heart disease will be issued during the clinical trial. Researchers should strengthen the observation of the number of attacks of angina pectoris and the dosage of nitroglycerin. The rights and interests of the subjects will be guaranteed and meet the ethical requirements. Usage: When angina pectoris patients attack, take one tablet under the tongue, and repeat one tablet every 5 minutes until the pain relieves. If the pain persisted after a total of 3 tablets in 5 minutes, the subjects were immediately treated. (5) Sample size: 120 cases in the experimental group and 120 cases in the control group. 3.2 Sample size According to the statistical requirements, the sample size was estimated. The main effect index was the curative effect of angina pectoris symptoms treated for 12 weeks. According to the literature, the total effective rate of basic treatment plus placebo was 67.5%, and the"

Subject selection and wit hdrawal 4.1 Diagnostic criteria of Western Medicine 4.1.1 Diagnostic criteria for coronary heart disease Referring to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Stable Angina issued by the Chinese Medical Association in 2007, the Diagnosis of Stable Ischemic Heart Disease by 2012ACP/ACCF/AHA/AATS/PCNA/STS: Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the Guidelines for the Management of Stable Coronary Artery Diseases issued by 2013 ESC, we can diagnose coronary heart disease by conforming to any of the following: (1) There is a clear history of old myocardial infarction, PCI or bypass. (2) Coronary angiography (results indicate that at least one coronary artery is stenosed and the lumen is stenosed more than 50%) or coronary CTA indicates th at the lumen is stenosed more than 50%. 4.1.2 Diagnostic criteria for angina pectoris Referring to the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Stable Angina Pectoris issued by the Editorial Board of the Chinese Journal of Cardiovascular Disea ses in 2007, the Society of Cardiovascular Diseases of the Chinese Medical Association: When physical activity or mental stress occurs, coronary artery blood flow can not meet the needs of myocardial metabolism, leading to angina attack induced by myocardial ischemia. Resting or taking nitroglycerin can alleviate it. Chronic stable angina pectoris refers to the degree, frequency, nature and inducing factors of angina"
19,page_19,"Clinical trial scheme of Xinnaoning capsule Programme number ：DHZD -XNNJN -001 Version number ：V1.1 Version date ：January 26，2018 pectoris attacks in 1 to 3 months without significant changes in subjects. Referring to the International Heart Association and WHO Joint Thematic Group on Standardization of Clinical Nomenclature, ""Criteria for Nomenclature and Diagnosis of Ischemic Heart Disease"" [2]. Tired angina pectoris: Tired angina pec toris is characterized by a brief onset of chest pain induced by exercise or other conditions that increase myocardial oxygen demand. After rest or sublingual administration of nitroglycerin, the pain often disappears rapidly. There are three types of fati gue angina pectoris: First-onset fatigue angina pectoris: the course of the disease is less than one month. Stable fatigue angina pectoris: the course of the disease is stable for more than one month. Deteriorating fatigue angina pectoris: The number, severity and duration of fatigue induced by the same degree of fatigue suddenly increased. Spontaneous angina pectoris: The characteristic of spontaneous angina pectoris is that there is no significant relationship be tween chest pain attack and the increase of myocardial oxygen demand. Compared with fatigue angina pectoris, the pain generally lasts longer and is more severe, and is not alleviated by nitroglycerin. There was no change of enzymes in this type. There were some temporary S -T segment depression or T wave changes in ECG. Spontaneous angina pectoris can occur alone or in combination with fatigue angina pectoris. The frequency, duration and degree of pain in subjects with spontaneous angina pectoris may have different clinical manifestations. Sometimes the subjects may have sustained chest pain attacks, similar to myocardial infarction, but without characteristic changes of electrocardiogram and enzymes. Temporary S -T elevation occurs in some subject s with spontaneous angina pectoris, often referred to as variant angina pectoris. However, this name cannot be used when the ECG pattern is recorded in the early stage of myocardial infarction. Initial fatigue angina pectoris, worsening fatigue angina pectoris and spontaneous angina pectoris are collectively referred to as ""unstable angina pectoris"". 4.1.3 Classification criteria for angina pectoris Reference to Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Angina Severity Classification [4] Standard。 Ⅰ：General physical activity does not cause angina pectoris, such as walking and going upstairs, but tension, rapid or sustained exertion can cause the onset of angina pectoris."
20,page_20,"Clinical trial scheme of Xinnaoning capsule Programme number ：DHZD -XNNJN -001 Version number ：V1.1 Version date ：January 26，2018 Ⅱ：Daily physical activity is slightly restricted. Walking fast or upstairs, climbing high, walking after meals or upstairs, walking in cold or wind, and emotional excitement can cause angina or only occur within a few hours after waking up. It is limited to walk more than 200 meters or climb stairs above one floor at normal speed. Ⅲ：Daily physical activity is obviously limited, and angina pectoris can occur when walking 100 -200 m at normal speed or climbing a staircase. Ⅳ：Angina symptoms can occur when you are slightly active or at rest. This table is cited from the guidelines for t he management of chronic stable angina pectoris (ACC/AHA/ACP -ASIM, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/American College of Internal Medicine and American Medical Association). 4.2. Differentiation Standard of Tradition al Chinese Medicine According to the prescription composition and function of Xinnaoning Capsule, and referring to the Guiding Principles for Clinical Research of Coronary Heart Disease and Angina Pectoris Treated with Chinese Medicine and Natural Medicine in 2011, the syndrome differentiation and diagnosis criteria of Angina Pectoris with Qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome were drawn up : Diagnostic criteria of chest arthralgia in traditional Chinese medicine ①Chest pain, even chest pain thoroughly back chest pain, even chest pain thoroughly back ； ②The lighter ones only feel chest tightness, suffocation and breathlessness. ； Qi stagnation and blood stasis syndrome ： Main symptoms: chest pain, chest tightness Secondary symptoms: chest swelling, pal pitation, shortness of breath, purple lips, fatigue, dizziness, dark purple veins at the bottom of the tongue, irritability. Tongue image: dark tongue. Pulse: astringent. One of the main symptoms, two of the secondary symptoms and supporters of tongue and vein can be diagnosed."

The test drugs and the control drugs are packed in the same package. Each large package contains three boxes. The package contains Xinnaoning capsule or Xinnaoning capsule placebo. Each package contains 28 + 4 days of dosage. The drug was packed independently during the introduction period, and the dosage of 14 + 2 days was included in the package. The contents of the label include batch approval number, drug number, drug name, function, taking method, st orage condition, drug supplier, etc., and the words ""for clinical research only"". 5.4 Case allocation method Randomization method was adopted, which was carried out according to the center. With the help of SAS 9.1.3 statistical software, the random arrang ement (i.e. random coding table) of the treatment (test drug and control drug) received by 240 subjects was generated. According to the randomly determined drug number allocated by each hospital, each center allocates continuously coded drugs connected wit h each other. Random numbers are sealed in opaque envelopes and centralized managed by test centers. Each center screens patients, and qualified persons are selected. Drug administrators distribute drugs one by one according to the order of eac h subject's visiting and drug number from small to large. Subjects were asked to take the remnant drugs back when prescribed visiting points were prescribed. Drug administrators should fill in the ""test drug distribution and recovery record form"" in time. 5.5 Dose selection and administration time In this experiment, all subjects were given a uniform fixed dose, which remained unchanged during the experiment, i.e. during the experiment, the dosage should not be adjusted or the mode of administration should not be changed. If the adverse events necessarily changed or other reasons caused changes, detailed records and treatment according to excluded cases were made. 5.6 Blind method A double blind design was used in this study. (1) Generation of pr ocessing codes Randomization method was used. They are carried out according to the center.

(2) Drug preparation Firstly, random sampling of the drugs prepared by the applicant (test drugs and control drugs) is conducted to provide the corresponding drug inspection report. Secondly, the bid ders will package the drugs according to the requirements of drug packaging. (3) Preparing for Emergency Letters 1) Emergency letters, drug numbers and blindness regulations of Xinnaoning Capsule in the clinical study of chronic sta ble angina pectoris are printed on the sealed opaque envelope. If it is disassembled, it is necessary to specify the disassembler, the date of disassembly, the reason and so on, and record it in the case report form. 2) The envelope contains t he information of the patient's medication and the address of the unit and the address that should be reported immediately. After the preparation of the emergency letter, it will be sent to the centers along with the drugs, which will be recovered after th e study. (4) Packaging and numbering of drugs according to processing codes Personnel unrelated to clinical observation, surveillance and statistical analysis of this clinical study will attach the corresponding drug number to the co nspicuous position of the external packaging of the drug according to the established processing code. (5) Processing Blind Records of Coding and Drug Packing The whole drug coding process is written into a document form by the blin d person, that is, a blind record, which is kept as one of the documents of the clinical research. Its contents include: preparation of bidders'medicines, packaging, usage, storage requirements, methods of drug distribution, generation of random processing codes, packaging of medicines according to each subject, emergency letters, inspection reports of test drugs and control drugs, preservation of blind bases, provisions for eliminating blindness and distribution of the number of medicines in each center, e tc. (6) Distribution of packaged drugs Emergency letters with separate packages of research drugs and corresponding drug numbers are sent to the research centers according to random central numbers. (7) Blind bottom pres ervation All the blind bases formed by coding, together with the initial values of random numbers and the length of blocks, are sealed and handed over to the drug clinical research institutes and bidders of Xiyuan Hospital, Chinese Academy of M edical"

During the research period, the blind bases are not to be dismantled. The study will be considered invalid if any non-prescribed blind bottom leak occurs and affects the objectivity of the results of the study. (8) Blind Audit and Disclosure Provisions Blind auditing refers to checking and evaluating the data of the database after the last medical record report form is input into the database until the first blindness is uncover ed. When all the case reports are entered in two copies and checked correctly, the data manager writes out the database inspection report, which includes the completion of the study (including the list of dropped subjects), selection/exclusion criteria, integrity check, logical consistency check, outlier data check, time window check, combined drug use check, adverse event check and so on. At the blind auditing meeting, the main researchers, bidders, supervisors, data managers and bi ostatistics professionals will examine the subjects'signing of informed consent, the situation of maintaining the blindness in the research process and the emergency situation of eliminating the blindness in the research process, and make decisions on the issues raised in the database inspection report, and write the blind auditing report. The database will be locked at the same time. After data locking, the first blindness was uncovered by the staff who kept the blind bottom. This blindness unc overing only listed the group code of each subject (such as the experimental group or the control group). It was input to the computer by the statistic analyst and linked to the data file for statistical analysis. When the statistical analysis is finished, the statistical analysis report is written. At the summary meeting, the second blindness was uncovered. This blindness uncovering marked the actual corresponding groups of A and control group (such as experimental group or control group). (9) Regulations on Emergency Disclosure of Blindness When an emergency (such as a serious adverse event) occurs or the patient needs to know what kind of treatment the patient receives, the researcher immediately notifies the main researcher, urgen tly opens the emergency letter, and promptly notifies the head of the base and the inspector of the unit. Once the emergency letter is opened, the numbered subjects will withdraw from the study. Researchers should record the causes in the case report form, and record the time, place and cause of emergency blindness on the emergency letter. At least two people should sign it. At the end of the study, the case report forms were retrieved together for blind review after the study."

Observation of adverse events 7.1 Recording of adverse events In the research case history and case report fo rm, ""adverse event record form"" is set up, which requires researchers to fill in the occurrence time, severity, duration, measures taken and outcome of adverse events truthfully. The relationship between adverse events and experimental drugs was also judge d. 7.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event (AE) It refers to adverse medical events that occur during a clinical trial when a subject receives a drug, but it does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. Specifically, it includes the follow ing: suspicious adverse drug reactions, such as central nervous system, digestive system, hematopoietic system, rash, pruritus and other toxic and side effects; all reactions due to drug overdose, abuse, withdrawal, allergy or toxicity; apparently unrelate d diseases, including the aggravation of pre-existing diseases; abnormal biochemical indicators of liver and kidney function. Abnormalities found by physical examination or physical examination and requiring clinical treatment or further examination (unlik e repeated validation tests), etc. Abnormalities found in laboratory tests require clinical treatment or further investigation (unlike repetitive validation tests). If these abnormalities are related to reported events (e.g. elevated transaminase levels in jaundiced subjects), they should be described in the notes to the clinical event report and not included as a separate adverse event. 7.1.2 Judgment of Causality between Adverse Events and Testing Drugs In the event of adverse events, the researcher decid es the diagnosis and treatment measures based on the condition of the patient and whether to discontinue the observation. In case of serious adverse events, the unit undertaking clinical research should take necessary measures immediately to protect the sa fety of the subjects. If the duration of the trial is more than 4 weeks, the subjects will quit because of the aggravation of the illness (increased number of attacks, prolonged duration of attacks, increased degree of pain, increased dosage of nitroglycer in or increased level of attacks). Such cases need to be included in PPS statistics as non -curative cases. Researchers should record the relevant information in detail on the medical records of scientific research. Criteria for grading the seve rity of adverse events Mild: Usually temporary and does not affect normal daily activities. Moderate: quite uncomfortable, can affect normal daily activities. Severity: unable to carry out normal daily activities."

Item 3: Whether the suspected adverse reactions can be explained by the patient's pathological condition, combination of medication, thera py or previous therapy; Item 4: Does the suspicious adverse reaction decrease or disappear after withdrawal or dose reduction? Item 5: Does the same reaction reappear after the suspicious drug is used again? Causality cr iteria: according to the above five judgment indicators to determine the order.

While observing the curative effect, we should pay close attention to adverse events or unexpected side effects (including symptoms, signs, laboratory tests), analyze the causes, make judgments, and follow up observation and record. For adverse events during the trial, the researchers should record the occurrence time, symptoms, degree, duration, treatment measures and outcome in the case report form, judge the correlation between the adverse events and the test drugs, sign and date them. 7.1.4 Treatment of subjects with adverse events When adverse events occur, researchers can decide on the measures to be taken according to their condition. Generally, the following methods are adopted: (1) observation without discontinuing the drug test; (2) observation and discontinuation of the drug test without remedial treatment; (3) discontinuation of the drug test with remedial treatment. All adverse events should be tracked and investigated, and the treatment process and results should be recorded in detail until the subjects are properly resolved or the condition is stable. Those with abnormal laboratory indicators should be tracked back to normal or pre -medication level. According to the severity of adverse events, follow-up methods can be used to select hospitalization, outpatient service, home visits, telephone and other forms. 7.2 Dealing with Serious Adverse Events 7.2.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Event Serious adverse events refer to the following adverse events occurring at any dose of the test drug or at any time during the observation period, including the need for hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization time, disability, impairment of working ability, life -threatening or death -threatening events. 7.2.2 Trea tment and Report of Serious Adverse Events If serious adverse events occur in the trial, the unit undertaking the clinical trial shall take necessary measures immediately to protect the safety of the subjects, and report to the local provincial drug superv ision and administration department, the State Food and Drug Administration, the applicant and the ethical committee of the"

All processes need to be documented. (2) Data input and modification Data entry and management reasons are the responsibility of data managers in statistical units. Two data managers independently enter and proofread two copies. Questions on the case report form. Data managers will fill in the Question Answer Form (DRO) and send inquiries to researchers through clinical monit ors. Researchers should answer and return the questions as soon as possible. Data managers modify the data according to the researchers'answers, confirm and input them, and then issue DRO again if necessary. (3) Locking of database After blindly checking and confirming the correctness of the database, the main researchers, bidders and statisticians lock the database. If the problem is found after database locking, it can be corrected in the process of statistical analysis after confi rmation, and recorded and explained. (4) blindness elimination After all the research data are checked and locked, the first blindness detection is carried out, and then the statistical analysis is carried out according to the statis tical plan, the statistical analysis report is written, and finally the second blindness detection is carried out. 10. statistical analysis 10.1 Analytical Data Set (1) Full Analysis Set (FAS): refers to the ideal set of subjects as close as possible to th e principle of intentional analysis. The data set is derived from all randomized participants by eliminating the participants with the least and reasonable method. (2) PPS : It is a subset of the total analysis set. These subjects are more compl iant with the scheme. Compliance includes the following considerations, such as the treatment they received, the absence of major efficacy indicators, and the absence of major violations of the research scheme."

Subjects who received at least one treatment after randomization were included in the safety analysis set. 10.2 Statistical analysis method 10.2.1 Statistical d escription (1) whether it conforms to normal distribution: modifying statistical methods or transforming data when it does not conform; (2) Whether there is outlier value or not: make statistical and professional analysis to decide whether to c hoose or not; (3) Processing the missing value of the main therapeutic index data: When the main therapeutic effect data of individual subjects are missing, the way to fill the missing data is determined from the statistical and professional po int of view. For missing cases, the data were transferred from the previous measurements; for missing data, the measurements were made only once, and the mean of all the data was used to fill in the missing data. (4) The proportion of exfoliate d cases: generally not more than 20%, otherwise it should be analyzed and explained; (5) Descriptive statistical analysis: calculating mean, standard deviation, confidence interval, maximum, minimum, median, frequency (constituent ratio), etc. 10.2.2 Statistical expression (1) The report is mainly expressed in tables, which are self -evident, i.e. with headings, annotations and examples. (2) The results of repeated measurements can be expressed in tables or statistical charts to incr ease readability. (3) Bilateral tests are used in statistical tests. Those whose P is less than or equal to 0.05 will be considered as having statistical significance. 10.2.3 Statistical analysis content (1) CDAS3.0 statistical software will b e used for statistical analysis. (2) The main therapeutic data set was FAS analysis population, and the therapeutic PPS population was also analyzed. (3) Except for the superiority test of the main therapeutic indicators, all other statistical tests are carried out by bilateral test, and the difference of P value less than or equal to 0.05 will be considered statistically significant."

Compared with the baseline values at the time of admission, paired t -test was used to compare the differences between before and after admission. Variance analysis was used to compare the changes before and after treatment in eac h group. (5) Frequency (constituent ratio) was used to describe the counting data of each visit in different treatment groups. 2 test or non -parametric test were used to test the changes before and after treatment in each group. (6) Comparability analysis: Comparing demographic data and other basic value indicators to measure the comparability between the two groups. (7) Compliance analysis: Compare the two groups of patients whether to use the research drugs on time and in quantity, not using the drugs prohibited in the program. (8) Abscission analysis: _2 test will be used to compare the total abscission rate and the abscission rate due to adverse events in each group. (9) Equilibrium analysis of basic values: using variance analysis or 2 test to compare demographic data and other basic value indicators to measure the two groups of equilibrium. (10) Effectiveness analysis: PPS and FAS were used to analyze the main indicators and global indicators, and CMH test considering the central effect was used to analyze the efficacy of the two groups. The main effect indicators were selected to treat 12 weeks of angina symptoms, and the placebo was used as the control for statistical test. (11) Analysis of factors affecting efficacy: If there are significant correlative factors affecting efficacy, these factors should be considered as covariance analysis or logistic regression analysis when comparing the efficacy of the two groups. Deta iled list of combined medication is required. (12) Safety analysis: 2 test was used to compare the incidence of adverse events in the two groups, and list the adverse events in the study; analysis of the normal/abnormal changes of laboratory re sults before and after the study and the relationship between abnormal changes and research drugs. 11. Quality Control and Guarantee of Clinical Trials 11.1 Records of clinical trials Researchers should fill in all cases according to the design requirement s of the ""case report form"" one by one. Research medical records and case report forms shall be used as original records and shall not be changed. When making any corrections,"
42,page_42,"Clinical trial scheme of Xinnaoning capsule Programme number ：DHZD -XNNJN -001 Version number ：V1.1 Version date ：January 26，2018 the original record shall not be blackened. Only a horizontal line can be drawn at the amendment and the reasons can be explained by adding a description. The physician participating in the clinical trial shall sign and date it. Laboratory data in clinical trials should be recorded, and original reports (or copies) should be glued to the medical records of the study. Data that are significantly higher or beyond clinical acceptability should be verified and explained by the physician participating in the clinical trial. All medical records and case reports should be filled in with black or blue -black signature pens. Ball pens, pens or pencils are prohibited. 11.2 Management of experimental drug use All drugs should be kept in the scientific pharmacy of the hospital and designated special persons to be responsible for the preservation, distribution, recovery and return of the drugs. For the cases of withdrawal and missing visits, the experimental drugs should be recovered. At the same time, we should establish the Record of Use of Drugs in Clinical Trials, which inc ludes the date of issuance of drugs, the names of subjects, the number of drugs issued, the date of recovery, the number of drugs recovered, the signature of the dispenser and the signature of the drug collector. 11.3 Training Researchers Before the start of clinical trials, the personnel participating in clinical trials should be trained in a unified way so that researchers can fully understand the specific connotations of the clinical trial program and its indicators; the quantification criteria of sympt oms and signs are basically the same; the description of conscious symptoms should be objective, and should not be induced or prompted; and the prescribed objective indicators should be carried out according to the time points and methods prescribed by the program. Check; Familiar with the recording methods of case history and CRF; pay attention to observe adverse reactions or unexpected side effects, and follow up observation. 11.4 Measures to Improve Observation Consistency 1) Qualification examination of researchers participating in clinical trials: They must have the professional expertise, qualification and ability of clinical trials. After qualification examination, they are determined and the personnel requirements are relatively fixed. 2) Researchers should verify significant deviations or data beyond acceptable limits and make necessary explanations by the researcher."
43,page_43,"Clinical trial scheme of Xinnaoning capsule Programme number ：DHZD -XNNJN -001 Version number ：V1.1 Version date ：January 26，2018 3) Each test item must indicate the unit of measurement used. 4) Each clinical research unit shoul d appoint a special person to regularly check the progress of clinical trials and carefully verify the data and records. 5) If necessary, the bidding unit will organize a mid -term clinical meeting to check the previous work, analyze the problem s found in the clinical trial process and put forward the rectification. 11.5 Laboratory Quality Control Requirements Standard operating procedures and quality control procedures should be established in laboratories. When the main indicators may be subje ctively affected, a consistency test is needed. Each testing unit shall provide ""normal range of laboratory inspection"" for its own unit. If there is any change in the test, additional explanation should be provided in time. Effective measures should be taken to correct the differences in the results of laboratory tests or the range of normal reference values. 11.6 Surveillance of clinical trials Qualified inspectors appointed by the applicants will regularly visit the test centers during the t rial period to ensure that the rights and interests of the subjects in the clinical trials are guaranteed, that the data recorded and reported in the trials are accurate and complete, and that the trials follow the approved programs, drug clinical trial ma nagement norms and relevant regulations. The inspector is required to have direct access to source documents (original documents, data and records). Direct contact includes allowing examination, analysis, and verification of important records a nd reports for any evaluation of clinical trials. Researchers should be able to contact the Ombudsman by telephone at any time for discussion. 12. Ethical principles Before the clinical trial is officially started, it must be discussed, revise d and signed by the researcher and the applicant (i.e. this scheme), which can be submitted to the Ethics Committee for approval before the trial can be started. If problems arise in the actual implementation of clinical trials and need to be revised, plea se submit to the applicants that, after consultation and discussion by the multi -center coordinating committee, the responsible unit of clinical trials should revise the scheme and submit it it in writing to the applicants and the experimental units for si gnature and approval, and then to the Ethics Committee for approval; if it is found that the drug used in the trial is involved, it should be carried out after approval by the ethics committee."

Before the start of a clinical trial, researchers must provide the subjects with detailed information about the nature of the trial, the purpose of the trial, the potential benefits and risks, alternative therapies available, and the rights and obligations of the subjects in line with the Helsinki Declaration, so that the subjects can fully understand and consent and sign the informed consent. Bed test. Every su bject should leave detailed contact address, telephone, identity certificate and other information. At the same time, the doctor should leave his own contact telephone to the subject so that the subject can find the doctor whenever the condition changes. T his is also conducive to the doctor to keep abreast of the change of the condition, reminding the subject to return to the doctor in time to avoid missing the visit. 13. Data preservation Researchers must keep the original data of each subject, including a ll medical records and visiting records (including demographic and medical information, laboratory data, electrocardiogram, other examination or evaluation results), and a signed consent form. Case report forms are written in carbon -free duplic ate triple format. After data entry is completed, the applicants, clinical trial units and responsible units of clinical trials are filed separately. All test data must be kept for 5 years after the end of the test. If required by existing regu lations or agreements with bidders, such information should be kept for a longer period of time. The applicant or his agent will notify the researcher in writing of the deadline when the information no longer needs to be kept. If the research unit adjusts the location of the documents, the researcher shall notify the applicant or his agent in writing. 14. Modification of the scheme After approval by the ethics committee, if there are significant changes in the implementation process, the main researchers i n charge of clinical trials will write the ""revised instructions"" and sign them. At the same time, they need to report to the Ethics Committee for approval before they can be implemented. If no principled modification is made, the principal investigators, statisticians and bidders of the responsible unit of clinical trial shall discuss and decide together, and notify other participating units. 15.

Clinicians will tell patients what activities shoul d be carried out, how to master the amount of exercise and matters needing attention. The following will introduce the specific content of exercise methods for coronary heart disease subjects. 1. When can coronary heart disease subjects exercis e? 1) Normal blood pressure and pulse can be used for exercise. 2) Exercise after noon is better: Angina pectoris, myocardial infarction and sudden death often occur from 5 am to 11 noon due to high tension of coronary artery in the morning and morning. The most suitable time for subjects with coronary heart disease is 7 -9 pm. If some people are used to exercise in the morning, they should drink a large glass of water on an empty stomach before exercise. 3) Controlling th e amount of motion; 4) No competitive sports activities; 5) Step by step and persevere; 6) inappropriate activities before and after meals: in principle, no exercise within 2 hours after meals, no meals or strong tea wit hin 1 hour after exercise; 7) Don't take a bath immediately after exercise. 8) Prepare and relax before exercise; 9) Be in a good mood; 10) Avoid direct sunlight and windward exercise; 2. When can coronary heart disease subjects not exercise? 1) In quiet conditions, angina attacks often occur, and all kinds of coronary heart disease can not be controlled by treatment. 2) mild activity, i.e. palpitation, shortness of breath, wheezing or accompanied by cardiac insufficiency; 3) those who have serious arrhythmia, tachycardia, bradycardia, atrioventricular block and can not be controlled by medication; 4) Acute infection subjects; 5) accompanie d by severe hypertension; 6) Patients with diabetes mellitus and uncontrolled condition after treatment;"

Notices for exercise of subjects with coronary heart disease: 1) Avoid training in bad weather, training before noon or afternoon in winter and early morning or evening in summer. 2) When walking, avoid windward, upper and lower steps and explosive force; 3) Avoid excessive exertion of upper limbs, especially lifting weights; 4) Avoid emotional excitement, tension and anger. In such cases, stop exercising and learn to relax. 5) When you feel tired, chest pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, whatever you are doing, you should stop and rest immediately. 6) Do not exceed the target heart rate prescribed by the doctor. 7) insist on taking medicine according to doctor's advice. Do not randomly add or subtract prescribed medicines by doctors; if some acute diseases occur, such as colds, diarrhea, etc. , stop training. 4. Motion Method 1) Type of exercise: Walking, jogging, cycling or fitness bike, swimming and other sports are more suitable for coronary heart disease subjects. Because these sports belong to low to moderate intens ity sports, mainly endurance sports. The energy metabolism of these exercises is mainly in the form of aerobic metabolism, so it is called ""aerobic exercise"" in medicine. Long -term exercise can improve the body's oxygen carrying capacity and cardiopulmonar y function. 2) V olume of exercise: It is mainly composed of intensity, duration and frequency of exercise, which can be coordinated with each other. ① The intensity of exercise is an important index to ensure that the effect of exercise is achieved without causing danger. Exercise intensity can be divided into three levels (low intensity, medium intensity and high intensity). It is measured by the amount of oxygen consumption during exercise. The greater the oxygen consumption, the greater the intensity of exercise. However, because it is difficult to measure oxygen consumption in clinical practice, heart rate is often used as the most pract ical index to measure exercise"

The subjects only needed to count their own pulse for 15 seconds, multiplied by 4, to get a heart rate per minute. But this method is only suitable for subjects without arrhythmia. The highest he art rate at low and moderate intensity exercise was 100 beats per minute and 100 -120 beats per minute respectively. Generally speaking, subjects with coronary heart disease can exercise at low to moderate intensity. ② Number of exercises: exerc ise 3 to 5 times a week to achieve the purpose of calcination. ③ Exercise time: 30 -40 minutes each time, including 5 -10 minutes of preparation exercise; 15 -20 minutes of formal exercise, during which the expected heart rate can be achieved; 5 -10 minutes of finishing exercise. 3) Generally speaking, the slight increase of systolic blood pressure (systolic blood pressure does not exceed 20 mmHg) and the increase of heart rate (the ratio of heart rate to activity does not exceed 20 beats/min or the maximum hea rt rate does not exceed 120 beats/min) after exercise are normal reactions. But if there are shortness of breath, angina pectoris, arrhythmia, dizziness, nausea, paleness and long -term fatigue, insomnia and other discomforts after the activity, it is sugge sted that this exercise should be reduced or suspended in the next exercise."
