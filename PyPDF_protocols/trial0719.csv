Evaluate pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of teprotumumab to estimate exposure and understand PK -PD relationships. Study Design: All subjects who choose to participate will receive up to 8 infusions of teprotumumab (10 mg/kg for the fi rst infusion followed by 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions) in an open- label fashion., with the number of infusions determined by the Investigator’s clinical judgment (but not to exceed 8 infusions) The Baseline (Day 1) Visit of this extension study w ill occur within 14 days after the final visit of Study HZNP- TEP-301 (Week 24 for proptosis non-responders and up to Week 72 for subjects who relapse). During the open- label Treatment Period, study drug infusions are scheduled for Day 1 (Baseline), and Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 (with a final visit at Week 24 of the 24- Week Treatment Period ). When the Investigator considers treatment to be complete, subjects will have an End ofTreatment (EOT) Visit 3 weeks after the final infusion and undergo the scheduled EOT assessments. After completion of the Treatment Period, subjects who we re proptosis non -responders in Study HZNP -TEP- 301 will enter a 24- week Follow-Up Period, during which study drug will not be administered and clinic visits are scheduled for 1, 3, and 6 months (Visits Month 7, 9 and 12) after the Week 24 EOT Visit; if any of these subjects discontinue from the Follow-Up Period prior to the Month 12 Visit, they will return to the clinic and undergo the scheduled Month 12 assessments prior to study discharge. Those who complete the Month 12 Visit will be contacted 6 and 12 months later via phone or email by research staff to enquire if any treatment for TED has been received since last study contact. If yes, subject will be questioned regarding type of treatment and outcome/response. Subjects who relapse during the Follow-Up Period of HZNP- TEP-301 and choose to enter this extension study will not participate in the Follow-Up Period. For these subjects, the last clinic visit is at Week 24. Those who complete the Week 24 Visit will be contacted 6 and"

Once the Investigator deems study drug dosing to be complete, or i If subjects wish to discontinue study drug during the open-label Treatment Period, subjects will return for a clinic visit 3 weeks after the final dose and undergo the Week 24 End ofTreatment (EOT) assessments, except for PK and ADA evaluations. Subjects who were proptosis non-responders at Week 24 of HZNP-TEP -301 will be encouraged to continue study participation in the Follow-Up Period. 5. If a subject wishes to prematurely discontinue from the study during the Follow -Up Period, he/she will return for a clinic visit and undergo the Month 12 (End of Study [EOS]) assessments prior to discharge. 6. On Day 1 (Baseline), subjects will receive the first dose of study drug; however, Baseline assessments will be performed prior to dosing. 7. Day 1 will occur within 14 days after the final visit of Study HZNP -TEP -301 (Week 24 for proptosis non-responders and up to Week 72 for subjects who relapse). 8. Dosing will be adjusted if there is a change in weight during the Treatment Period. The weight obtained at Week 12 can be used in dose calculations beginning at Week 12 or Week 15. 9. If Day 1 of the extension study occurs on the same day as the final visit of HZNP -TEP-301 (Week 24 [or PW1] for proptosis non-responders and Week 72 [or PW2] for subjects who relapse), assessments do not need to be repeated, and the final assessments from the lead-in study will serve as the Baseline assessments for the extension study. 10.

Phone (or email) contact by research staff focusing on safety and tolerability aspects will be made the day after infusion for the first and second infusions, and thereafter as deemed appropriate . In addition, subjects who experience an infusion-associated event after any subsequent infusion will also be contacted by phone (or email) by research staff the day after the infusion , and thereafter as deemed appropriate . 12. Perform urine pregnancy tests prior to dose (as applicable) for female subjects of childbearing potential (including those with an onset of menopause <2 years prior to Baseline of HZNP-TEP -302, non -therapy- induced amenorrhea for <12 months prior to Baselin e of HZNP -TEP -302, or not surgically sterile [absence of ovaries and/or uterus]). 13. Physical exam will include assessment of presence or absence of pretibial myxedema on Day 1 and Week 24/PW EOT of the Treatment Period and Month 12/ PWEOS of the Follow-Up Period. If present, measurements of instep and calf will be taken. 14. Ophthalmic exam : best corrected visual acuity, pupil exam, color vision assessment , Ishihara color plates (or equivalent) or related red desaturation, intraocular pressure , and slit lam p exam. If significant abnormalities are noted compared to previous visits , including a loss of 2 lines or more of vision, development of pupil abnormalities including APD, rise in intraocular pressure, development of corneal infiltrates or other abnormalities not here specified but of concern to the ophthalmologist, further investigations of visual function will be conducted according to the ophthalmologist decision. 15. V ital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature) will be measured at all clinic visits. Vital signs will be measure d pre- and post -infusion on Day 1 and Week 3, and pre -dose on all other infusion days . Additional vital signs will be monitored if infusion-associated AEs occur (see Section 9.5.4.3 for details). 16. Non-diabetic subject s should be fasting at Weeks 1 and 4 only. Diabetic subject s should be fasting at each visit blood glucose is evaluated. 17. ALT/AST must be ≤3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) and serum creatinine must be <1.5 x the ULN (according to age ) at the most recent clinic visit to be eligible for enrollment. 18. Subject s must be euthyroid with the baseline disease under control or have mild hypo- or hyperthyroidism (defined as free thyroxine [FT4] and free triiodothyronine [FT3] levels < 50% above or below the normal limits) at the most recent clinic visit . Every effort should be made to correct the mild hypo - or hyperthyroidism promptly and to mainta in the euthyroid state for the full duration of the clinical trial. 19. HbA1c must be < 9.0% at the most recent clinic visit. If the HbA1c is elevated and considered clinically significant at any time point after Baseline , it will be repeated approximately every 45 days until it returns to normal or the baseline value. 20. If a sample is positive in the ADA test, after confirmatory and reactive titer testing, the sample will then be tested for NAb. If the subject tests positive for NAb, he/she will be followed until levels either revert to Baseline or the subject’s value decreases or remains stable.

The criteria to determine relapse is the following: • Increase in proptosis of ≥ 2 mm in the study eye since Week 24 of HZNP- TEP-301, or • An increase in CAS of ≥ 2 points since Week 24 with an absolute CAS of ≥ 4 in the study eye following Week 24 of HZNP- TEP-301. • In addition to one of the bullet points above, the Investigator should also consider the subject’s symptomology to ensure a relapse has occur red (e.g., new onset of double vision). 9.4.1 Treatments Administered All study drug dosing will be performed at the clinic under the supervision of clinic staff. Subjects will receive up to 8 infusions of teprotumumab (10 mg/kg on Day 1 followed by 20 mg/kg q3W for the remaining infusions) in an open- label fashion ; the number of infusions will be determined by the Investigator’s clinical judgment. The infusion rate may be reduced and the dose may be interrupted or held based on tolerability (see Section 9.4.6.3.2 for details). The first and second infusions will be administered over approximately 90 minutes (but not less than 80 minutes) . Subsequent infusions will be administered over approximately 60 minutes (but not less than 50 minutes), period providing there are no significant infusion- associated events. 9.4.6.2 Determination of Dose Volume The volume of study drug to be administered will be determined by the electronic data capture (EDC) interactive web response system (IWRS) and will be based on the subject’s weight. The first dose will be 10 mg/kg, and subsequent doses will be 20 mg/kg. Weight will be measured on Day 1 and Weeks 12 and 24 during the Treatment Period. The dose on Day 1 may be based on the weight determined at the most recent clinic visit, provided the most recent visit was within the prior 3 weeks. The doses on Week 3 through Week 912 will be based on the weight determined on Day 1. The weight used in the Week 12 dose calculation can be the weight determined on Day 1 or the weight obtained at Week 12.

After completion of the Treatment Period, subjects who were proptosis non-responders in Study HZNP -TEP- 301 will enter a 24-week Follow -Up Period , during which study drug will not be administered and clinic visits are scheduled for 1, 3, and 6 months (Visits Month 7, 9 and 12) after the Week 24 Visit ; if any of these subjects discontinue from the Follow -Up Period prior to the Month 12 Visit, they will return to t he clinic and undergo the scheduled Month 12 assessments prior to study discharge. Those who complete the Month 12 Visit will be contacted 6 and 12 months later via phone or email by research staff to enquire if any treatment for TED has been received since last study contact. If yes, subject will be questioned regarding type of treatment and outcome/response. Subjects who re lapse during the Follow- Up Period of HZNP -TEP-301 and ch oose to enter this extension study will not participate in the Follow -Up Perio d. For these subjects, the last clinic visit is at Week 24. Those who complete the Week 24 Visit will be contacted 6 and 12 months later via phone or email by research staff to enquire if any treatment for TED has been received since last study contact. If yes, subject will be questioned regarding type of treatment and outcome/response. An overview of the study design is presented in the schematic below, and d etails of study activities are provided in Section 2.1, Schedule of Assessments ."

Subjects will be ineligible if, in the opinion of the Investigator, they are unlikely to comply with the study protocol or have a concomitant disease or condition that could interfere with the conduct of the study or potentially put the subject at unacceptable risk. The exclusion criteria (except those related to screening) of protocol HZNP -TEP-301 also apply to this open -label exten sion study. Dose Regimen/Route of Administration: All study drug dosing will be performed at the clinic under the supervision of clinic staff. Subjects will receive 8 infusions of teprotumumab (10 mg/kg on Day 1 followed by 20 mg/kg q3W for the remaining 7 infusions) in an open -label fashion. The infusion rate may be reduced and the dose may be interrupted or held based on tolerability (see Section 9.4.6.3.2 for details) . The first and second infusions will be administered over approximately 90 minutes (but not less than 80 minutes). Subsequent infusions will be administered over a pproximately 60 minute s (but not less than 50 minutes), providing there are no significant infusion- associated events. Dosage Form and Strength Formulation: Teprotumumab 500 mg will be provided in single -dose 20 mL glass vials as a freeze- dried powder . Each vial of teprotumu mab will be reconstituted with 10 mL of water for injection. The resulting solution will have an approximate concentration of 50 mg/mL teprotumumab. Reconstituted teprotumumab solution will be further diluted in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride (NaCl) solution prior to administration. Doses up to 1800 mg will be administered in a total infusion volume of 100 mL, and those above 1800 mg will be administered in a total infusion volume of 250 mL. To maintain a constant volume in the infusion bags, a volume equal to the volume of teprotumumab to be placed into the infusion bag will be first removed from the infusion bag using a sterile syringe and needle. The appropriate volume of reconstituted drug product solution based on the subject`s dose and body weight will be withdrawn and the teprot umumab reconstituted drug product solution will be diluted with normal saline ( 0.9% NaCl) in the infusion bag."

Subjects who were proptosis non-responders in Study HZNP -TEP- 301 are scheduled to participate in a 6 -month Follow -Up Period in this extension study ; subjects who relapsed in Study HZNP -TEP- 301 and are retreated in this extension study will not partici pate in the Follow -Up Period. Subjects who complete the study (Month 12 Visit for proptosis non- responders in Study HZNP -TEP- 301 and Week 24 Visit for subjects who relapsed during the Follow -up Period in Study HZNP -TEP-301) will be contacted 6 and 12 months after the last visit via phone or email by research staff to enquire if any treatment for TED has been received since last study contact. Criteria for Evaluation: The ""study eye"" (i.e., most severely affected eye) will remain the same as that identified at the Baseline ( Day 1 ) Visit of Study HZNP -TEP- 301. Both eyes will be assessed for efficacy but the study eye will be used to assess the primary outcome measure. Efficacy will be assessed by proptosis (measured as exophthalmos evaluation of the Clinical Measures of Severity using a Hertel instrument provided by the Sponsor for consistency in measurement ), CAS (7-item scale), diplopia ( measured as part of the Clinical Measures of Severity ) and Clinical Measures of Severity (including motility restriction assessments ). Quality of life will be assessed using the GO-QoL questionnaire. Safety will be assessed via AE and concomitant medication use monitoring, immunogenicity testing, physical and oph thalmic examinations, vital signs, clinical safety laboratory evaluations (complete blood count, chemistry (including thyroid panel and HbA1 c), and urinalysis), pregnancy testing (if applicable), and electrocardiograms (ECG) . The study will also be monitor ed by a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Statistical Analyses : The primary analyses will be conducted on the Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population . All efficacy and safety endpoints will be summarized using descriptive statistics , and summaries will be stratified by the treatment received in HZNP -TEP- 301 as well as overall. Study endpoints will be evaluated for all subjects from Baseline to Week 24 . Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary outcome measure is the effect of teprotumumab on the proptosis respond er rate at Week 24 . Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Secondary efficacy endpoints include the percentage of subjects with a CAS value of 0 or 1 at Week 24 , mean change from Baseline to Week 24 in the “study eye” proptosis measurement , diplopia responder rate at Week 24, and mean change from Baseline to Week 24 in GO-QoL questionnaire overall score . Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints Week 24 data will be summarized for the overall responder rate, the Clinical Measures of Severity individual response status frequencies , the percentage of responders for each component of the Clinical Measures of Severity, and the overall responder rate stratified by the level of response. Mean changes from Baseline to Week 24 will be summarized for the CAS , the GO -QoL questionnaire VF and A subscale scores , and the motility component of the C linical Measures of Severity . PK parameters will be summarized. Sample Size Estimate : The sample size is not based on statistical considerations. Subjects who are proptosis non-responders at Week 24 of HZNP -TEP- 301 or who were proptosis responders at Week 24 but m eet the criteria for re -treatment due to relapse during the Follow -Up Period of HZNP -TEP-301 will be eligible for enrollment."

If significant abnormalities are noted compared to previous vis its, including a loss of 2 lines or more of vision, development of pupil abnormalities including APD, rise in intraocular pressure, development of corneal infiltrates or other abnormalities not here specified but of concern to the ophthalmologist, further investigations of visual function will be conducted according to the ophthalmologist decision. 15. Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature) will be measured at all clinic visits. Vital signs will be measure d pre- and post -infusion on Day 1 and Week 3, and pre-dose on all other infusion days. Additional vital signs will be monitored if infusion-associated AEs occur (see Section 9.5.4.3 for details). 16. Non-diabetic subject s should be fasting at Weeks 1 and 4 only. Diabetic subject s should be fasting at each visit blood glucose is evaluated. 17. ALT/AST must be ≤3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) and serum creatinine must be <1.5 x the ULN (according to age ) at the most recent clinic visit to be eligible for enrollment. 18. Subject s must be euthyroid with the baseline disease under control or have mild hypo- or hyperthyroidism (defined as free thyroxine [FT4] and free triiodothyronine [FT3] levels < 50% above or below the normal limits) at the most recent clinic visit . Every effort should be made to correct the mild hypo - or hyperthyroidism promptly and to maintain the euthyroid state for the full duration of the clinical trial. 19. HbA1 c must be < 9.0% at the most recent clinic visit. If the HbA1 c is elevated and considered clinically significant at any time point after Baseline , it will be re peated approximately every 45 days until it returns to normal or the baseline value. 20. If a sample is positive in the ADA test, after confirmatory and reactive titer testing, the sample will then be tested for NAb. If the subject tests positive for NAb, he/she will be followed until levels either revert to Baseline or the subject’s value decreases or remains stable. Any subject with a positi ve NAb test at Week 48 (or PW) during the Follow - Up Period will continue to be followed until the subject’s value decreases or remains stable . 21. Not collected for subjects who prematurely discontinue from the open-label Treatment Period. 22. Adverse events that are ongoing at completion of HZNP-TEP -301 and/ or occur prior to dosing on Day 1 will be considered pre -dose AEs. Adverse events occurring or worsening after the dose on Day 1 through the end of the Treatment Period will be considered treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs). Adverse events occurring or worsening during the Follow -Up Period will be considered postdose AEs. All SAEs that occur from the signing of informed consent through 30 days after study discontinuation will be recorded. 23. PK samples will be collected prior to, and at the end of, the infusion on Day 1 and Weeks 3 and 9 of the open- label Treatment Period; additional single samples will be collected at Weeks 1, 4, and 24. 24.

TED is divided by severity into mild, moderate, and severe disease, with moderate- to-severe disease representing 25 -50% of cases [ Bartley, 1994; Noth et al, 2001; Tanda et al, 2013]. In term s of time course, TED can be considered as 2 distinct conditions: “active TED,” which is an autoimmune inflammatory response targeting orbital soft tissues; and “inactive TED,” which is the name given to the expanded and fibrotic tissues that are the seque lae of the active disease. Active TED typically lasts 1 to 3 years, and then the inflammation spontaneously subsides to leave the permanent pathology of inactive TED [ Burch et al, 1993]. The annual incidence rate of TED in the US has been estimated to be 16 cases per 100,000 people for women and 2.9 cases per 100,000 people for men [ Bartley, 1994]. The incidence appears to be comparable in Europe [ Abraham-Nordling et al, 2011; Mostbeck et al, 1998; Noth et al, 2001 ; Tanda et al, 2013]. Patients aged between 30 and 50 years are most frequently affected, with severe cases more frequent in those older than 50 years [Dickinson, 2010 ]. The occurrence and severity of TED is associated with smoking [ Prummel et al, 1993]. A mounting body of evidence in the scientific literature indicates that the pathophysiology of active TED involves the autoimmune activation and proliferation of orbital fibroblasts [Bahn, 2010; Boschi et al, 2005; Smith, 2010] . The activation of fibroblasts triggers release of inflammatory cytokines, infiltration of immune cells into orbital soft tissues (muscle, interstitial and adipose), excessive synthesis of extracellular matrix, and tissue expansion and remodeling (ibid). Clinical features of moderate -to-severe TED include orbital pain, swelling, dry eye, redness and discomfort of the lids and ocular surface, thickening and retraction of the eyel ids, and proptosis (exophthalmos) due to the expansion of tissue behind the eye [ Bahn, 2010; Burch et al, 1993 ; Dickinson, 2010; Mallika et al, 2009 ]. In its moderate -to-severe form, TED has high morbidity [ Bartalena et al, 2008 ; Bartley, 1994; Dickinson, 2010; Gerding et al, 1997 ]. Morbidity takes the form of orbital pain, together with a number of serious, sight- threatening conditions, including diplopia (due to inability to correctly align the eyes), corneal ulceration (due to inability to close lids), and dysthyroid optic neuropathy (due to proptosis, tissue crowding, and stress on the optic nerve). These combine to produce marked reductions in quality of life (QoL) (e.g., physical functioning, role functioning, social functioning, mental health, health perceptions, and pain) [ Gerding et al, 1997; C. Terwee et al, 2002]. TED can also produce profound psychosocial problems, in particular anxiety and depression, due to the alarming and disfiguring changes in appearance [ Bartley et al, 1996; Coulter et al, 2007; G. J. Kahaly et al, 2005]. Taken toget her, these data show that moderate- to- severe active TED is a physically and emotionally debilitating condition ( Figure 7.1)."

Center – upper & lower: Inflammation of orbital tissues – a hallmark symptom of active GO. Right – upper & lower: Corneal inflammation and ulceration – a problem when patients are unable to fully close their eyelids. For mild active TED, “watchful waitin g” is considered appropriate for a proportion of patients, especially those with a satisfactory Qo L [Bartalena et al, 2000 ]. In the mild condition, signs and symptoms can resolve leaving minor or no clinically relevant sequelae as inactive TED. In contrast, moderate- to-severe active TED often requires prompt treatment [ Burch et al, 1993; G.J. Kahaly, 2010]. There are no approved therapies. Currently, the most commonly used medical therapies for moderate- to-severe active TED are high -dose corticosteroids [ Bartalena et al, 2012 ; G.J. Kahaly, 2010], and in recent years rituximab [ Salvi et al, 2015; Silkiss et al, 2010 ], neither of which is approved for treatment of TED. The most common nonmedica l methods for treating moderate- to-severe active TED are orbital radiation and emergency decompression surgeries [Baril et al, 2014 ; Prummel et al, 2004] . All treatments for moderate -to-severe active TED are viewed as suboptimal due to inadequate efficacy and significant tolerability issues and safety concerns [ Bartalena et al, 2012; Gasinska et al, 2012; Gorman et al, 2001 ; Melamud et al, 2014 ; Perez et al, 2014; Poetker et al, 2010; Stan et al, 2015; Zang et al, 2011]. Inactive TED is treated by rehabilitative and cosmetic surgeries, wi th the goal to reduce proptosis, correct strabismus, minimize eyelid retraction, and address disfiguration [ Baldeschi, 2010]. Surgical treatment of inactive TED is essentially an attempt to repair the damage done by the active disease once it has run its course . It is widely stated in the literature that there is significant unmet medical need in TED, and specifically that novel pharmacotherapies with improved efficacy and better tolerability are needed to treat active disease [Bahn, 2012; Bartalena, 2013; Bartalena et al, 2000 ; Coulter et al, 2007; Naik et al, 2010 ; Stan et al, 2015; C. Terwee et al, 2002 ]. Teprotumumab has the potential to meet these requirem ents by specifically blocking the autoimmune pathophysiology thought to underlie active TED."

The primary molecular mechanism through which GD- IgGs produce hyperthyroidism is believed to be activation of thyroid stimulating hormone receptors (TSHR) in thyroid follicular cells [Akamizu, 2001]. TED also has an autoimmune basis, but in this case, the primary cellular target appears to be orbital fibroblasts. GD -IgGs stimulate orbital fibroblasts to proliferate, release cytokines, initiate an inflammatory response, differentiate into adipocytes and myofibroblasts, and to secrete excessive amounts of extracellular matrix (e.g., hyaluronan), which in turn results in fibrosis and edema [ Smith, 2010] . It was initially assumed that, as with Graves’ hyperthyroidism, GD-IgGs produced TED through activat ion of TSHR. However, the data for this has never been definitive and a number of lines of evidence argue against there being a single, common molecular target for the 2 conditions. For example, it is not uncommon for there to be longitudinal misalignments in the time courses of Graves’ hyperthyroidism and TED ; approximately 10% of TED patients never become hyperthyroid and some TED patients experience unilateral eye symptoms. Moreover, there is disagreement in the literature about whether the levels of TSH R expressed in orbital tissues are alone sufficient to trigger and drive TED (e.g., [Bahn, 2010; Boschi et al, 2005 ; Smith et al, 2004]). There are no well -established animal models for TED , and this has hampered both the study of mechanism and the discovery of novel therapeutics. Nevertheless, evidence is now accumulating that TSHR may not be the only autoantigen that is involved in regulating TED pathology. Specifically, a substantial body of data has been generated arguing that the insulin- like growth factor -1 receptor (IGF -1R) plays an important role in regulating the pathophysiological responses produced in orbital and immune cells by GD-IgGs . Key nonclinical data supporting the involvement of IGF -1R in the mechanism of active TED are: 1. IGF-1R is localized on orbital fibroblasts and binding of IGF to fibroblasts can be displaced by GD- IgGs [Weightman et al, 1993]. 2. IGF-1R is up- regulated in cultured orbital fibroblasts from patients with TED, while TSHR is only expressed at low levels [Tsui et al, 2008]. 3. Stimulation of IGF -1R by GD- IgGs in orbital fibroblasts from patients with TED causes increased release of the T -cell attracting cytokines IL -16 and RANTES [Pritchard et al, 2003] . Importantly, this effect of GD -IgGs is fully reversed by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) antagonist specific for IGF -1R. 4. IGF-1 and GD-IgGs increase hyaluronan synthesis in orbit al fibroblasts from patients with TED, but not in orbital fibroblasts from control subjects or dermal fibroblasts [Smith et al, 2004] . Again, t his effect of GD -IgGs is blocked by a selective IGF -1R antagonist antibody. Interestingly, in these studies thyroid stimulating hormone ( TSH ) failed to stimulate hyaluronan synthesis in orbital fibroblasts from patients with TED. 5. IGF-1R expression is increased on both T- cells and B -cells from patients with TED, providing additional, immune -based mechanisms through which GD-IgGs acting on IGF- 1R would promote an inflammatory response [ Douglas et al, 2007; Douglas et al, 2008 ]."

Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. for the treatment of subjects with advanced solid tumors, including sarcoma. Development for this indication was discontinued based on insufficient clinical efficacy and was not based on any observed safety issues in the more than 700 subjects treated in the oncology program. Teprotumumab is currently being developed by Horizon for subjects with moderate- to-severe active TED (also known as Graves’ Ophthalmopathy or Orbitopathy [GO] and Thyroid- Associated Ophthalmopathy [TAO]). The pharmacokinetics (PK) of teprotumumab were characterized by Roche. A biomarker to assess target interaction – increases in serum IGF -1 – was also identified. PK/PD m odeling indicated that concentrations of 20 μg/mL re sulted in > 90% IGF-1R receptor occupancy, and that d oses that produced teprotumumab trough blood concentrations of 20 μg/mL were well tolerated. The clinical safety database of teprotumumab in oncology was likely confounded by the comorbidity of late stage cancer an d concomitant administration of other treatment s. The oncology studies, however, did identify a number of potential AEs of special interest (AESIs: infusion-associated events, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and anemia) and these events were monitored car efully in the initial study in TED subject s, TED01RV. TED01RV was the first study in which non-oncology subject s received teprotumumab. This study enrolled 87 subject s (43 teprotumumab; 44 placebo) between the ages of 18 and 75 years with recent onset (≤ 9 months from diagnosis) moderate- to-severe active TED . The primary efficacy endpoint was the overall responder rate ( decreases from Baseline of ≥ 2 points in overall Clinical Activity Score [ CAS ] and ≥ 2 mm in proptosis, provided that there was no deterioration [i.e., increase s of ≥ 2 points in CAS o r ≥ 2 mm in proptosis] in the non-study eye) at the end of the 24- week treatment phase. In this study, the responder rate was significant ly greater with teprotumumab treatment compared to placebo ( 69% versus 20%; p < 0.001) at Week 24 . Therapeutic effects were rapid, with increased responder rates in the teprotumumab group relative to placebo detected at Weeks 6, 12, and 18 (all p < 0.001). The secondary endpoints (QoL, proptosis, and CAS as continuous variables) all supported the primary analysis conclusion that teprotumumab was superior to placebo in the treatment of TED . Population PK modeling in TED01RV confirmed that trough concentrations were consistently above the 20 μg /mL threshold, which had been previously determined by Roche PK/PD modeling as result ing in > 90% IGF -1R occupancy in the tissues. Results of the TED01RV study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine [ Smith et al, 2017]. Of the AE SIs identified in the oncology studies (i.e., infusion- associated events, thrombocytopenia, hyperglycemia, and anemia), the only one that emerged in the initial trial in subjects with TED was hyperglycemia. Among subjects treated with teprotumumab, hyperglycemia was uniformly mild in non-diabetic subjects and adequately controlled by"

Clinically relevant levels of ADAs were not detected in any subject . In the Phase 2 study, three non- serious adverse events (AEs) involving hearing impairment occurred in the teprotumumab group. A 59- year-old subject experienced acute bilateral hearing abnormality approximately 12 weeks following the 1st infusion of teprotumumab with resolution several months following the last infusion. A second 43- year-old subject with eustachian tube dysfunction experienced hearing loss nearly 4 months following discontinuation of teprotumumab. A third 60-year-old subject with a history of tinnitus experienced hearing loss following loud noise exposure. While a causal relationship between teprotumumab and the event"

At the third infusion visit, the subject was pre-medicated with diphenhydramine, dexamethasone, famotidine and Tylenol and had a similar reaction prior to the study drug infusion. Among non- diabetic subject s, hyperglycemia occurred at comparable rates in both treatment groups and was uniformly Grade 1 and intermittent. Among diabetic subject s, Grade 2 or 3 hyperglycemia occurred in some teprotumumab- treated subject s; this was well -controlled after diabetes medication adjustment. Glycemic control, as assessed by HbA1 c, was at baseline levels following the treatment phase for all subjects in the teprotumumab group. No subject s experienced thrombocytopenia as an AE.

In general, the decision to keep a subject on study treatment with teprotumumab should take into consideration potential risks and benefits to the subject . Prior to all future infusions of teprotumumab, these subject s should be pre-medicated with IV diphenhydramine 1 to 1.25 mg/kg (maximum: 50 mg), IV ranitidine 50 mg, IV dexamethasone 0.4 mg/kg (maximum: 20 mg), and/or acetaminophen 500 mg. In addition, all future infusions should be administered over approximately 90 minutes (but not less than 80 minutes) . Vital signs should be taken every 15 minutes during the infusion. Subject s who experience delayed -type hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., skin rash ) may remain in the study at the discretion of the Investigator, and prior to all future infusions of teprotumumab, should be pre-medicated with the above medications (diphenhydramine, ranitidine, dexamethasone, and/or acetaminophen). Subjects who experience a worsening delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction following repeated infusions of teprotumumab or who have other signs of serum- sickness (e.g., delayed fever, myalgias, arthralgias) may be removed from the study after discussion with the Investigator a nd Sponsor. Hyperglycemia In preclinical studies, there was no in vitro cross -reactivity of teprotumumab with the insulin receptor. During TED01RV, among non- diabetic subjects, hyperglycemia occurred at comparable rates in both treatment groups and was uniformly Grade 1 and intermittent. Among diabetic subject s, Grade 2 or 3 hyperglycemia occurred in some teprotumumab- treated subject s; this was well -controlled after diabetes medication adjustment. Glycemic control, as assessed by HbA1 c, was at baseline levels following the treatment phase for all subject s in the teprotumumab group. Subject s with known controlled diabetes mellitus are allowed to participate in studies with teprotumumab. HbA1c levels should be monitored regularly in these subjects. Investigators are strongly encouraged to adjust their subjects’ diabetes management to maintain subject s’ HbA1c levels at ≤ 7%. In the event a subject ’s HbA1c level rises to > 7% while in the study, the Investigator must determine the risk versus benefit for each subject to remain in the study. Fasting glucose levels (after at least an 8 -hour fast) should be tested at B aseline. Hyperglycemia should be promptly investigated and managed. Subjects with recurrent hyperglycemia, defined as a fasting glucose level of moderate intensity (glucose >160 – 250 mg/dL), will require evaluation for diabetes mellitus (e .g., fasting glucose, glucose tolerance, and HbA1c tests) and appropriate medical m anagement at the discretion of the Investigator. Muscle Spasms During the TED01RV study, muscle spasms were identified in 19% of the subjects receiving teprotumumab versus 5% of those receiving placebo. In the teprotumumab group, 8 subjects had muscle spas ms (6 had Grade 1 and 2 had Grade 2 ); only 2 subjects experienced the event for longer than one week and were treated with muscle relaxants.

Diarrhea In the TED01RV study, diarrhea occurred in 14% of subjects receiving teprotumumab versus 5% of those receiving placebo. In the teprotumumab group, 8 subje cts had diarrhea ( 5 had Grade 1, 2 had Grade 2, and 1 had a Grade 3 [ severe]), with 2 subjects requiring treatment . The severe diarrhea (Grade 3) occurred in a subject with a history of colitis and was considered possibly related to study drug. This subject was subsequently diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and required colectomy leading to discontinuation from the study. Additionally, another subject was diagnosed with IBD during the course of the study. Both subjects likely had IBD as a pre-existing condition, prior to study start. However, given the temporal sequence, exacerbation of underlying IBD by teprotumumab cannot be excluded at this time. Therefore, diarrhea that is progressive and persistent, or has features of IBD such as bloody stools or abdom inal pain , should undergo prompt evaluation to exclude IBD or other serious conditions. If possible, avoid medications known to cause diarrhea such as laxatives and magnesium. 7.2 Rationale for th is Study Multiple lines of evidence indicate that IGF -1R plays a critical role in regulating the autoimmune response that underlies TED. Teprotumumab is a mAb with low nanomolar affinity for human IGF-1R. Binding of teprotumumab to IGF -1R blocks receptor activation by agonists, IGF1 and IGF2, and also causes direct inactivation of the receptor through antibody-induced internalization. Teprotumumab has no agonist activity for canonical IGF-1R signaling pathways and is highly selective; in particular, it does not recognize the insulin receptor. T eprotumumab is well-tolerated in humans at doses that produce > 90% IGF-1R occupancy. Systemic administration of teprotumumab to subjects with moderate- to-severe active TED should, therefore , attenuate all disease symptoms that are dependent on IGF -1R acti vation. This argument holds whether IGF-1R is being activated by GD-IgG or endogenous ligands IGF-1 and IGF2, or whether the receptor is expressed on fibroblasts, progenitor fibrocytes, adipocytes, or lymphocytes. Moreover, inhibition of IGF-1R receptor function with an antibody may also attenuate signaling through the TSHR, an autoantigen that has been implicated in TED, because IGF-1R and TSHR are physically and functionally coupled. Teprotumumab, therefore , has the potential to treat TED at multiple diff erent molecular and cellular levels. Administering teprotumumab early in active TED is designed to reduce the intensity and duration of the active disease, minimize the sequelae that are carried over to constitute inactive TED , and thereby have a benefici al effect on long- term outcome , reducing the need for corrective surgeries. Previous preclinical and clinical experience indicates that, at doses that are pharmacologically relevant for blocking IGF-1R, teprotumumab has an acceptable safety profile following IV infusion and is, therefore , a suitable drug candidate to be investigated in the TED indication."

This is a multi -center, open -label extension study of HZNP- TEP-301 examining the safety and efficacy of teprotumumab in the treatment of TED in adult subjects. Subjects wh o complete the 24-week double- masked Treatment Period in Study HZNP- TEP-301 and are proptosis non-responders or were proptosis responders at Week 24 but me et the criteria for re -treatment due to relapse (see Section 9.3.4) during the Follow-Up Period of HZNP -TEP-301 will be eligible for enrollment. The study treatment previously administered in HZNP- TEP-301 (teprotumumab or placebo) will remain maske d throughout this extension study. All subjects who choose to participate will receive 8 infusions of teprotumumab (10 mg/kg for the first infusion followed by 20 mg/kg for the remaining 7 infusions) in an open-label fashion. The Baseline (Day 1) Visit of this extension study will occur within 14 days after the final visit of Study HZNP- TEP-301 (Week 24 for proptosis non-responders and up to Week 72 for subjects who relapse). During the open-label Treatment Period, study drug infusions are scheduled for Day 1 (Baseline), and Weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 (with a final visit at Week 24 of the 24-Week Treatment Period ). All study drug dosing will be performed at the clinic under the supervision of clinic staff, and at any scheduled infusion, the infusion rate may be reduced or the dose may be interrupted or held based on decreased tolerability (see Section 9.4.6.3.2 for details). On each dosing day, scheduled assessments (except for adverse event [AE] and concomitant medication use monitoring, which will be monitored throughout the clinic visit) will be completed prior to study drug dosing. After each of the first 2 infusions, subjects will be contacted by phone/email the following day and will return to the clinic 1 week after the infusion (Weeks 1 and 4) for safety and tolerability assessments; additional phone/email contacts and clin ic visits may also be conducted for any subject experiencing an infusion- associated event. After completion of the Treatment Period, subjects who were proptosis non -responders in Study HZNP -TEP- 301 will enter a 24 -week Follow-Up Period, during which study drug will not be administered and clinic visits are scheduled for 1, 3, and 6 months (visit months 7, 9, and 12) after the Week 24 Visit; if any of these subjects discontinue from the Follow-Up Period prior to the Month 12 Visit, they will return to the cl inic and undergo the scheduled Month 12 assessments prior to study discharge. Those who complete the Month 12 Visit will be contacted 6 and 12 months later via phone or email by research staff to enquire if any treatment for TED has been received since last study contact. If yes, subject will be questioned regarding type of treatment and outcome/response."

Upon arrival of investigational products at the site, the investigational pharmacist or site personnel not assigned to the study should check them for damage and verify proper identity, quantity, integrity of seals, and temperature conditions, and report any deviations or product complaints to the monitor/Sponsor upon discovery. 9.4.4 Storage Recommended storage conditions for the freeze-dried teprotumumab drug product are between 2°C to 8 °C (36 °F to 46°F), protected from light. Storage at ambient temperature of the reconstituted teprotumumab solution should be limited to 4 hours. For batch- specific information on shelf- life, see the packaging. The IV infusion should be administered at room temperature (20°C to 24°C [68°F to 75 °F]). The diluted product should be used within 4 hours of preparation. However, if not used within 4 hours, and if dilution has taken place under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, the infusion solution can be stored for up to 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36 °F to 46°F). An Investigational Pharmacy Manual will be provided to all sites and further describe these processes in detail. At the clinic, all study medications m ust be stored in a secure area with limited access, and a daily temperature log of the drug storage area will be maintained every working day; deviations from the specified temperature range will be reported as protocol deviations. 9.4.5 Drug Accountability The Principal Investigator at each site is responsible for the control of all study medication and delegating infusion bag preparation and drug accountability responsibilities to a pharmacist (or designee in accordance with institutional policies and local regulations), who must maintain adequate records of the receipt and disposition of all study medication shipped to the study center. Records will include receipt dates, condition at time of receipt, quantities received, quantities dispensed, quantities returned or destroyed, and the identification numbers of the subjects who received study medication. As permitted by site policy, a ll empty, partially empty, and full vials of study drug must be retained by the study center under locked storage until drug accountability has been completed.

Once accountability is completed, the Sponsor’s representative will authorize the return of study medication (all used, partially used, and unused vials) to . The completed Drug Accountability and Drug Return/Destruction Record(s) will be returned to the CRO manager . The Investigator’s copy of the Drug Accountability and Drug Return/Destruction Record(s) must document accurately the return of all study drug supplies and be maintained by the pharmacist or des ignee until the study is complete and the database is locked. Records will also include disposition dates and quantities returned to the designated facility. 9.4.6 Study Drug Administration and Timing of Dose for each Subject 9.4.6.1 Description of Clinical Supplies will supply study drug to clinical sites. Ancillary supplies for dosing will be provided by the study site (i.e., infusion bags containing normal saline, infusion administration sets, syringes, needles, alcohol swabs, gauze pads, bandages, and biohazard containers for safe storage of used needles and syringes) . 9.4.6.2 Determination of Dose Volume The volume of study drug to be administered will be determined by the electronic data capture (EDC) system and will be based on the subject’s weight. The first dose will be 10 mg/kg, and subsequent doses will be 20 mg/kg. W eight will be measured on Day 1 and Weeks 12 and 24 during the Treatment Period. The dose on Day 1 may be based on the weight determined at the most recent clinic visit, provided the most recent visit was within the prior 3 weeks. The doses on Week 3 through Week 9 will be based on the weight determined on Day 1. The weight used in the Week 12 dose calculation can be the weight determined on Day 1 or the weight obtained at Week 12. The weight obtained at Week 12 can be used to adjust the dose beginning at Week 12 or Week 15 through Week 21, a s appropriate . 9.4.6.3 Details Concerning Timing and Dose Administration 9.4.6.3.1 Preparation and Administration of Teprotumumab Teprotumumab will be prepared by the site pharmacist or designee in accordance with institutional policy and local regulations . Each vial of teprotumumab will be reconstituted with 10 mL of water for injection. The resulting solution will have an approximate concentration of 50 mg/mL teprotumumab antibody. Reconstituted teprotumumab solution will be further diluted in 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride ( NaCl ) solution prior to administration by the site pharmacist or designee. Doses up to 1800 mg will be administered in a total infusion volume of 100 mL, and those above 1800 mg will be administered in a total infusion volume of 250 mL. To maintain a constant volume in the infusion bags, a volume equal to the volume of teprotumumab to be placed into the infusion bag will be first removed from the in fusion bag using a sterile syringe and needle. The appropriate volume of reconstituted drug product solution based on the subject`s dose and body weight will be withdrawn and the teprotumumab drug product solution will be diluted with normal saline (0.9% N aCl) in the infusion bag."

The diluted product should be used within 4 hours of preparation. However, if not used within 4 hours, and if dilution has taken place under controlled and aseptic conditions, the infusion solution can be stored for up to 24 hours at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). No incompatibilities have been observed with: • administration sets with product contact surface of polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), or polyurethane • inline filters with product contact surf ace of polyether sulphone • IV bags (0.9% sodium chloride) with product contact surface of polyolefin or PVC. In-line filters are not required, but if a hospital is routinely using them, in- line fil ters with a 0.2 μm pore size should be utilized. Exposure of the solution to direct sunlight should be avoided. All parenteral products should be visually inspected for particulates before administration. Partially used vials should not be re- used. The fir st and second IV infusions on Day 1 and Week 3 will be administered over approximately 90 minutes (but not less than 80 minutes) for all subjects; subsequent infusions may be administered over a shorter time period (approximately 60 minutes , but not less t han 50 minutes ) in the absence of any infusion- associated events. All subjects will be monitored for AEs from the start of infusion through 60 minutes after infusion completion for the first 3 doses; the monitoring period for subsequent doses may be reduced to 30 minutes after infusion completion for subjects who do not experience infusion- associated events. 9.4.6.3.2 Dose Modifications, Interruptions, and Delays Subjects will be monitored for immediate infusion- associated events (e.g., nausea, vomiting, facial flush ing, warmth, dyspnea, dizziness, hypertension, hypotension, pruritus ) and delayed infusion- associated events (e.g., rash). If immediate infusion- associated events are noted , the infusion rate will be slowed or interrupted , symptomatic treatment (e .g., antipyretics, antihistamines, beta -agonists, oxygen, IV fluid) will be administered , and vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate) will be monitored every 5 minutes until stable and then every 15 minutes for 2 additional determinations. The infusion may be restarted upon complete resolution of symptoms; however, study drug dosing will be permanently discontinued if the event is an anaphylactic reaction . If delayed infusion- associated event s are noted, subjects may continue dosing at the Investigator's discretion ; however, if a rash worsens following repeated dosing or other signs of serum sickness (e.g., delayed fever, myalgias , arthralgias) are present, study drug dosing will be permanently discontinued."

All subsequent infusions will be administered over approximately 90 minutes (but not less than 80 minutes) with vital signs monitored every 15 minutes from the start of the infusion through 60 minutes after infusion completion. In general, the decision to continue dosing should take into consideration the potential benefit and risk to a subject. Any severe drug- related AE must revert to mild or moderate in intensity at least 2 weeks prior to the next scheduled dose i n order for the dose to be administered; if the AE remains severe in intensity within 2 weeks of the next scheduled dose, the subject will be withdrawn from treatment. Increase in blood glucose is a known AE observed in previous clinical trials with teprot umumab and other IGF -1R antagonists and is known to respond to treatment. Since a referral for treatment of hyperglycemia may take some time, if the I nvestigator considers it appropriate to continue the subject in the study, the next scheduled infusion visit may be skipped to allow modified anti-diabetic treatment to show its activity and hyperglycemia to return to mild/moderate level before dosing. The subject would then be dosed at the next scheduled visit (i.e., 6 weeks after the previous infusion). Fast ing blood glucose levels must return to mild/moderate severity before the next scheduled infusion. The above process of withholding a scheduled infusion will be permitted only twice during the study. Any changes to the scheduled dosing interval (q3W) or adjustments in the infusion rate should be reported to the Sponsor/CRO. 9.4.7 Method of Assigning Subject s to Treatment Groups All subjects will receive teprotumumab in this open -label extension study. 9.4.8 Masking and Unmasking This is an open -label extension study. In order to maintain the study mask in HZNP -TEP-301, all subjects in this open- label extension study will undergo the same dosing regimen of teprotumumab (10 mg/kg on Day 1 followed by 20 mg/kg q3W for the remaining 7 infusions) , regardless if they received teprotumumab or placebo in HZNP -TEP-301. 9.4.9 Concomitant Therapy and Restricted Medications Local supportive measures for TED , simple analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti- inflammatory therapies), and medications/supplements for conditions other than TED are permitted during the study.

The ""study eye"" (i.e., most severely affected eye ) will remain the same as that identified at the Baseline (Day 1) Visit of Study HZNP- TEP-301. Both eyes will be assessed for efficacy but the study eye will be used to assess the primary outcome measure. Efficacy will be assessed by proptosis (measured as exophthalmos evaluation of the Clinical Measures of Severity using a Hertel instrument provided by the Sponsor for consistency in measurement), CAS (7-item scale), diplopia ( measured as part of the Clinical Measures of Severity) and Clinical Measures of Severity (including motility restriction assessments). 9.5.1.1 Proptosis (Exophthalmos) Proptosis assessments will be performed using a Hertel exophthalmometer provided by the Sponsor for consistency in measurement , and (except when strictly unavoidable) the same Hertel instrument and same observer should be used at each evaluation for the full duration of the study. Additionally , the same intercanthal distance (ICD) must be used on ea ch occasion . Instructions for the measurement of proptosis are included in Section 17.2 . Proptosis will be measured for each eye on Day 1 and Weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24 (or premature withdrawal [ PW]) during the Treatment Period, and at Months 7, 9, and 12 (or PW) during the Follow-Up Period. Measurements will be recorded on the Clinical Measures of Severit y eCRF under exophthalmos. 9.5.1.2 Clinical Activity Score (CAS) The CAS will be completed on Day 1 and Weeks 6, 12, 18, and 24 (or PW) during the Treatment Period, and at Months 7, 9 , and 12 (or PW) during the Follow-Up Period using the 7- item European Group on Graves’ Ophthalmopathy (EUGOGO) amended CAS [ Mourits et al, 1989] (Table 9.2)."

Pre-existi ng conditions that worsen during a study are to be reported as AEs. New findings reported from the on-study ophthalmic examinations will not be reported as AEs if according to the Investigator the abnormalities are related to TED and not considered related to the investigational product. Unchanged, chronic conditions are NOT considered AEs and should not be recorded on the AE pages of the eCRF unless there is a clear exacerbation of a chronic condition. Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a subject’s condition attributable to the disease for which the study drug is being studied (i.e., TED). It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and/or increases in the symptoms of the disease. The development of worsening proptosis may be considered as disease progression and not an AE. Events, which are unequivocally due to disease progression, should only be reported as AEs if they fulfill any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the stud y drug. 9.5.4.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Event Definition A TEAE , baseline event, or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: • Death. This includes any death that occurs during the conduct of a clinical study, including deaths that appear to be completely unrelated to the study drug (e.g., car accidents). • Life-threatening adverse experience. An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered life-threatening if, in the view of either the Investigator or the Sponsor, i ts occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. • Persistent or significant disability or incapacity. • Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization. • Congenital anomaly or birth defect. • Other medically important event which, according to appropriate medical judgment, may require medical or sur gical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Surgical procedures or other therapeutic interventions themselves are not AEs, but the condition for which the surgery/intervention is required is an AE and should be documented accordingly. Elective surgeries that require hospitalization and treatment received at an emergency room or similar facility will not be considered as SAEs unless one of the definitions of an SAE listed above is met."

The TEAE reporting period begins with administrat ion of the first dose of study medication on Day 1 and continues until 3 weeks after the last dose of study drug, and the Follow-Up AE reporting period begins 3 weeks after the last dose of study drug through completion of the Follow- Up Period (Month 12 or PW ). All pre-dose AEs, TEAE s, and AEs during the Follow-Up Period must be recorded in the sourc e documents and i n the subject’s e CRF . If the Investigator observes an SAE after study completion that he/she believes was possibly caused by the study medication, the Investigator will report this SAE using the procedures described in Section 9.5.4.1.5. Detailed information regarding all SAEs must also be recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Reporting Form.

Choose a Hertel exophthalmometer provided by the Study Sponsor for consistency in measurement with a snug mechanism and preferably a square angle where it sits against the orbital rim (a). 2. Open it wider than required. 3. Sit opposite the patient and at the same level. 4. Keep the patient relaxed, avoiding breath holding and excessive eyelid retraction. 5. Position left foot of Hertel against the patient’s right lateral orbital rim, at level of lateral canthus (b). It should sit firmly as medially as possible, but outside lateral canthus and without distorting position of globe. 6. Slide right foot medially into identical position on left orbital rim (c). This will feel tight and slightly uncomfortable, but minimizes potential side slippage of Hertel. 7. Ask patient to fix their right eye on your left eye while you occlude the patient’s left visual axis with your right thumb. In this position, align the instrument such that the vertical mark (or cone) is aligned with the manufacturer’s pre -marked position on the ruler. Once aligned, rotate the instrument slightly around the horizontal pl ane such as to view the apex of the cornea in the mirror. Record the position of the corneal apex on the ruler. This is Hertel value. 8. To record the left eye, hold the instrument stationary and move your head. Then use your right eye to record the patients left eye. Again, the opposite visual axis is occluded by your left thumb, while the patient is asked to fix on your right eye. Ensure that the corneal apex is measured by rotating the instrument slightly around the horizontal plane if required."
