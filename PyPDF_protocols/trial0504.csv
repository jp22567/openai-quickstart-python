In meta -regressio n models adjusting for habitation type, response rate, study year and DR diagnostic method, Hispanics (odds ratio [OR], 2.92; 95% CI, 1.22 -6.98) and Middle Easterners (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.51 -3.94) wit h diabetes were mor e likely to have DR, compared t o Asians.2 The major risk factors of DR include disease dura tion, poor glyca emic control, presence of hypertension, higher body mass index, puberty, pregnancy, and cataract surgery. Early detection and trea tment can prevent a ny diabetic -related visual impa irment . To reduce the impact of DR -related visual loss, it i s important to l ook for innovative ways of managing and preventing diabetes and optimize cost -effective screening programs within the community. Diabetic Retinopath y can be clinically characteris ed into a non -proliferative (NPDR) stage and proliferative ( PDR) stage depen ding on the retinal vascular lesions. It can also lead to fluid accumulation in the retina called diabetic macular edema (DME). Visual functions are affected in the ear ly and late stage of the disease. Current research shows that contrast sensitivity is a more sensitive tool to detect early retinal changes than visual acuity. In a recent study contrast sensitivity score was noted to be significantly l ower in diabetic pat ients with no retinopathy and mild nonproliferative retinopathy.5 Cone photoreceptor li ght sensitivity is responsible for light adaptation and rod light sensitivity for dark adaptation and performance. Studies on reti nal neurodegenerati on in DM have report ed abnormal ities of inner -retina structure and function. These include reduced retinal ganglion cell thickness, abnormal ERG patterns i.e., reduced photonic and scotopic response.6Delay in high -frequency flicker ERG a nd reduced cone sen sitivity have been r eported in early cases that can serve as a screening tool. Reduction in pattern ERG, photonic negative response (PhNR) and the post - illumination pupil response (PIPR) have been reported in diabetic patients with and w ithout NPDR.7 Light and dark adapted st eady state pupil size and melanosis mediated pupil light reflex are redu ced in diabetes and all stages of DR.8,9 These proof -of-concept studies demonstrate that chromatic pupilometer methods can serve as a screening a nd early detection tool to assess the d amage to ph otoreceptors of retinal/optic nerve diseases. Dark adaptation is being report ed to be affected in retinal dysfunction conditions such as ARMD, Diabetic Retinopathy and Retinitis Pigmentosa. In addition to t he effect of early DR on cone -mediated light sensi tivity, the second most impaired visual function was rod -medi ated visual sensitivity. These indicate diabetes exerts early impact on the inner and outer retinal function.10 Dark adaptation was measured in N PDR using AdaptDx d ark adaptometer (Mac uLogix, Inc Hummel stown, PA, USA) and the results suggested that RPE and photoreceptor ce ll dysfunction was noted to be progressed with worsening DR and rod recovery dysfunction occurred earlier than cone dysfunction.11 2.1.2: Age-relat ed macular degenerat ion (AMD) is the main cause of adult blindness in the Western world. The prevalence of advanced AMD in two studies were 1,6% and 1,5% respectively, and the incidence of AMD in the population of >75 years of age is si gnificantly"

In developing countries there is little data on the prevalence of the disea se3. In a study fro m India, there is ev idence that AMD m ay exist to the same extent as it does in developed cou ntries. The prev alence of early (dry form) and late (wet form) stages of AMD is like that observed in Western populations. The prevalence in the age of >80 years se ems to be underestim ated 14. In countries with growing elderly populations, it is impo rtant for society to plan for low -vision services and rehabilitation, which implies the need for early detection of AMD. Research states subjects in th e early stages of d ry AMD have delayed dark ad aptation (DA), which indicates a delay of light sensitivity by the photoreceptors (cones and rods), which have been exposed to bright light15-21. The photoreceptors of cones and rods are slowly increasing their sensitivity to lig ht in a dim environm ent. Co nes adapt faster, so the first few minutes of adaptation is related to the cone m oderated vision. Rods adapt slower, but can adapt to dimmer illuminations, and they replace the cone mediated period. The me thod of functionally assessing DA in early d etectio n of dry AMD is described in multiple studies. Patients wit h dry AMD have problem s with their vision under low light conditions. Therefore, the functional sign of early AMD is the lack of the subject’s abi lity to adapt in the dar k after being expose d to light. The rod photoreceptor cells are extremely sensitive an d can be triggered by a single photon 22-23. Cone photoreceptor cells improve sensitivity quickly and recover their total function after 5 to 10 m inute s. There is a trans ition from cone to r od func tion in dark adaptation, and the rod responses to changes i n light level is thoug ht to be slow as the rods take 20 to 40 min to fully recover after the offset of a bright light 24. Although rod recovery is affected in early AMD, cone sensitivity is investi gated also to be an effective index of early AMD detection25-26. To clinically in vestigate the rod adaptation is time consuming for the patient and may last up to 20 to 40 minutes, whereas cone adaptation shoul d not take longer than 1 -2 minutes, as cones t ake up to 2 min to recover in the dark. As both cones and r ods are affected in ea rly AMD, it is more time saving to investigate the cone DA effort. When bleaching the retinal photo pigments exposed to low er li ght levels, there i s an adaptation in t he reti nal neurons fed by the cones. The approximate time for reco very in the dark after moderate light adaptation is said to be ± 15 sec in the blue/yellow pathway27 and ± 20 s in the red/green pathway for the r ecove ry28. It is even sh own that there is a very ra pid adaptation that takes less than 0.6 sec29. AMD usually classifies as “Early” and “Intermediate”. 2.2: BulbiCam BulbiTech AS has developed a hardware/software product combination to simplify neuro - ophth almic examinations.

In case of life-threatenin g AE, SAE or SUSAR occurs, the BCAM registra tion has to stop until the disappearance of the s ymptoms. If possible, treatment of the symptoms will be given in accordance with the hospi tals’ routines. In case of life -threatening AE, SAE or SUSAR occurs at on e of the sites, the other participating site will be informed at once by the study manager. 6.6: Report o f serious adverse effect (SAE) The patient will be advised to con tact the i nvestigator if she/he suffers from severe AE or any other annoy ing condit ions. In case of SAE or SUSAR , the investig ator has to complete the SAE form and send it to the health auth orities . All AE’s will be recorded on relevant forms and their at tribution to study intervention will be evaluated. The severity of the re actions wi ll be recorded along with a brief descriptio n of the event. SAEs and SUSAR will be reported t o health author ities with copy to BulbiTech A/S and the project manager Prof. Stig Larsen by e-mail as soon as possible, but in any case , within 24 hours of the PI ’s knowledge of the event.

Each study partici pants are given a study i dentification number which w ill be stored in the database . The data manag er (DM) and the DM-staff at Meddoc will perform the secondary monitoring on the e -CRFs. Prior to study start, a data entry instruction document will be made. Source data consist of printouts from the laboratory examinations ; baseline characteris tics; clinical examination collected by the investigator and entered by site. In case of missing data or ne ed of clarifi cation, the responsible monitor will conta ct the site. 8.2. Study Database The va lidated data management system InCRF will be used for c ollecting the CRF data. The system selected is compliant with GCP guidelines and subject to 21 CFR (Code of federal regulations) FDA part 11 requirements. The fin al data base will be stored in the Statistical Analysis system (SAS ver. 9.4 or later). 8.3: Da ta handling A data entry person at site will enter the e-CRF data in InCRF and the DM will perform the initial data vali dation. In case of missing data, logical e rrors o r interpretation problems, a query will be generated directly in InCRF. Investigator ca n review the query status via either InCRF function of “Study reports” /” Query report” or patient’s e -Form dashboard . When all the needed participants have final ized th e clinical part, and th e investigator has electronically signed the e-CRFs, the DM will do the final verification checks and perform final database hard-lock when all errors are correct ed. Screening analysi s for logical errors will be evenly perfor med on this database and error s will be corrected after new information is collected from the site. When all the detected errors are corrected, the main basic database will be locked. The data base will be transform ed to a labeled SAS database, which also w ill be locked up to prevent all possible changes or additions. In this copy, the responsible s tatistician can make derivations but no corrections of the data. If corrections are needed, the m ain basic stu dy databas e has to be re -opened and corrected.
