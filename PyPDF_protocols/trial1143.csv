14,page_14,"Clinical Trial Protocol STEMS Rev. n° 1. 2 Page 15 of 54 Rev. date 10 March 2017 3 Introduction: background information and scientific rationale 3.1 Background information Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an acquired inflammatory and neurodegenerative immuno-mediated disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), characterized by inflammation, demyelination and primary or secondary axonal degeneration ( Confavreux & Vukusic, 2006 ). It is a complex mult i- factorial disorder, in which environmental factors are hypothesized to interact with genetically susceptible individuals. Genetic susceptibility plays a role in disease initiation and currently un i- dentified environmental factors are also involved. The prevalence rate of MS varies between races and geographical latitude, ranging from more than 100 cases out of 100,000 in Northern and Central Europe to 50 cases out of 100,000 in Southern Europe. Three major clinical forms of MS are recognized: primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PP- MS), secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SP-MS), and relapsing-remitting multiple sclero- sis (RRMS) ( Confavreux, Vukusic et al., 2000 ). RR-MS and SP-MS are probably different sta g- es of the same disease while PP-MS may imply different processes ( Lublin, Reingold et al., 2014). RR-MS represents the more frequent form of the disease (80-85%). It is characterized by the occurrence of acute episodes of neurological dysfunction named relapses, followed by vari a- ble recovery and periods of clinical stability. The majority of patients who start with RR -MS eventually d evelop SP-MS, 50% at 10 years and 90% at 25 years (Kragt, van der Linden et al., 2006). During the progressive phase subjects develop sustained and progressive clinical deteri o- ration with or without superimposed relapses(Lassmann, 2007a ). PP-MS is mainly characterized by a progressive accumulation of disability since the onset of the disease (Bramow, Frischer et al., 2010, Lassmann, 2007b ). The disease shows heterogeneity with respect to its pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, pro g- nosis and, most interestingly, with respect to its pathology. The essential structural features of MS are focal demyelination associated with inflammation and axonal damage ( Frischer, Bramow e t al., 2009 ). Acute inflammation, present in the early phases of the disease, produces demy e- lination and axonal loss. The etiology of MS is unknown, although an autoimmune process has been implicated. It is h y- pothesized that CNS auto-reactive T cells are stimulated in the peripheral circulation to become active and proliferate. The expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of T cells allows ad- hesion to activated endothelial cells with subsequent migration of T cells into the CNS compar t- ment. These cells upon interacting with CNS myelin antigens again proliferate, and initiate a pro-inflammatory cascade within the brain that results in either target-directed immune damage or bystander damage. Important cellular and humoral elements are T-lymphocytes, macrophages, microglial cells, metalloproteinases and cytokines, including interferon-gamma, and tumor n e- crosis factor (TNF)-alpha. 3.2 The treatment of Progressive Multiple Sclerosis There are currently no approved therapies to slow down or prevent the accumulation of disability that occurs independently of relapses ( Kurtzke, 1983 ). The current standard of care for patients with SP-MS is to use immunomodulatory drugs to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, to provide mental health care for treatment of depression and anxiety, physical therapy to help preserve ambulatory function, and occupational therapy to help adapt to the loss of upper e x- tremity and other functions.

In marked contrast to relapsing forms of MS, the majority of therapeutic clinical studies for pro- gressive MS have failed to show a benefit compared to placebo. Only the European study of in- terferon beta-1b for treatment of relapsing SP-MS (Kappos, 1998 , Kappos, Polman et al., 2001 ) and the MIMS study of mitoxantrone for treatment of relapsing or rapidly worsening MS (in- cluding SP-MS) (Hartung, Gonsette et al., 2002 ) have demonstrated positive results, but they en- rolled subjects that looked a lot more like RRMS than SP-MS. Recently, Ocrelizumab has been demonstrated to induce beneficial effects on PP-MS patients, but without conclusive evidence that they slow down the progression of disability independently of it s effects on the inflammatory processes related to the disease. The poor results of available treatment obtained in SP and PP-MS are related to the fact that they are effective in the early in- flammatory phase of MS, whereas they have a very poor impact on disease course during the progressive phase when inflammation fades and neurodegeneration leads to disability. A poss i- ble explanation is that other mechanisms, in part independent from early inflammation mainly mediated by cells of the acquired immunity ( Magliozzi, Howell et al., 2007 , Serafini, Rosicarelli et al., 2004 ), may lead to neurodegeneration ( Lassmann, 2007a ); this could arise from an exhau s- tion of the properties of self-repair by local precursors cells harmed by chronic inflammation and consequent degeneration of axons and neural cells. The lack of efficacious treatments for these patients is indicative of the high unmet need for e f- fective alternative therapeutically strategies with different mechanisms of action to manage the irreversible progression of disability. 3.3 Somatic Neural stem precursor cells Somatic neural stem/precursor cells (NPCs) represent a heterogeneous population of mito tically- active, self-renewing and multipotent cells of both the developing and the adult CNS showing complex patterns of gene expression that may vary both in space and time (Temple, 2001 ). Neu- ral stem/precursor cells can be isolated and established as growth factor-dependent ‘virtually perpetual’ cell lines from both the developing and adult human CNS, the subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampal regions of the adult mammalian brain being found to harbor undifferen- tiated neural cells which proliferate in vitro in response to rh-bFGF and rh-EGF and in many ways appear similar to their embryonic counterparts. In defined-medium growth condition, these cells can be grown in vitro for long periods of time, while retaining the potential to differentiate into post-mitotic daughter neural cells. There is still much debate over how to classify these germinal cells – whether they are stem cells, progenitors or pre cursors – particularly when they are removed from the developing or adult CNS and grown in vit ro. A number of papers confirm that cells derived from the embryonic (fetal) human CNS can be isolated and cloned in culture and grown for extended periods of time in vitro. These cells display extensive self-renewal capacity and functional stability, ability to maintain a steady growth profile over time, multipotency, and a constant potential for neuronal and glial different i- ation over years of continuous in vitro culturing. Human NPCs are also cryopreservable and in- corporate into the developing and adult rodent CNS. Tumor formation is not observed, even when human NPCs are transplanted into immuno-deficient hosts ( Garitaonandia, Gonzalez et al., 2016, Mazzini, Gelati et al., 2015 , Pluchino, Gritti et al., 2009 ). As a consequence of their inherent biology, human NPCs from fetal human CNS can establish stable, transplantable non-immortalized cell lines in vitro by epigenetic stimulation ( Vescovi, P arati et al., 1999 ). In particular, due to their capability to generate in vitro large numbers of cells in standardized and quality-controlled preparations, these lines enable the development of clin i- cal strategy of neural transplantation ( Martino, Franklin et al., 2010 ) ."
16,page_16,"Clinical Trial Protocol STEMS Rev. n° 1. 2 Page 17 of 54 Rev. date 10 March 2017 3.4 Rationale of NPCs for the treatment of MS Inflammation and degeneration are the prototypical pathological processes promoting irrevers i- ble tissue damage and clinical disability in CNS disorders. To prevent irreversible tissue damage, the CNS has evolutionarily developed a series of molecular and cellular mechanisms of repair that a re activated in response to chronic inflammation and neurodegeneration. Endogenous so- matic neural stem/precursor cells (NPCs) – the self-renewing and multipotent cells of the CNS ca pable of driving neurogenesis and gliogenesis in adult life – migrate into damaged areas to promote functional and structural tissue repair. However, reactive innate ‘protective’ CNS mechanisms are not robust enough to promote the full recovery of the cytoarchitecture of the damaged CNS. In order to foster and reset such mechanisms, NPC transplantation strategies have been developed and may represent one of the possible and most promising approaches to generate new therapeutic options for still incurable chronic neurological disorders. Several preclinical and clinical studies using cells obtained eithe r from embryonic, fetal or adult tissues are already available ( Chen, Sakowski et al., 2016 , Chu, Kim et al., 2003 , Feldman, Bou- lis et al., 2014 , Jeong, Chu et al., 2003 , Park, Teng et al., 2002 ). Altogether, these studies ind i- cate that transplantation of NPCs is nowadays promising based on the ability of transplanted NPCs to adapt their behavior and fate to the CNS microenvironment and to promote neuropro- tection via different and articulated strategies ( Pluchino, Zanotti et al., 2005a ). Despite the initial perception that transplantation of NPCs could only serve to replace the lost cells, recent exper i- mental studies have shown that transplanted NPCs could also exert additional neuroprotective, as well as immunomodulatory, “bystander” effects capable of promoting tissue repair by preventing tissue damage, interfering with the pathogenic process, or rescuing endogenous neural cells (Muller, Snyder et al., 2006 ). Thus, NPCs transplantation might represent an ideal therapeutic strategy also in neurological disorders characterized by neurodegenerative processes secondary to inflammation as MS. The “bystander” effect is a multistep process depending on the timing of cell injection and the route of cell transplantation. Once injected intraparenchymally or system i- cally [intravenously (i.v.) or intrathecally (i.t.)], NPCs show a certain degree of pathotropism (i.e. mig ration and homing to pathological sites) ( Aboody, Brown et al., 2000 ). Upon migration into inflamed CNS areas, transplanted NPCs survive in close proximity to blood vessels where they interact with CNS-infiltrating blood borne inflammatory cells, endothelial cells and CNS- resident astrocytes and microglia. Within perivascular areas, these latter cell populations secrete a series of molecules that are capable, on one hand, to recapitulate the microenvironment of the prototypical S VZ germinal niche, and, on the other hand, to inhibit the NPC cell cycle by upre g- ulating the expression of cell cycle-dependent kinase inhibitors. As a consequence of these cell u- lar interactions, transplanted NPCs retain an undifferentiated phenotype forming an atypical e c- topic perivascular niche. There, undifferentiated NPCs continue to express and produce a wide arr ay of constitutive transmembran al and secreted molecules that, in turn, promote tissue repair through immunomodulation and stimulation of endogenous reparative mechanisms (e.g. trophic support, ce llular plasticity) ( Lu, Jones et al., 2003 ). In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, intrathecal (i.t.) or intravenous (i.v.) transplantation of NPCs inhibits T-cell proliferation and promotes the apop- tosis of encephalitogenic CNS-infiltrating T cells ( Einstein, Karussis et al., 2003 , Pluchino, Quattrini et al., 2003 , Pluchino, Zanotti et al., 2005b ). Similarly to other stem cell types (i.e. mesenchymal stem cells), NPCs can exert a bystander immunomodulatory effects also outside the CNS upon systemic transplantation. Indeed, in EAE mice, i.v. injected NPCs may also inhibit the ini tiation and maintenance of the inflammatory events occurring within the secondary ly m- phoid organs. The immunomodulatory properties of NPCs seem to be a constitutive and evolu-"
17,page_17,"Clinical Trial Protocol STEMS Rev. n° 1. 2 Page 18 of 54 Rev. date 10 March 2017 tionarily conserved signature. Indeed, fetal human NPCs constitutively express a consid erable amount of immune related genes (around 18% of the total number of expressed genes) and inhib- it T-lymphocyte proliferation as well as dendritic cell maturation in vitro. Indeed, in nonhuman primates with EAE, systemically transplanted fetal human NPCs ameliorate disease severity, while persisting long-term within the host CNS and in the draining lymph nodes. NPCs also have the ability to stimulate endogenous reparative mechanisms. This effect is mainly attributed to the capacity of undifferentiated NPCs to secrete a plethora of trophic factors able to protect and pr e- vent neural cell damage and to re-establish the functional interactions between neural and glial cells. In animal models of both MS and spinal cord injury (SCI) ( Fujiwara, Tanaka et al., 2004 ), enhanced endogenous remyelination following NPC transplantation has been consistently repor t- ed (Pluchino, Furlan et al., 2004 ). In diseases in which the stem cell-mediated bystander effect is desirable – for example, diseases characterized by primary inflammation (MS, SCI and ischemic stroke) – we still need to unde r- stand how to optimize the treatment in order to avoid unwanted side-effects. This is particularly true in diseases such as MS, in which repeated inflammatory insults determine the coexistence of variable proportions of both neurodegenerative and regenerative processes. As recently sugges t- ed, treatment optimization might be achieved by tightly controlling the timing and route of cell administration. An early time-window for NPC transplantation seems to be the most appropriate approach, as the expression of genes coding for molecules supporting tissue growth predom i- nates over genes coding for molecules exerting an antiplasticity effect occurring soon after CNS damage. Concerning the administration route, orthotopic transplantation should be preferred as recent d a- ta indicate that NPCs – but also other sources of somatic stem cells (i.e. BMSCs) – might form tumors , in response to microenvironment mediated signals, when implanted in heterotopic ti s- sues (Melzi, Antonioli et al., 2010 ). 3.5 Rationale of first dose of NPCs for the treatment of MS The number of cells to be injected into patients via lumbar puncture has been chos en according to the data obtained in the preclinical trial we conducted in non human primates ( Pluchino et al., 2009). The maximal dose of cells intracisternally injected in non human primates was 5x106/kg cells per animal. This is the very same maximal dose we will reach in humans, as we will start our dose escalating protocol from 0.7x106/kg cells per patient and, if no side effects will be re c- orde d, we will proceed up to 5.7x106/kg cells per patients. 3.6 Risk benefit assessment 3.6.1 Risk benefit definitions Risk is defined as the probability of physical, psychological, social, or economic harm occurring as a result of participation in a research study. Both the probability and magnitude of possible harm in human research may vary from minimal to considerable. Minimal risk exists where the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the proposed research are not greater, in and of themselves, than those ordinarily encountered in da i- ly life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests. Risk above this standard is more than minimal (moderate, maximal) and that imposes limitations on the conduct of the research and increases the requirements for monitoring. It also requires more stringent approval processes when studying children or otherwise vulnerable populations. Increased risk should be accompanied by the probability of appropriately increased benefits."
18,page_18,"Clinical Trial Protocol STEMS Rev. n° 1. 2 Page 19 of 54 Rev. date 10 March 2017 Benefit applies to the potential of the research treatment to ameliorate a condition or treat a di s- ease. This can apply to an individual participant or to a population. In research as in clinical medicine, results cannot be guaranteed but, as a consequence of prior work, a benefit may appear to be a reasonable expectation. Since this is research, an advantage for the treatment groups can- not be presupposed. Since the risks have not been fully evaluated, a statement of individual ben e- fit should be made most cautiously if at all. The investigator should always distinguish between research and treatment and never lure the patient into participating in hopes of remission or cure. 3.6.2 Risk benefit ratio The final goal of this study and future studies is to develop a curative treatment which can be offered to any patient affected by Progressive MS . The proposed clinical trial is designed to a p- propriately assess the safety of the ATIMP and applied pr ocedures. The potential risks associated to the use of a novel technology and a reduced toxicity of immunosuppresion regimen are well balanced by the potential benefit of a potentially curative therapy for patients to whom cannot be offered therapeutic opt ions. 3.6.2.1 Benefit This approach might represent one of the first cell-based therapy promoting neuroprotection in diseases in which neurodegeneration is the final outcome of the tissue pathology. This is because, despite the initial perception that transplantation of NPCs could only serve to replace the lost cells, recent experimental studies from our own and other groups have shown that transplanted NPCs could also exert additional neuroprotective, as well as immunomodulatory, bystander e f- fects capable of promoting tissue repair by preventing tissue damage, interfering with the patho- genic process, or rescuing endogenous neural cells ( Kokaia et al., 2012 ). As a matter of fact, such results do support the concept that somatic stem cells might promote CNS repair via several and articulated strategies in inflammatory and degenerative disorders such as MS (see Figure 2). Figure 2 – Benefit assessment"
19,page_19,"Clinical Trial Protocol STEMS Rev. n° 1. 2 Page 20 of 54 Rev. date 10 March 2017 Transplanted NPCs adapt their fate and function(s) to specific environmental needs occurring as a re sult of different pathological conditions and therefore are capable of supporting neuroprote c- tion not only by promoting cell replacement but also via the so-called bystander effect that is mainly aimed at rescuing endogenous neural cells. The bystander effect is made possible by the fac t that NPCs sense the inflammatory environment (pathotropism) and, within such an env i- ronment, promote tissue homeostasis and repair by releasing, at the site of tissue damage (ectop- ic atypical perivascular niche), a milieu of constitutively expressed molecules capable of i m- munomodulation and trophic support. The net and final effect is neuroprotection because tran s- planted NPCs not only rescue damaged cells but also promote cellular and molecular plasticity. Thus, NPC transplantation might represent an ideal therapeutic strategy also in neurological di s- orders characterized by multifocal and diffuse inflammatory and degenerative processes caused by the maladaptive interactions among different cell types 3.6.2.2 Risk The risks the patients enrolled in the trial can be subjected to might be due to: (1) the pr ocedure of cell injection per se (discussed in details other sections of this project); (2) a llergic reactions to the medicinal product (discussed in details other sections of this project); (3) infections due the non sterility of the cell product: this risk has been very much minimized by the extensive in vitro examinations of the medicinal product we performed (see IMPD); (4) tumor formation: this risk has been minimized by the in vivo extensive assessment we have performed using supra maximal doses of cells infused in immunosuppressed mice (see preclin i- cal in vivo toxicy data). 3.6.2.3 R atio In conclusions, while the risk patients enrolled in the trial can be subjected to the risks that we usually take when we explore a new potential therapy, the benefits might overtly overcome the risks since the therapeutic approach we are proposing might represent one of the very first – if not the first - neuroprotetective therapies for conditions in which neurodegeneration is due to neuroinflammation, i.e. progressive MS patients. Moreover, if efficacious such therapy might also represent an approach to treat several other ne u- rodegenerative/neuroinflammatory CNS disorders such as stroke and spinal cord injury."

However, two phase I trials and one phase II trial have been performed in adult patients affected by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclero- sis and other two phase I trials have been performed in children affected by neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. The total number of patients exposed to hNPCs are 42. In all these studies a surgical injection of stem cell directly in the brain or the spinal cord was performed. Overall no side effects or adverse events related to hNPCs were r e- ported. Also anatomo-pathological studies conducted in subjects who died during the follow-up of the previous studies for the underlying disease confirmed the feasibility and the therapeu tic potential of this treatment. Preclinical studies in non-human primates with hNPCs did not shown any saf ety issue. The safety profile will be monitored from the baseline visit to the last follow-up visit. The SHORT TERM safety profile will be evaluated trough: - Vital signs : During the injection of hNPCs vital signs including oxygen saturation will be mo n- itored before and then after 15 minutes, 60’ and 3 hours after the end of injection. Vital signs will be then monitored before discharge. Particularly, during the treatment visit acute injection toxicity and allergic reactions will be monitored, and it will be defined as any of the following events within three hours post inje c- tion: - Systolic blood pressure (mmHg) <90 or >180, or >33% decrease or increase from baseline - Diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) <50 or >100, or >33% decrease or increase from baseline - Heart rate: <60 or >33% decrease; >110 or >33% increase - Oxygen saturation: hypoxia (grade ≥2 according to CTCAE) - Body temperature (°C) >37.5°C or >1°C increase - Any other toxic side effect (according to CTCAE) - Physical examination will be performed before the hNPCs injection and before the discharge of the patient. - Neurological examination will be performed before the hNPCs injection and before the di s- charge of the patient. All new or worsening neurological signs and symptoms will be monitored, evaluated and re c- orded. In the presence of newly identified or worsening of neurological sign or symptom the in- vestigator should assess whether the patient is experience a relapse of MS or another neurolog i- cal (non-MS related) disorder. - Cerebrospinal fluid examination (CSF): a CSF examination will be performed in concomitance with hNPCs administration. - Routine Clinical Laboratory tests will be performed before the hNPCs injection and before the discharge of the patient (see appendix for detailed tests).

An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investig a- tional) product. In this protocol the follow AEs (not related to the IMP) are expected: AEs related to the use of tacrolimus: The most common adverse events reported with use of tacrolimus are listed below. Nervous System: very common (frequency >10) : headache and tremors. Common (> 1:100 < 1/10): paresthesias or dysesthesias mental status changes, seizures, encephalopathy, dizziness, impaired writing, and peripheral neuropathy. Late neurotoxicity was highly associated with s e- vere infections and multi-organ failure. Respiratory System: common: pleural effusion, dyspnea, lung disorders, cough, pharyngitis rh i- nitis and sinusitis. Renal System: very common: renal function impairment; common: renal insufficiency acute r e- nal failure oliguria, nephrotoxicity, kidney tubular necrosis, urinary disturbances. Psychiatric Symptoms: very common: insomnia; common: nightmares, depression, irritability, agitation, anxiety, hallucinations, abnormal dreams. Immunologic System: Immunologic side effects have included infectious complications as a r e- sult of immunosuppression. Cytomegalovirus is the most frequently encountered viral pathogen in patients treated with tacrolimus. Bacterial infections, primarily gram-positive and gram- negative aerobes, and fungal infections are also encountered. Progressive multifocal leu- koencephalopathy (PML) related to a JC virus infections have been reported. Hematologic System: common: anemia, leukopenia, leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia hematocrit alterations. Cardiovascular system: very common: hypertension; common: tachycardia hemorrhage, my o- cardial infarction, thrombosis, hypotension, phlebitis. Gastrointestinal system: very common: diarrhea, nausea; common: elevations in liver function tests cholangitis cholestatic jaundice hepatitis gastrointestinal hemorrhage stomatitis, gastroin- testinal perforation. Metabolic adverse events: very common: hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus; common: hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hyperlipidemia, acidosis, hypocalcemia, hypopho s- phatemia, hyponatremia, anorexia. Oncologic adverse events: in one study of 936 transplant patients receiving tacrolimus as prim a- ry immunosuppressive therapy, post transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) occurred in 15 (1.6%) patients. Serologic evidence of Epstein-Barr virus infections was found in all 15 p a- tients. Oncologic side effects, or the development of new malignancies, are of particular concern"
25,page_25,"Clinical Trial Protocol STEMS Rev. n° 1. 2 Page 26 of 54 Rev. date 10 March 2017 in post transplant patients. Lymphoproliferative disorders are most commonly encountered. Lymphadenopathy and monoclonal and polyclonal B cell hyperplasia as well as malignant, often fatal, B cell lymphomas have been reported. Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity side effects including allergic reaction have been reported infrequently. AEs related to chronic steroids treatment methylprednisolone and prednisone: Expected AEs include: systemic hypertension; glaucoma; fluid retention; hyperglycemia and d i- abetes; mood and emotional disorders, central obesity; osteoporosis; cataracts; increased risk of infections; suppressed adrenal gland hormone production; thin skin, easy bruising and slower wound healing. AEs related to lumbar puncture and injection procedure: Lumbar puncture: is a minimally invasive , diagnostic or therapeutic procedure that involves the removal of a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) - the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord - followed by the injection of neural cells into the lumbar region of the spinal co l- umn. In this study, the quantity of collected CSF will be replaced by the same amount of cell cu l- ture medium. The most frequent adverse events related to this procedure is the orthostatic headache and/or back pain. The frequency of these events is about 15-30%. Normally they resolve in few days and they can be treated with bed rest, anti-inflammatory drugs and hydration. The injection of any substance in the spinal canal could induce an inflammatory/irritative reaction with highly variable severity and duration of the AE. This kind of reaction is unpredictable. Overall, rare adverse events (<1%) are related to the simple Lumbar Puncture Procedure and consist in: risk of infection; risk of bleeding ( epidural or subdural hematoma ); risk of cranial nerve palsy and cauda equina syndrome; hypotension, bradycardia with or without syncope. Infective Complication due to Immunosuppressive treatments To address the risk of opportunistic infections and organ toxicity due to combined steroid and tacrolimus treatment, periodic clinical, biochemical (full blood count, renal and liver function) drug level (FK506), immunological and virological monitoring (PCR for cytomegalovirus- CMV and Epstein virus-EBV) will be instituted at fixed intervals (see details in the specific chapter) and depending on patient’s clinical and biochemical condition and previous findings, for the entire duration of the immunosuppressive treatment. Pre-emptive CMV reactivation will be treated by standard treatment for immunosuppressed pati ents (i.e. ganciclovir or foscarnet). Immunosuppression reduction or discontinuation can be consi dered depending on severity. EBV reactivation will be treated with immunosuppressive drug reduction or discontinuation and/or anti-CD20 (Rituximab) depending on the copy level and patient’s clinical condition. Recurrent episodes of CMV reactivation will be addressed with reduction of the immunosup- pressive drug tacrolimus. Immunosuppression discontinuation will be considered depending on severity. Bacterial infection will be treated according to standards. Repeated infections will be ad- dressed by reduction or discontinuation of immunosuppression depending on site of infection, seve rity and patient’s condition."

The relationship in time is very suggestive (e.g., it is confirmed by de-challenge and re-challenge). 5.5.4 Serious adverse event (SAE) or Serious Adverse Reaction (Serious ADR) SAE or SAR: any untoward expected medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, r e- sults in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly or birth d e- fect. 5.5.5 Unexpected adverse reaction (UAR) UAR: an adverse reaction, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (e.g. investigator’s brochure for an unauthorised investigational product or summary of product characteristics for an authorised product). 5.5.6 Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) SUSAR: an adverse event assessed as serious and unexpected and for which there is a reason a- ble suspected causal relationship with an investigational medical product. 5.5.7 Pharmacovigilance Procedure Serious Adverse Event: The Investigator shall report all SAE immediately to the Sponsor and Ethics Committee. The Investigator must fill the SAE report no later than 15 days. For reported deaths of a subject, the Investigator shall supply the Sponsor and Ethics Committee with any ad- ditional information requested. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR): In case of a Serious ADR that is unexpected, the Investigator/Sponsor must report the reaction as soon as possible (and in any case no later than 7 days for reactions that are fatal or life-threatening, and no later than 15 days for all other SUSARs) to the competent Regulatory Authorities and to the competent Ethics Committee (and that relevant follow-up information is subsequently communicated within an additional eight days). Periodic reporting : Once a year throughout the trial, the Investigator should provide to Comp e- tent Regulatory Authorities and the Ethics Committee an Annual Safety Report, that is, a listing of all suspected Serious ADRs, which have occurred over this period and a report of the sub- jects’ safety. Adverse event recording : All AEs/ADRs regardless of seriousness or relationship to Medicinal Product or expectedness are to be recorded on the corresponding page(s) included in the Case Report Form. Whenever possible, symptoms should be group as a single syndrome or diagnosis. The Investigator should specify the date of onset, maximal intensity, action taken with respect to"
28,page_28,"Clinical Trial Protocol STEMS Rev. n° 1. 2 Page 29 of 54 Rev. date 10 March 2017 Medicinal Product, corrective therapy given, outcome and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the event was caused by the study Medicinal Product . The investigator shall keep detailed records of all adverse events, which are reported. These r e- ports must be provided to the competent Authorities if they so request. 5.5.8 Follow-up of AE / SAE / ADR The Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the patients, not a- bly he/she should follow up the outcome of any event (clinical signs, laboratory values or other , etc.) until the return to normal or until consolidation of patient conditions. In the case of any Serious Adverse Event or Serious Adverse Drug Reaction , the patient must be followed up until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized. This may imply that follow-up will continue after the patient left the study and if the Ethical Committee requests additional investigations. 5.5.9 Pregnancy Pregnant and lactating women will not be included in the study. Females must have a negative pregnancy test prior to be included in the study and will be required to use a reliable and effe c- tive form of birth control during the study. Male participants will also be required to prevent pregnancy in their partners. The birth control methods which may considered effective are: a b- stine nce, oral contraceptives either combined hormonal or progestogen alone, injectable proge s- togen, subcutaneous contraceptive implants of etonogestrel or levonorgestrel, estrogenic vaginal ring, percutaneous contraceptive patches, intrauterine device or system (IUD) that has a certified failure rate less than 1% per year, male partner sterilization only with the declaration that he is the sole partner, male condoms combined with a female diaphragm either with or without a va g- inal spermicide. The birth control methods which are considered unacceptable in clinical trials are: periodic ab- stinence (calendar, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), sper micides only, and lactational amenorrhoea method (LAM).For information refer to guid e- lines http://www.hma.eu/fileadmin/dateien/Human_Medicines/01 About_HMA/Working_Groups/CTFG/2014_09_HMA_CTFG_Contraception.pdf At every study visit the sexual activity of participants of reproductive age will be re-assessed. If a subject who was previously sexually inactive becomes sexually active, s/he will be counseled about the need to use a reliable and effective form of birth control. Female subjects of childbea r- ing potential will also be required to undergo pregnancy tests at regular intervals, including and espe cially prior to hNPCs administration. Women who had a positive pregnancy test will not treated with hNPCs. All pregnancies that are identified during the study must be followed to conclusion and the ou t- come of each must be reported. The investigator should be informed immediately of any pre g- nancy whether occurring in a female participant or the female partner of a male participant. The investigator should report all pregnancies to Sponsor within the same timeframe (24 hours) as SAEs, using the SAE report form. Monitoring of the participant should continue until the con- clusion of the pregnancy, and a follow-up SAE report form detailing the outcome of the pre g- nancy should be submitted to the Sponsor. 5.6 Research criteria In order to gather preliminary information on the efficacy of the experimental treatment clinical and MRI parameters will be recorded throughout the study."
29,page_29,"Clinical Trial Protocol STEMS Rev. n° 1. 2 Page 30 of 54 Rev. date 10 March 2017 We will evaluate: - the proportion of disability progression-free patients at week 96; - the longitudinal changes from baseline to visit week 96 in T25FW, 9-HPT, SDMT Disabil ity in MS is commonly measured by the Expanded Disabil ity Status Scale (EDSS). The EDSS is based on a standard neur ological examination, incorporating seven functional systems (visual, pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel and bladder and cerebral) rated and stored as functional system scores (FSS) . Each FSS is and ordinal clinical rating scale ranging from 0 to 5 or 6. These ratings are then used in combination with ambulation capacity to dete r- mine the EDSS score that ranges from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). Sustained disability progression is defined as an increase of > 0.5 EDSS points in the last 12 months. This change has not to be attributable to another etiology (i.e. fever, concurrent illness, MS relapse or concomitant medication) and has to be confirmed at a regularly scheduled visit afte r at least 12 weeks after the initial disease progression. Brain MRI parameters: MRI is a useful tool for monitoring MS lesions. Different MRI derived parameters are used to assess paraclinical evidence of drug efficacy. The following MRI parameters will be evaluated to address the research objective: - brain and spinal cord atrophy as defined by percentage in brain and spinal cord volume change from baseline to week 96; - number of new T2 brain and number of spinal cord lesions and changes in T2 lesion volume at week 96; - number of new T1 hypointense lesions and changes in T1 hypointense lesion volume between baseline and week 96; - total Gd-enhancing lesions in the brain and spinal cord MRI between baseline and week 96; - other MR parameters including thalamic, cortical, white matter and normal appearing brain ti s- sue average magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) – ancillary sub-study-. - Multimodal Evoked Potentials are useful for the evaluation of sensory, motor and visual pathways; Motor Evoked Potentials (MEP), Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP) and Sensory Evoked Potentials (SEP) will be performed at screening, at six and 12 months fo llow-up and then at two years follow -up (week 24, 48 and 96). We will evaluate changes in amplitude and velocity condu ction of MEP, SEP an d VEP between the baseline and week 96. - Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a useful tool, especially in the field of research, to measure retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness as a marker of axonal loss and to detect neurodegeneration in vivo and in a non-invasive way. OCT will be pe rformed at screening, at six and 12 month s follow-up and then at two years follow -up (week 24, 48 and 96). We will evaluate RNFL thickness changes be tween the baseline and week 96. - to determine immune response in patients treated during immunosuppressive therapy with FK506, cellular and humoral immunological assays will be performed. Immune reconstitution by PB immunophenotyping (lymphocyte subpopulations) will be obtained on blood at screening, at weeks 4th, 12th, 24th, 48th and 96th. - We will collect data on donor-recipient chimerism on blood samples and CSF (approximately at screening, at weeks 4th and 12th; further evaluations only if clinically useful) with ddPCR a s- says. It will be performed using the Bio-Rad QX100 system. - A dosage of tacrolimus on CSF will be performed at week 12th to collect data of CNS drug d e- livery."

The patients may withdraw from the study, if they decide to do so, at any time and for any re a- son. Patients who have been withdrawn from the study cannot be re-included in the trial. 6.3.1 Follow-up procedure for withdrawn patients All withdrawn patients should be recorded by the Investigator in the appropriate pages of the CRF when considered as confirmed. If possible, the patients should be assessed using the proc e- dure planned for the end of study visit. If an event causing dropout corresponds to the definition of a Serious AE/ADR, the investigator carries out the pharmacovigilance procedure described. For patients considered lost to follow-up, the CRF must be filled in up to the last visit performed. The Investigator should make every effort to re-contact and to identify the reason why the p a- tient failed to attend the visit and to determine his/her health status. In case of death autopsy will be strongly encouraged for evaluation of pathology and presence of transplanted cells. 6.3.1.1 Natural study termination At the end of total follow-up. 6.3.1.2 Premature Termination or Suspension of study This study may be temporarily suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reason- able cause or if any of the stopping criteria described in this protocol occurs. Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to participants;  demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping;  insufficient compliance to protocol requirements;  data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable;  determination of futility;  reconsideration of the risk/benefit ratio.

32,page_32,"Clinical Trial Protocol STEMS Rev. n° 1. 2 Page 33 of 54 Rev. date 10 March 2017 7 Treatment Plan 7.1 Experimental Treatment/Drug The protocol will consist of a total of four treatment cohorts (TC), labeled from A to D, each of which receiving a single escalating dose of allogenic hNPCs injected intrathecally, as it follows: - TC-A: 0.7x106 ± 10% cells/kg of body weight; - TC-B: 1.4x106 ± 10% cells/kg of body weight; - TC-C: 2.8x106 ± 10% cells/kg of body weight; - TC-D: 5.7x106 ± 10% cells/kg of body weight. The intrathecal injection of hNPCs will be performed in a hospitalized setting. The patients will be left in Trendelenburg position for about 30 minutes and monitored for at least 24 hours. All patients will receive normal saline solution (500 cc). Body temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation will be measured at baseline and after 15, 60, 180 minutes and then before discharge. Any toxicity will be treated at the di s- cretion of the attending neurologist. All patients will receive an i.v. dose of methylprednisolone (125 mg) immediately prior to lu m- bar puncture. The injections of cells will be performed with lumbar puncture in lateral decubitus position r e- moving about 10 cc of CSF that will be used for chemical-physical, infectivological analysis and OBs/ BBB analysis. 2 CSF ml will be stored for further research analysis. CSF will be replaced with the 10 cc of suspension solution containing hNPCs (at 2 ml/min injection rate). The injec- ti on of stem cell will be performed in about 5 minutes. In case of traumatic lumbar puncture with hae matic CSF, the injection of hNPCs will not be performed. A second attempt will be pe r- formed after 15 ± 3 days. 7.2 Immunosuppression: Human NPCs have been shown to be relatively low immunogenic (e.g., no expression of MHC- I molecules and low levels of MHC-II molecules). However, as they are human in origin their transplantation will be handled like other organ transplant in order to prevent the unexpected r e- jection (if any) of transplanted hNPCs and we have planned to put our patients on long term i m- mune suppression. The immunosuppression will be applied in agreement with previous studies with hNPCs in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and in children affected by neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis and and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. In all these studies the patients a long las t- ing immunosuppression was applied in order to guarantee the engraftment of stem cell. Data d e- riving by these studies confirmed that immunosuppression was well tolerated by the majority of patients and no opportunistic infections were reported till now. According to our hematologist guidelines the patients will receive and oral prednisolone as explained below. Tacrolimus (FK506) is a macrolide lactone with potent immunosuppressive activity 100 times that of cyclosporine by weight. The molecular mechanism of action is mediated via an inhibition of the phosphorylase activity of calcineurin by drug-immunophilin complex, resulting in the in- hibition of IL-2 gene expression. There are many studies now showing significant efficacy of tacrolimus in GVHD prevention in both allogeneic HSCT. FK506: The initial oral dose of tacrolimus will be 0.05 mg/kg twice daily from day-7. Tacroli- mus, if tolerated, will be given and gradually t apered till week 96."
33,page_33,"Clinical Trial Protocol STEMS Rev. n° 1. 2 Page 34 of 54 Rev. date 10 March 2017 A pharmacological surveillance of FK506 through drug level for consequent dose adjustment will be performed. In order to maintain a target of 5-10 ng/ml, whole blood levels of tacrolimus will be obtained: - two ti mes a week until the therapeutic range was reached (first samples on day -4 and day -1); - wee kly till week 4 after hNPCs injection; - at week 8, 12, 24, 36, 48 and then every 24 weeks till the end of follow-up. Tac rolimus will be started da y -7 before hNPCs injection as immunosuppressive medication to prevent the rejection of the cells, and it is expected that the patients will take the drug for the end of the follow -up. Dose modifications of tacrolimus were dependent primarily on serum creatinine and the blood levels of tacrolimus. A dose reduction of at least 25% was mandatory for patients with a creat i- nine elevated to greater than 2.0 times baseline and at least a 50% reduction for patients with a creatinine greater than 3 times baseline. Oral prednisone (deltacortene) 50 mg tapering of 5 mg every five days as follows dosage: 37,5 mg, 25mg, 12,5 mg and 5 mg. Any or all the immunosuppressive agents may be reduced or stop at the discretion of the invest i- gator if it is suspected or determined that the immunosuppressive agent is the cause of toxicity and if symptoms cannot be managed adequately with symptomatic treatment. Anti-infective prophylaxis will be administered for the duration of FK506/tacrolimus therapy with acyclovir (1 tablet-800 mg twice daily), and co-trimoxazole (1 tablet-800 mg/160 mg, three times/week. Folic acid (1 tablet of 5 mg) will be administered with co-trimoxazole, as supportive therapy to reduce co-trimoxazole myelotoxicity three times a week. 7.3 Advanced Therapy Investigastional Medicinal Product definition The Drug Product (DP) can be classified as an Advanced Therapy Investigastional Medicinal Product (ATIMP) belonging to the class of Cell Therapy Medicinal Products. The following definitions shall apply throughout this study. The Starting Materials is the Master Cell Bank (MCB) originated from cryopreserved non- immortalized human fetal neural precursor cells (hNPCs) BI-0194-008 cell line obtained from a single 10-12 weeks post-conception (wpc) human fetus and manufactured as defined in the In- vestigastional Medicinal Product Dossier (IMPD). The Drug Substance (DS) will consist of Working Cell Bank (WCB) obtained after expansion of MCB as defined in IMPD. The DP will be constituted by thawed WCB-hNPCs re-suspended in their final formulation m e- dium as defined in IMPD. Medicinal product manufacturing and release will be performed at “Laboratorio di Terapia Ce l- lulare e Genica Stefano Verri - ASST - Monza, Ospedale San Gerardo” (later also “Laboratorio Verri”), as described in the IMPD. Production will be performed according to GMP (Good Man- ufacturing Practice) certified facility authorized by Italian Ministry of Health according to D.L.vo 166/2003 for the production of sterile medicinal products, the production of specific m e-"
34,page_34,"Clinical Trial Protocol STEMS Rev. n° 1. 2 Page 35 of 54 Rev. date 10 March 2017 dicinal products obtained with particular technologies (i.e. cell therapy), and for primary packa g- ing operations. 7.4 Preparation of the drug product When a new patient, enrolled in the clinical protocol, is ready for treatment, cryopreserved WCB vials will be thawed. Freezing medium will be discarded and cells re-suspended in 10 ml of in- jecti on medium and transferred to primary package(s). 7.5 ATIMP packaging and labelling The Medicinal Product will be labelled with a unique identification code of the patient and of the product, released by Laboratorio di Terapia Cellulare e Genica Stefano Verri, according to cGMP. 7.6 ATIMP supply, storage and accountability The ATIMP is produced at 37° C by “Laboratorio Verri” and it will be injected into patient's CSF at physiological body temperature. The DP will be shipped from “Laboratorio Verri” to OSR with a dedicated courier at controlled temperature (25°C ± 5°C) monitored with a data lo g- ger. The ATIMP will be released to an Investigator or another member of the investigating team designated by Sponsor or Principal Investigator. The person receiving the DP should control the data logger to check the temperature and report any non-compliance. Then the ATIMP will be transferred in a biohazard container at room temperature to the clinical ward for injection, a c- cording to OSR internal operating procedures. Any non-compliance related to the delivery and / or transport of the drug will be managed a c- cording to OSR internal operating procedures. The ATIMP will kept at ambient or room-air temperatures (max 37°C) while waiting for p a- ti ent’s preparation for intrathecally injection. The accounting of the ATIMP will be recorded in the ATIMP log in the Trial Master File (TMF). After injection the CRN will send to the OSR Pharmacy by fax the documentation certifying the receipt of the ATIMP, injection of ATIMP and waste disposal. The PI is responsible for the accountability and traceability of the product. 7.7 NIMPs packaging and labelling NIMPs will be provided by the local pharmacy, according to institutional guidelines. 7.8 NIMPs supply, storage and accountability NIMPs will be delivered by courier to the responsible of pharmacy. The drugs has to be stored following the drug -specific SPC with access only to authorised personnel. The absolute amounts of drug administered per day and per patient have to be documented a ccording to institutional guidelines. The PI is responsible for supply, storage and accountability of the products. 7.9 Further information, emergency procedures No other special information is necessary. 7.10 Methods of assigning patients to treatment groups The protocol will consist of a total of four TC (from A to D), each of which receiving a single escalating dose of hNPCs injected intrathecally as it follows:"
35,page_35,"Clinical Trial Protocol STEMS Rev. n° 1. 2 Page 36 of 54 Rev. date 10 March 2017 - TC-A: 0.7x106 ± 10% cells/kg of body weight; - TC-B: 1.4x106 ± 10% cells/kg of body weight; - TC-C: 2.8x106 ± 10% cells/kg of body weight; - TC-D: 5.7x106 ± 10% cells/kg of body weight. The trial will start with TC-A and will go through the subsequent enrolment of patients to be in- cluded in TCs from B to D. Each cohort will consist of three patients at minimum. However in case of safety issue the nu- merosity of each TC will be increased to six patients, as explained below. We define a DLT any adverse event of grade 3 possibly related to hNPCs or to the procedure. However we will not consider a DLT a prolonged hospitalization due to post lumbar puncture headache if not associated to any meningeal sign. We will not considered DLT adverse events related to concomitant treatments (tacrolimus and steroids) After the inclusion of the first patient of the TC we will wait at least 14 days to treat the second patient. The same interval time will be used for all the further patients within the same TC. After the inclusion of all the planned patients within a TC, we will wait at least 3 months after the in- clusion of the last patient before switching to the higher TC. In case of none DLT within the TC, we will wait at least 3 months after the inclusion of the last patient and then we will move to the higher TC. In case of 1 DLT within the TC, the cohort will be extended to 6 patients. If another DLT will be observed, the current dosage will be considered excessive ad the immediate lower dosage will be considered MTD. The safety monitoring board will review all safety date in the case of an AE ≥ 3 evaluated “po s- sibly related to hNPC” by investigators and in any case before the shifts between TCs. This will be repeated for every TC up to the end of the study. 7.11 Concomitant medication accepted A concomitant therapy is any drug or substance administered from the time of the subject’s wri t- ten consent until the subject’s End of Study Visit. Concomitant treatment with any of the following is allowed: - Medications necessary for the treatment of AEs - Any medications used to treat MS symptoms such as spasticity, bladder impairment, pain, or depression - Short courses of iv high-dose corticosteroids as a rescue medication for exacerbations of MS - Corticosteroids that are administered by non-systemic routes (e.g., topical, inhaled) Any treatment which are continued during the study and/or initiated or changed during the study must be recorded in source data and in the CRF. 7.12 Prohibited Concomitant Therapy Concomitant treatment with any of the following is not allowed while receiving study treatment, unless as otherwise described in this protocol: - Any non-study drug treatments directed toward the treatment of MS such as immunomodu- latory treatments or chronic immunosuppressant therapy except tacrolimus - Any investigational product, including investigational symptomatic therapies for MS and investigational therapies for non-MS indications"

Starting from the signature of the informed consent by the patient or patients’ legal tutors, the subjects will be enrolled in the clinical trial. When the enrolment is confirmed the patient scree n- ing number will be assigned consecutively in increasing order starting with ‘001’. The list will be fi led with the investigator’s file. After the enrolment of a patient in the study, the investigator sends the enrolment module to the principle investigator by fax or email to clinical research monitor. Those protocol phases are foreseen after signature of the informed consent:  Screening/baseline phase , during which the conditions required by the clinical protocol for patients’ inclusion/exclusion will be assessed (screened subject). The duration will be of three weeks (+/- 3 working days). At the end of the screening phase, the inclusion/exclusion crite ria of the study will be evaluated (enclosed subject).  Pre-treatment phase: carried from the end of the screening phase to the day before the start of treatment.  Treatment phase : The intrathecally administration of hNPCs will be performed on day 0. Pro- filactical treatment with Tacrolimus will be performed for 96 weeks starting from day - 7 whereas oral corticosteroids will be administered for the first 4 weeks.  Follow-up phase : 96 weeks after the experimental drug administration day 0. At the end specify if the end of total follow-up or single patient follow-up. At the end of the total follow-up, for all patients enrolled and treated in the study is planned a long term follow up, in accordance with the national applicable laws and the international guid e- lines."

MS relapse definition: appearance of a new neurological abnormality or worsening of previously stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical demyelinating event (McDonald et al. 2001). The abnormality must have been present for at least 24 hours and occurred in the absence of fever (< 37.5°C) or known infection. MS relapse is defined as: any perceived change in symptoms or signs that persist for  48 hours i n the absence of flu or fever and that is accompanied by obje ctive changes on EDSS functional subscores (FSS) that leads to either a 1.0 point change in EDSS (for baseline EDSS 3 - 5.0) or a 0.5 change (for baseline EDSS  5.5) together with FSS changes of 2 points in any one FSS or 1 point in any 2 FS. Only relapses meeting the protocol definition will be considered as measure of efficacy . Diagnosing MS relapses during the study: Patients will be instructed to immediately contact the Primary Treating Physician if he/she develops new or re-occurring or worsening neurological symptoms. If a patient reports new neurological symptoms or worsening of previous symptoms, an unscheduled visit is to be planned as soon as possible, ideally within 7 days. During this visit, the treating physician will first assess whether the new/worsening neurological abnormality is consistent with the definition of MS relapse above. If so, the standard neurological examination (for the EDSS score) should be performed by the Independent EDSS Rater. If there is any doubt in the opinion of the treating physician, the d e- fault must always be to refer the case to the Independent EDSS Rater to perform an EDSS rating."
42,page_42,"Clinical Trial Protocol STEMS Rev. n° 1. 2 Page 43 of 54 Rev. date 10 March 2017 Confirmation of MS relapse: the definition of a confirmed MS relapse is one accompanied by a clinically relevant change in the EDSS performed by the Independent EDSS Rater, i.e. an in- crease of at least 0.5 points on the EDSS score, or an increase of 1 point on two FSs or 2 points on one FS, excluding changes involving bowel/bladder or cerebral FS compared to the previous available rating (the last EDSS rating that did not occur during a relapse)."

44,page_44,"Clinical Trial Protocol STEMS Rev. n° 1. 2 Page 45 of 54 Rev. date 10 March 2017 9.5 Patient information and informed consent All patients should be informed to the fullest extent possible about the study, in language and terms they are able to understand. The investigator (according to applicable regulatory requir e- ments), or a person designated by the investigator, and under the investigator's responsibility, should fully inform the p atient of all pertinent aspects of the clinical trial. The patient must be given ample opportunity to decide whether or not to participate in this study and to ask questions concerning this. It must also be made clear to the patient that he/she can withdraw from the stu- dy at any time without giving reasons and that he/she will not be in any way disadvantaged by this. Prior to a patient’s participation in the clinical trial, he/she MUST give consent freely and con- sciously. Eligible patients may only be included in the study after providing written (witnessed, where required by law or regulation), IRB/IEC/REB-approved informed consent or, if incapable of do- ing so, after such consent has been provided by a legally acceptable representative of the patient. In cases where the patient’s representative gives consent, the patient should be informed about the study to the extent possible given his/her understanding. If the patient is capable of doing so, he/she should indicate assent by personally signing and dating the written informed consent document or a separate assent form. Informed consent/assent must be obtained before conducting any study-specific procedures (i.e. all of the procedures described in the protocol). The process of obtaining informed con- sent/assent should be documented in the patient source documents. The date when a patient’s informed consent/assent was actually obtained will be captured in their CRFs. Any Informed Conse nt will be part of Investigator’s file and retained with it. A copy of the signed and dated written Informed Consent Form must be provided to the patient. 9.6 Minimizing distress Repeated invasive procedures may be painful or frightening. This trial is designed for minimized the discomfort, the studies are designed and conducted by investigators experienced in the treatment of patients. The protocols and investigations was been designed specifically for the MS population (not simply re-worked from adult protocols) and approved by an IEC expert in patients. Practical considerations to ensure that participants’ experiences in clinical studies are positive and to minimize discomfort and distress include the following: ﻅ Personnel knowledgeable and skilled in dealing with the MS population and its needs, including skill in performing MS procedures ﻅ A physical setting with furnitur e, play equipment, activities, and food appropriate for MS ﻅ The conduct of studies in a familiar environment such as the hospital or clinic where participants normally receive their care ﻅ Approaches to minimize discomfort of procedures, such as: ﻅ Topical anes thesia to place IV catheters ﻅ Indwelling catheters rather than repeated venipunctures for blood s ampling ﻅ Collection of some protocol -specified blood samples when routine clinical samples are obtained"

Every effort are made to anticipate and reduce known hazards. Investigators should be fully aware before the start of a clinical study of all relevant preclinical and clinical toxicity of the medicinal product. To minimize risk in clinical studies, those conducting the study should be properly trained and experienced in studying the, including the evaluation and management of potential adverse events. In designing studies, every attempt are made to minimize the number of participants and of pro- cedures, consistent with good study design. Mechanisms should be in place to ensure that a study can be rapidly terminated should an unexpected hazard be noted."
