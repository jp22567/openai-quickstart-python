11,page_11,"Page 12 of 59 Protocol No: MHICC -2018 -001 Version: FINAL 10 Protocol Version: June 1ST, 2020 1.0 RATIONALE 1.1 Background Heart failure (HF) represents a major public health concern and i ts incidence will continue to rise as the population ages. The growing burden of HF on healthcare cost s is well documented.1 Despite major advances in diagnosis and treatment, HF is asso ciated with high rate s of decompensation, hospitalization and mortality. Developing n ew approaches for patients with HF are essential. In the past, major efforts have been directed toward reducing length of stay by the development of performance measures, with the intent to improve post -discharge outcomes.2,3 Recently, however, the focus has shifted toward s 30-day post -discharge readmission rates as a measure of quality of care due to important changes in reimbursem ent patterns in the U S. Congestion is one of the hallmark s of HF hospitalization s and an increase in body weight seem s to be associated with HF -related hospitalization s, usually begin ning at least one week before admission for acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF) .4 Consequently, increased daily weight may identify a high risk period during which one can intervene to avert ADHF requiring hosp italization .5 In addition to congestion, the prese nce of pulmonary hypertension (PH) secondary to heart failure, classifi ed as World H ealth Organization (WHO) Group 2 PH6 is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.7 Therefore, in theory, an elevated pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP) and increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) should represent meaningful trigger s for therapeutic intervention s, and the reduction of decompensated HF an attractive therapeutic target . HF management programs which rely on patients’ empowerment through education and careful follow -up, as well as pharmacological and device -optimization have been shown to decrease hospital admissions, emergency consultations, improve quality of life and probably survival.8 Unfortunately, due to resource limitations and t he increasing number of patients with moderate to severe heart failure, the majority of patients that could benefit from follow -up in multidisciplinary heart failure clinics (HFC) do not readily have access to them in a timely manner .9 Innovative approaches might be crucial to changing the emphasis of the HFC and processes. New transitional models for HF care have been de veloped, such as structured telephone care (or telehealth) with"
12,page_12,"Page 13 of 59 Protocol No: MHICC -2018 -001 Version: FINAL 10 Protocol Version: June 1ST, 2020 symptoms and vital signs monitoring , home visits, use of technology and remote monitoring systems to reduce HF -related hospitalizations , but with mixed results .10-12 Recently, the BEAT - HF trial failed to show a benefit for 30 and 180 days readmission or morta lity using a combined approach of health coaching telephone calls and telemonitoring with electronic equipment for daily information (BP, HR, symptoms and weight);13 likewise, the REM -HF14,15 trial using a similar approach was also negative. Weight may not be a specific enough marker o f ADHF, since it may vary for many reasons. It is possible that current markers such as symptoms and weight gain are late and indirect measures of decompensation and that earlier detection of congestion could prompt intervention s and avert the incoming ADHF and hospital admission.15 Monitoring of intrathoracic impedance (Optivol ® CRT -D), with an imbedded feature in some of the implanted devices (pacemaker or defibrillator) show ed promise, but the DOT -HF study using intrathoracic impedance with an audible alert did not improve outcome s and increased HF admission s,16 while t he recent Multisense trial was negative .17 Likewise neutral results were observed in stable pat ients using electronic implanted devices from multiple providers .14 Using more sensitive physiologic markers for the development of acute decompensation , such as increased filling pressure , may be beneficial. A variety of implantable hemodynamic monitors (IHM) have been developed to provide objective and continuous information on hemodynamic status in ambulatory HF patients, which may facilitate the timeliness of interventions and improve outcomes .18 Interesting initial results were obtained for a pacemaker -like device with a RV lead that contains a sensor near its tip to measure right ventric le (RV) pressures (estimated pulmonary artery diastolic (ePAD) ) in 274 patients enrolled in the C OMPASS HF trial (Chronicle Offers Management to Patients with Advanced Signs and Symptoms of HF ).19 Safety (8% complications , mostly lead dislodgements) and primary efficacy (21% decrease d in HF-related events ) endpoints were met. Unfortunately, the REDUCE -HF trial ( REducing Decompensation events Utilizing intraCardiac p rEssures in patients with c HF) was prematurely terminated due to sensor lead failure after 400 patients were enrolled and showed no significant difference in HF events after one year of follow -up.19 Another device, the Heart -POD ( Abbott Laboratories , Illinois, USA ) measures directly the left atrial pressure and has shown promising results in a preliminary observational study of 40 ambulatory HF patients.20 In order to try to further empower the patients in"
13,page_13,"Page 14 of 59 Protocol No: MHICC -2018 -001 Version: FINAL 10 Protocol Version: June 1ST, 2020 HOMEOSTASIS , they followed a physician -directed therapeutic strategy guided by left atrial pressure ( LAP ), which led to a drop in mean daily LAP, decreased the HF hospitalization rate, and resulted in improvements in New York Heart Asso ciation ( NYHA ) class, left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) and pharmacological profiles.20,21 A larger unbli nded study , the LAPTOP -HF trial,22,23 was recently stopped early due to excess of procedure related complications after enrolment of 486 of the 730 planned patients ; the annualized HF hospitalization rates for implanted patients was 0.40 versus 0.68 in Control patients, RRR 41%, p=0.005, offering insights into the benefits of hemodynamic monitoring and the use of physician directed, patient self - management .22,23 The patient self -management features have been embedded in a smart phone application that will be available commercially before the end of 2019 and that we propose to use for this protocol . Recently the FDA and Health Canada approv ed a novel implantable sensor inserted into the right pulmonary artery that measures pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) in patients with HF, the CardioMEMS ™ HF System (Abbott Laboratories , Illinois, USA ). The coil and capacitor are housed within the sensor to form a miniature electrical circuit that resonates at a specific frequency ; variation in PAP will alter the baseline resonant frequency emitted by the senso r, which is electromagnetically coupled to an external antenna for data transmission . Frequency shif ts are displayed as pressure waveform s. The data can then be transmitted to the web -based platform for clinical analysis .24 The CHAMPION trial evaluated the effect of PAP-guided therapy on HF - related hospitalization s compared to standard of care in 550 patients with NYHA functional class III or IV symptoms . A 28% reduction in HF -related hospitalization s was observed after 6 -months of follow -up.25 As expected , the presence of PH identifie d HF patients at risk for adverse outcomes, but knowledge of hemodynamic variables allowed for more effective treatment strategies to reduce hospitalization s, albeit with no impact on mortality.26 Interestingly, both patients with HF with preserved e jection f raction (HFpEF ) (using a definition of LVEF≥40%) and HF with reduced ejection fraction ( HFrEF) derived benefit ,27 making the CardioMEMS ™ HF System the first treatment option to show promise for patients with HFpEF , an increasingly recognized cause of group 2 PH .28 Moreover, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) concomitant with HF also derived benefit from hemodynamic monitoring in CHAMPION.29 An example of the proposed treatment algorithm is available at the"
14,page_14,"Page 15 of 59 Protocol No: MHICC -2018 -001 Version: FINAL 10 Protocol Version: June 1ST, 2020 Annex 1. Further, data from CHAMPION have shown that PH is underestimated by right heart catheterization (RHC) in nearly 50% of patients with HF .30 RHC provide s a “snapshot” of a patient’s hemodynamic profile at a single time point, in a hospital -based setting , which may not reflect real life hemodynamic s in other settings . These results are consistent with the ESCAPE trial in ADHF patients, which found that pulmonary artery (PA) catheter –guided care was not superior to traditional clinical assessment of volume in preventing subsequent decompensation.31 However, levels of certain hemodynamic parameters such as pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and mean PA pressure were predictors of later risk for hospitalization. Full characterization of PH status and guidance for medical management may be best a ccomplished with recurrent assessment of pressures provided by an implanted hemodynamic monitor ( IHM ). In CHAMPION , patients with no PH on RHC but PH revealed by the IHM had significantly higher HF hospitalization rates than those without this “occult” PH,30 suggesting that IHM can provide additional information on the patient’s overall risk of HF hospitalization. Further, t he use of an IHM such as the CardioMEMS ™ HF System provides an unique opportunity to fine -tune patient management with its dual capacity of provid ing daily information on congestion (diastolic PAP) and the severity of PH (systolic and mean PAP). Lastly , there is increasing evidence that filling pressures may influence the arrhythmia burden ; a positive relationship has been demonstrated between changes in intra-cardiac pressures and risk for ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF ).32 There are several potential mechanisms by which an elevated ventricular pressure could influence the development of arrhythmias : stimulat ion of neurohormonal activat ion,33 increase in sympathetic tone,34 and aberrant intracellular calcium cycling. In addition, a cute diastolic stretch shortens action potential duration an d refractoriness , whereas chronic dilatation does not ,35 presumably because of activation of stretch -activated channels.36 There is an opportunity to evaluate the arrhythmia burden in patients with IHM , including atrial fibrillation (AF) , VT/VF and implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD) events . The possibility of remote HF monitoring with the C ardio MEMS ™ HF System opens a new avenue for patients with HF, especially the elderly or those living far away from HF clinics . The use of such high -intensity remote monitoring carries the potential for successful detection of parameter"
15,page_15,"Page 16 of 59 Protocol No: MHICC -2018 -001 Version: FINAL 10 Protocol Version: June 1ST, 2020 deviations , tailored therapy, more rigorous follow -up and improved outcome s. Moreover, it has been shown to be cost -effective not only in CHAMPION36 but also in a real life setting,4 mostly because of reduction in hospital readmission s.37 At the Montreal Heart Institute (MHI) , during the financial year 2 018-19 there were 900 hospital admissions with a primary diagnosis of heart failure in 716 patients. Of those, 34% were readmitted within the same financial year and 241 patients had ≥1 readmission (range: 1 -9) (see appendix 2). Targeting these high-risk patients with technology using pulmonary artery pressure monitoring could possibly expand our ability at the HFC to treat a large r number of patients remotely , decrease costly hospital readmission s and hence creat e a virtual heart failure disease management program (HFDMP ). Accordingly, we propose a paradigm shift towards disease co -management , using patient remote hemodynamic data, accessed through a smart phone app, and a virtual HF clinic run by a nurse clinician specialized in HF with the backup of a HF cardiologist . 2. HYPOTHESIS : 2.1 Primary Hypothesis Due to the dynamic nature of HF and knowledge that filling pressures can rise rapidly over hours to days,20 the capacity of patients to get precise PAP measure ments as needed will provide critical information in a timely manner. Using a personalized strategy will allow for appropriate adjustments of medications based on current PAP values categorized and accessed via a smartphone app , which will help curtail increase s in left -sided filling pressures and thereby avert hospitalizations for ADHF. Also providing the patient and nurse clinician access to the patients’ hemodynamic data on a continuous basis could empower patients to take more responsibility in the management of their disease through engagement and self -learning concerning dietary indiscretion, fluid and salt restriction that may impact PAP measures. Finally, knowledge of their PAP may provide reassur ance in the event of vague symptoms not directly attributable to HF and decrease the number of emergency department visits . It may also help in making non -HF diagnoses by eliminating HF as a caus e of dyspnea (i.e bronchitis) ."

An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) will be calculated by comparison of ca lculated costs and quality -adjusted life years in both study groups. This data will then be used to construct an economic model to evaluate the cost -effectiveness in a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 patients. This data will be used to calculate the incremental cost per Quality -Adjusted Life Year ( QALY ) gained and per life -year gained. We will perform deterministic sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of uncertainty in key parameters on the analysis results and a probabil istic sensitivity analysis to further characterize uncertainty in model parameters. Detailed resource utilization and costs will be collected prospectively for randomized patients, including diagnostic evaluation costs directly incurred as a result of the CardioMEMS ™ HF System procedure, procedural costs, and inpatient treatment costs at a large tertiary care hospital in Montreal ( MHI) . Individual patient -level costs of heart failure hospitalizations, emergency room (ER) visits, and short stay costs for int ravenous diuretics will be obtained from the Montreal Heart Institute. Follow -up costs will include protocol driven visits and tests, and additional unscheduled outpatient treatment visits for heart failure or visits to the HFC . Evaluation of quality of l ife will be performed using the KCCQ questionnaire and quality adjusted life years (life expectancy adjusted for quality of life of the health state experienced) will be calculated for each patient in the alive state using published health utilities, which measure quality of life from a 0 (dead) to 1 (perfect health) scale, for heart failure according to NYHA Class and results of the KCCQ questionnaire. In the absence of questionnaire data for hospitalized patients, utility decrements will be applied for heart failure hospitalizations and emergency room visits as per the published literature. A short -term utility decrements (i.e. disutility) for the CardioMEM S™ procedure will be approximated using published decrements for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) ."

STUDY PROTOCOL 5.1 Study design Type of study : A single center prospective randomized open -label blinded -endpoint (PROBE) trial is proposed comparing two strategies for patients with HF who had at least one admission for a primary diagnosis of HF regardless of LVEF in the previous year i.e., usual care by a specializ ed multidisciplinary HF clinic team versus hemodynamic monitoring and self-empowered remote follow -up using the newly developed smart -phone/iPad application , with the back -up of a nurse clinician and a HF cardiologist and limited HF clinic visits . 150 e ligible patients who consent to participate will be randomized to the control group or intervention group in a 1:1 ratio. Patients randomized to hemodynamic monitoring (CardioMEMS group) will have the CardioMEMS ™ HF System implanted as an outpatient procedure withi n a week of random assignment . Before randomization, patients will need to be stable as judged by the treating HF clinic cardiologist . After randomization, all subjects will receive education on HF as per local pr actice as well as recommendations regarding nutrition and exercise , for daily weights, medication record, clinical notes and appointments . Patients in the control group will be followed as per usual practice by the MHI multidisciplinary HF clinic. Patients in the CardioMEMS group will be seen at baseline , week 1 and week 2 after implantation , two months and twelve months after randomization and will be in regular contact with the lead research nurse with virtual follow -ups at weeks 3, 4, 6, 12, 16 , 20, 24, 28 , 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48. The specialized HF clinician nurse and cardiologist will design an individualized pre - specified therapeutic plan according to CHF guidelines and clinical experience with that individual patient (Appendix 3 ). For HFrEF, GDMT will be implemented in both groups, including ICD and CRT referral when indicated . For patients in the CardioMEMS group, a blood pressure cuff will be provided and hemodynamic data will be taken twice daily by the patient from the moment of randomizat ion in the trial. i-Pad® internet communication using Skype /Facetime or telephone calls will be done twice in the first month, once in the second month and monthly thereafter, unless a medical problem occurs that"

The patient will implement the individualized therapeutic plan designed by the HF clinician nurse and cardiologist, following a pre -specified algorithm (Appendix 1), which includes titration of angiotensin - converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) , angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI), hydralazine, nitrates, beta -blockers and mineralocorticoid antagonists as needed. Initiation of some of these medications may require a visit to the research clinic, if judged necessary and will be counted as unscheduled visit . Diuretics and potassium supplementation will be adjusted according to indi vidualized target PAP pressures, electrolytes and renal function . Blood samples for electrolytes and re nal function : sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate will be drawn one week after any changes of medications, or as deemed clinic ally indicated by the treating team. The research team will follow the laboratory results and intervene as needed. Objectives for PAP pressures will be similar to the CHAMPION trial, i.e., PAP systolic (15–35 mmHg), PAP diastolic (8 –20 mmHg), and PAP mean (10–25 mmHg) . PA measurements will be transmitted daily for the first two weeks, three times a week thereafter, and more frequently as needed. Also, patients will have access to the research nurse coordinator for advices or to signal changes in their stat e (for example a bronchial infection, diarrhea etc.). Further, patients in the CardioMEMS ™ group will have access to categorized data (very low, low, in range, high or very high pressures) using the app and be able to adjust their medication (mostly diuretics) according to an individualized algorithm. Furthermore, d ata reaching thresholds will be reviewed daily during working days and patients will be contacted in the event of clinically significant changes, as individually defined at the outset. The general aim is to introduce and rapidly up -titrate GDMT for patients with HFrEF (ACEi , ARB or AR NI), beta -blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists ( MRA), to reduce or eliminate diuretic doses for patients with low or very low PAP, and to increase diuretic or vasodilator doses for high or very high PAP.

SPECIFIC ASSESSMENTS 7.1 End point variables Blood pressure measurement, biochemistry monitoring and renal function Blood pressure will be measured and recorded at each visits according to the recommendations of the Canadian Hypertension Education Program.38 Electrolytes, serum creatinine and vital signs will be assessed as described in the Study flow chart. In the assessment renal function, eGFR will be calculated as previously described using the MDRD equation .39 Cystatin C Moreover, in order to better characterize changes in renal function during the study, cystatin C will be measured at baseline and at the end of the study. Cystatin C is a novel biomarker of renal function which appears to be more sensitive than serum creatinine to detect modest changes in renal function.40Moreover, in HF, it has been shown to be a powerful prognostic marker.40 N-terminal proB -type natriuretic peptide (NT -proBNP). BNP is secreted primarily from the ventricles in both healthy individuals and patients with CHF.41 The production of BNP in the ventricle increases proportionally with increases in both ventricular wall tension and stretch. Both BNP and NT pro -BNP, the inactive portion of pro -BNP, have been shown to correlate with LVEF, left ventricular volumes an d pressures. While neurohumoral blockade decrease the NT -proBNP levels and prognosis, to our knowledge, there has been no study showing that effective pressure management significantly reduce concentrations of BNP and NT - proBNP. NT -proBNP will be measured by Dr. Joel Lavoie using the « Roche proBNP assay » (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), on the Elecsys 2010 analyzer (Roche diagnostics). Our group has had exten sive experience in measuring NT -proBNP in previous studies .42-45 PIIINP It is now widely accepted that aldosterone induces deleterious effects on extracellular matrix balance, for which type I and III collagen constitute the majority of the collagen.46-48 These alterations in collagens type I and III have been proposed to play a key role in myocardial stiffness.48 Previous work has demonstrated that PIIINP serum levels were associated with poor outcomes in patients with HF.49,50 Because it is expected that p ressure management will reduce"

PIIINP will be measured in the laboratory at the Montreal Heart Institute directed by Dr Martin G. Sirois using the Orion Diagnostica’s UniQ PIIINP a ssay. The use of this assay has been validated in numerous studies in humans. Dr Sirois’s laboratory has measured PIIINP in a study comparing circulating levels of various biomarkers between patien ts with systolic HF and HF -PEF, as well as in a study comparing concentrations of biomarkers between patients with HF and anemia and HF patients without anemia.53 Together with NT -proBNP, this biomarker will be very important in demonstrating that the beneficial effects of pressure management on cardiac remodeling . Osteopontin (OPN) An additional marker of remodeling, osteopontin [OPN]) is a glycoprotein that can be detected in plasma and was found to be upregulated in several animal models of cardiac failure54 and may thus represent a new biomarker that facilitates risk stratification in patients with heart failure;48 it has been shown to cor relate with disease severity and poor prognosis.55,56 OPN seems to have a piv otal role in the development of Angiotensin II -induced cardiac fibrosis and remodeling. Moreover, the effect of Eplerenone on the prevention of cardiac fibrosis, but not cardiac hypertrophy, might be partially mediated through the inhibition of OPN express ion.57 Thus, we will also measure angiotensin -II and aldosterone, two important step s in the remodeling and fibrosis pathways. High sensitivity C -Reactive protein (HS -CRP) While h eart failure has been shown to be an inflammatory condition,58,59 the impact of pressure management on HS -CRP has not been well characterized. We herein propose to measure HS -CRP in our patients undergoing hemodynamic monitoring. Cardiac Troponin T (cTnT) In heart failure, the level of troponin correlates with prognostic independently of the presence of ischemic etiology or myocardial stretch assessed by NT -proBNP. This troponin leak varies with time and has been shown to be associated with decreased survival. We herein propose to measure cTnT in our patients undergoing hemodynamic monitoring."
30,page_30,"Page 31 of 59 Protocol No: MHICC -2018 -001 Version: FINAL 10 Protocol Version: June 1ST, 2020 Emerging markers Galectin -3 serves important functions in numerous biological activities including cell growth, apoptosis, pre -mRNA splicing, differentiation, transformation, angiogenesis, inflammation, fibrosis and host defense.60-63 Numerous previous studies have indicated that galectin -3 may be used as a diagnostic or prognostic biomarker for certain types of heart disease, kidney disease and cancer.64 Galectin -3 levels are correlated with elevated risk for new HF in healthy people and acute myocardial infarction with reduced ejection fraction patients .65 Thus, it is probable that galectin - 3 has a more important role in the beginning stage of HF including early fibrosis and ventricular.66 Whether hemodynamic management leads to improved levels of the biomarker is unknown at the present time. ST2 cardiac biomarker is a protein biomarker of cardiac stress encoded by the IL1RL1 gene. ST2 signals the presence and severity of adverse cardiac remodeling and tis sue fibrosis , which occurs in response to myocardial infarction , acute coronary syndrome , or worsening heart failure .62,67,68 ,59 ST2 provides prognostic information that is independent of other cardiac biomarkers such as BNP , NT-proBNP , highly sensitive troponin , GDF -15, and galectin -3.[3] One study indicated that discrimination is independent of age, body mass index , history of heart failure, anemia and impaired renal failure or sex. Vasopressin (arginine vasopressi n, AVP; antidiuretic hormone, ADH) is a peptide hormone formed in the hypothalamus , then transported via axons to the posterior pituitary, which releases it into the blood. AVP has two pri nciple sites of action: the kidney and blood vessels.69 The primary function of AVP in the body is to regulate extracellular fluid volume by regulating renal handling of water, although it is also a vasoconstrictor. AVP acts on renal collecting ducts via V 2 receptors to increase water permeability (cAMP -dependent mechanism), which leads to decreased urine formation (hence, the antidiuretic action of ""antidiuretic hormone""). This increases blood volume, cardiac output and arterial pressure. Heart failure is associated with what might be viewed as a paradoxical increase in AVP. Increased blood volume and atrial pressure associated with heart failure should decrease AVP secretion, but it does not. It may be that sympathetic and renin - angiotensin system activation in heart failure override the volume and low pressure cardiovascular"

Whether hemodynamic monitoring leads to a decrease in AVP is unknown . Drug concentrations Concentrations of commonly used drugs in patients with HF will be measured at the baseline visit, as well as at visits at week 2, month 2, month 12 and at unscheduled visits. At each of these visits, the dose, the time of administration of the last dose of the cardiovascular medications and the time of the blood draw will be recorded. Currently, very little information is available regarding the pharmacokinetic (PK) or concentrations of drugs in HF patients.71 Data from our group and others have suggested marke d differences in the concentrations or PK of commonly used drugs in HF patients compared to healthy individuals such as spironolactone and candesartan (manuscripts submitted). This could be attributable to several factors such as decreased renal function.71 More over, only very limited data are available on the factors influencing the PK of drugs in patients with HF.71 In addition, little information is available on the magnitude of the effects of common dosing adjustments of HF drugs in “real -life” HF patients on drug concentrations, or whether patients who cannot reach target doses of HF medication actually have lower drug concentrations than those who do. Indeed, some patients who do not reach target doses could present comparable drug concentrations as patients reac hing target doses, if they present clinical factors that predispose to increased concentrations, such as renal dysfunction.71 The screening and quantification of drugs or their active metabolites will be performed in plasma at the Platform of Biopharmacy of the Faculty of Pharmacy at Université de Montréal using Liquid Chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (LC -MS/MS) in the selective MRM mode72-76 and Liquid Chromatography High -Resolution Mass Spectrometer (LC -HRMS) of the type quadrupole time -of-flight (QTof) in the full scan mode.77-82 This group has an extensive experience for developing and optimising the bioanalytical techniques needed to measure"

All SAEs will be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) as adverse events up to 14 days after final visit. The investigator is responsible for informing the Ethics Committee of the SAE as per local requirements. 9. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Descriptive statistics of all study endpoint s will be presented overall and broken down by group. Number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum will be presented for continuous variables. Count and proportion will be displayed for categorical variables . For the primary endpoint , the analysis will consist of an unadjusted comparison of time to first event. Event -rate curves will be estimated by the Kaplan -Meier product -limit method and the difference between groups will be assessed using the log -rank test. Components of the primary endpoint will be analyzed similarly. ANCOVA models will be used to compare continuous endpoint s expressed as change from baseline to 12 months between the standard group and the virtual group. The main model will include fixed effects for group with the baseline value as a covariate. Difference between groups in other continuous endpoint s will be tested by either two -sample t -tests or Wilcoxon rank -sum tests depending on the normality of the data. Difference between groups in categorical endpoint s will be tested using Chi -square tests. Basic assumptions of the proposed analyses will be checked and data transformation or other analyses could be done if appropriate. For example, as some endpoints are likely to be skewed (ex. hs-CRP), log -transformation might be used, in which case descript ive statistics would also include geometric means. Missing values will not be imputed. All statistical tests will be two -sided and conducted at the 0.05 significance level. Statistical analyses will be done using SAS version 9.4 or higher."
35,page_35,"Page 36 of 59 Protocol No: MHICC -2018 -001 Version: FINAL 10 Protocol Version: June 1ST, 2020 A statistical an alysis plan (SAP) will be written to fully describe the statistical analyses that will be done. The SAP will be finalized prior to database lock . 9.1. Sample size It is hypothesized that virtual monitoring will be superior to standard care in reducing the risk of the composite primary endpoint of acute decompensated heart failure that requires emergency department consultation and/or unplanned intravenous heart failure therapy in an outpatient clinic , hospital admission for heart failure , or CV death during 12 months of follow -up. The sample size rationale and assumptions are based on the following: From the CHAMPION trial, the rate of HF hospitalization at 12 months was 0.52 and 0.75 in the treatment and control groups respectively ( Phil Adamson personal communication, unpublished data) , leading to a hazard ratio of 0.53 . Similar event rates are expected for the primary endpoint in this trial. The mortality rate is expected to be similar between the two groups as in CHAM PION. Using a log -rank test, a total of 136 subjects ( 68 in each group) would provide 80% power with a two-sided significance level of α=0.05. Factoring in a dr op-out rate of approximately 10%, a total of 15 0 patients are required. 10. INVESTIGATOR’S REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS 10.1.
