Benefit Assessment Participant s may experience clinically meaningful improvements in their HS les ions during the study and may additionally benefit from the comprehensive safety assessments conducted as part of the study (eg, clinical laboratory tests, physical examination s, ECG s). They will also contribute to the process of developing a novel anti- inflammatory agent for HS , a disease with high unmet need that is s everely debilitating to participants ' well -being and daily functioning. 2.3.4. Benefit -Risk Conclusion Taking into account the safety measures taken to minimize risk to participant s in this study, the potential risks identified in association with INCB054707 are justifiable and appropriately balanced by the anticipated efficacy benefits expected to be afforded to this specific group of participant s and, more broadly, to the general population of patients with HS.

Preparation , Handling , and Accountability The investigator (or designee) is responsible for study treatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). Inventory and accountability records must be maintained and readily available for inspection by the study monitor and are open to inspection at any time by any applicable regulatory authorities. The investigator or designee must maintain records that document: • Delivery of study drug to the study site . • Inventory of study drug at the site. • Participant use of the study drug including tablet counts from each supply dispensed. • Return of study drug to the investigator or designee by participant s. The investigational product must be used only in accordance with the Protocol. The investigator will also maintain records adequately documenting that participants were provided the specified study drug. These records should include dates, quantities, and any available batch or serial numbers or unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product and participant s. Completed accountability records will be archived by the site . The investigator or designee will be expected to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially used containers of study drug until verified by the study monitor (unless otherwise agreed to by the sponsor). At the conclusion of the study, the investigator or designee will oversee shipment of any remaining study drug back to the sponsor or its designee for destruction according to institutional SOPs . If local procedures mandate on -site destruction of investigation al supply, the site should (where local procedures allow) maintain the investigational supply until the study monitor inspects the accountability records in order to evaluate compliance and accuracy of accountability by the investigative site . At sites where the study drug is destroyed before monitor inspection, the monitors rely on documentation of destruction per the site SOP . Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study treatments are provided in the Study Reference Manual. 6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding Not applicable. This is an open- label study. 6.4. Study Treatment Compliance Compliance with all study -related treatments should be emphasized to the participant by the site personnel, and appropriate steps should be taken to optimize compliance during the study. Compliance with INCB054707 will be calculated by the sponsor based o n the drug accountability documented by site personnel and monitored by the sponsor/designee using tablet counts. Participant s will be instructed to bring all study drug with them to the study visits in order for site personnel to conduct tablet counts to assess study drug accountability . The drug accountability documentation will be used by the sponsor to calculate treatment compliance. CONFIDENTIAL"

Note: Topical agents with limited systemic availability are permitted. • Concomitant uses of P-gp inhibitors and inducers (s ee Appendix C ) need to be consulted with the medical monitor. • Live vaccines (during the study and within 6 weeks afte r EOT ). 6.6.4. Rescue Lesional Treatments Rescue lesional treatments are described in Section 8.2.4, as the need for rescue lesional treatment is considere d an efficacy assessment. 7. DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY TREATMENT AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL 7.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment 7.1.1. Reasons for Discontinuation Participants must be withdrawn from study treatment for the following reasons: • Consent is withdrawn . Note: Consent withdrawn means that the participant can no longer be followed. Participants who choose to discontinue study treatment will be encouraged to remain in the study for safety monitoring. • Further participation would be injurious to the participant 's health or well-being, in the investigator 's medical judgment. • The study is terminated by the sponsor. • The study is terminated by the local health authority , IRB , or IEC. A participant may be dis continued from study treatment as follows: • If, during the study, a participant is found not to have met eligibility criteria, the medical monitor, in collaboration with the investigator, will determine whether the participant should be discontinued from the study treatment. • If a participant is noncompliant with study procedures or study drug administration in the investigator 's opinion, the sponsor should be consulted for discussion regarding the participant 's continued participation. 7.1.2. Discontinuatio n Procedures In the event that the decision is made to permanently discontinue the study treatment, the EOT visit should be conducted. Reasonable efforts should be made to have the participant return for a follow-up visit. These visits are described in Table 3 and Section 8.7. The last date of the last dose of study drug and the reason for discontinuation of study treatment will be recorded in the eCRF. CONFIDENTIAL"
31,page_31,"Incyte Corporation Page 32 of 78 Protocol INCB 54707- 202 Am 1 Version 1 19 JUL 2018 If a participant is discontinued from study treatment: • The study monitor or sponsor must be notified. • The reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented in the participant' s medical record and the primary reason for withdrawal must be included in the eCRF. • The EOT visit should be performed. • The date of the EOT visit should be recorded in the eCRF . • Participants must be followed for safety until the time of the follow-up visit or until study drug–related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, whichever is longest. If the participant discontinues study treatment and actively withdraws consent for collection of follow-up data (s afety follow -up or disease assessment), then no additional data collection should occur; however, participants will have the option of withdrawing consent for study treatment but continuing in the follow- up period of the study for safety/efficacy assessmen ts. 7.2. Participant Withdrawal From the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any sampl es taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. See Table 3 for data to be collected at the time of study d iscontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 7.3. Lost to Follow -Up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visi t: • The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible. The participant will be counseled regarding the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study. • Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified l etter to the participant 's last known mailing address CONFIDENTIAL"
32,page_32,"Incyte Corporation Page 33 of 78 Protocol INCB 54707- 202 Am 1 Version 1 19 JUL 2018 or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant 's medical record. • Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withd rawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up. 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES 8.1. Administrative and General Procedures 8.1.1. Informed Consent Process • The investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the participa nt or his/her legally authorized representative and answer all questions regarding the study. − Informed consent must be obtained before any study- related procedures are conducted, unless otherwise specified by the Protocol. − Informed consent must be obtained using the IRB/IEC -approved version in a language that is native and understandable to the participant. A template will be provided by the sponsor or its designee. The sponsor or its designee must review and acknowledge the site -specific changes to the I CF template. The ICF must include a statement that the sponsor or its designee and regulatory authorities have direct access to participant records. − The ICF must contain all required elements and describe the nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study in a form understandable to the study participant. • Participants must be informed that their participation is voluntary. Participants or their legally authorized representative will be required to sign a statement of informed consent that meets the applicable requirements and regulations for the country in which the study is being conducted as well as the IRB/IEC or study center. • The participant must be informed that his/her personal study- related data will be used by the sponsor in accordance with local data protection laws. The level of disclosure must also be explained to the participant. • The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by Clinical Quality Assurance auditors or other authorized personnel appointed by the sponsor, by appropriate IRB/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities. • The medical record must include a statement that written informed consent was obtained before the participant was enrolled in the study and the date the written consent was obtained. The authorized person obtaining the informed consent must also sign the ICF. CONFIDENTIAL"
33,page_33,"Incyte Corporation Page 34 of 78 Protocol INCB 54707- 202 Am 1 Version 1 19 JUL 2018 • Participants must provide consent to the most current version of the ICF(s) during their participation in the study. • A copy of the ICF(s) must be provided to t he participant or the participant's legally authorized representative. • Participants who are rescreened are required to sign a new ICF. 8.1.2. Screening Procedures Each participant will be identified in the study by a participant ID number, which is a combination of the site ID and participant number. Screening is the interval between obtaining informed consent and the day of the first administration of study drug (Day 1). Scr eening assessments for determination of eligibility may be performed over a period lasting up to 28 days . Procedures conducted as part of the participant' s routine clinical management (eg, clinical laboratory tests ) and collected before informed consent is obtained may be used for screening or baseline purposes, provided the procedure meets the protocol-defined criteria and has been performed within 28 days before Day 1. All information associated with eligibility requirements , including demography and medical history, must be entered into the appropriate eCRF pages. Results from the screening assessments will be reviewed to confirm eligibility before administration of study drug. Tests results that do not meet eligibility requir ements may be repeated once during screening if the investigator believes there is a reasonable possibility that the participant would be eligible if retested . For screening assessments that are repeated, the most recent available result before administra tion of study drug will be used to determine eligibility . See Section 5.4 regarding screen failures. 8.1.3. Distribution of Reminder Cards and Diaries Participants will be provided with a reminder card at the visits indicated at Table 3. The reminder card will indicate the date/time of the next visit and will also remind the participant that they should not take study drug on Day 1, Week 4, and Week 8 visits, as they will take it after blood draws for safety evaluation have been completed. The reminder cards will have an area on which the date and time of the last dose taken (from the previous evening) for Week 4 and Week 8 visits and the time of their last meal before the visit for Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, and Week 8 will be recorded. Diaries will be provided to participants at the visits indicated at Table 3 to record HS pain NRS (see Section 8.2.5) and analgesic use (see Section 8.2.6). CONFIDENTIAL"
34,page_34,"Incyte Corporation Page 35 of 78 Protocol INCB 54707- 202 Am 1 Version 1 19 JUL 2018 8.1.4. Demography and Medical History 8.1.4.1. Demographics and General Medical History Demographic data and general medical history will be collected at screening by the investigator or qualified designee and will include date of birth, race, ethnicity, medical and surgical history, and current illnesses. Medical history will include relevant medical or surgical treatment within the last year that are considered to be clinically significant by the investigator. 8.1.4.2. Disease Characteristics and Treatment History A disease- targeted medical and treatment history will be collected at screening. A detailed history of prior medications use related to HS in the year before screening will be also be collected, as well as response to each treatment and reason for discontinuation. 8.2. Efficacy Assessments An example of the lesion count worksheet is provided in Appendix D and will be used for assessment of Hurley S tage, HiSCR, modified Sartorius scale, and (see Section 8.5.3). It includes assessment of 12 anatomic regions: left/right axilla, left/righ t sub/ inframammary area, intermammary area, left/right buttock, left/right inguino -crural fold, perianal area, perineal area, and other areas. Additionally, the need for rescue lesional treatment, including number of interventions, will be documented in this worksheet. 8.2.1. Hurley Stages of Hidradenitis Suppurativa Hurley S tages of HS are defined in Table 8. The investigator will determine the Hurley Stage in each affected anatomical region at the designated study visits listed in Table 3. If more than 1 stage is present in a region, the worst stage in each region should be documented. The participant is assigned Hurley Stage corresponding to the Hurley Stage of his or her worst involved anatomic region. Table 8: Hurley Stages of Hidradenitis Suppurativa Stage Description I abscess formation (single or multiple) without sinus tracts and cicatrization II recurrent abscesses with tract formation and cicatrization; single or multiple, widely separated lesions III diffuse or near- diffuse involvement or multiple interconnected tracts and abscesses across the entire area 8.2.2. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response ( Abscess and Inflammatory Nodule Count ) An HiSCR is defined as at least 50% reduction in AN count with no increase in abscess count and no increase in draining fistula (see definition below) count relative to baseline at each visit (see Appendix D ; Kimball et al 2016). CONFIDENTIAL"
35,page_35,"Incyte Corporation Page 36 of 78 Protocol INCB 54707- 202 Am 1 Version 1 19 JUL 2018 A fistula is a pathologic passageway connecting to the skin surface from dermis or subcutaneous tissue. Draining fistulas are fistulas that drain serous or purulent fluid, either spontaneously or by gentle palpation. 8.2.3. Modified Sartorius Scale The modified Sartorius s cale is a measure of the severity of HS (see Appendix D and Appendix E ; Sartorius et al 2003). Points are given as follows for each body area: 2 points for each nodule (both inflammatory and non-inflammatory) ; 4 points for each abscess; 4 points for each fistula (both draining and non-draining) ; 1 point for each scar; 2 to 6 points for the longest distance between 2 lesions or 0 points if no lesions; and 6 points if lesions are not separated by normal skin or 0 points if lesions are separated by normal skin . The ""other area "" only with the highest modified Sartorius scale at baseline will be calculated , and the same area should be evaluated throughout the study. The total modified Sartorius s cale score is the sum of the 12 anatomic region scores. 8.2.4. Need for Rescue Lesional Treatment The need for lesional rescue treatment will be recorded as a measure of efficacy. In the event of an acutely painful lesion that requires immediate intervention, investigators will have the option to perform protocol-allowed interventions. Two types of interventions are permitted: injection with intralesional triamcinolon e acetonide suspension (up to 30 mg in total at the same visit) and/or incision and drainage. If incision and drainage is performed, participant s should continue using the same over -the- counter antiseptic as previously . New systemic and topical therapies following incision and drainage, including antibiotics, are prohibited. Concomitant use of wound care dressings is allowed as described in Section 6.6.2.4. Participant s should continue using any oral and topical therapies during the study, consistent with the allowances and restrictions described in Section 6.6.2. From Day 1 through Week 8, an intervention can occur on a maximum of 2 different lesions at the same visit or on the same lesion at 2 different study visits. The same les ion cannot be treated 2 times during the same visit. If partic ipant s requi re more than 2 interventions before Week 8, then study drug will be discontinued for those participant s. Study procedures must be performed before any interventions. Any lesion undergoing an intervention will be documented in the lesion count worksheet (s ee Appendix D ). The site will be required to count any lesion that undergoes an intervention as permanently present from the date of the intervention, and must account for it in the source and on the appropriate eCRF. 8.2.5. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Pain Numeric Rating Scale The HS Pain NRS (see Appendix F ) will be completed in a daily diary by participants from screening through EOS . An 11-point scale will be used to assess the worst skin pain and the average skin pain due to HS. Ratings for the 2 items range from 0 (no skin pain) to 10 (skin pain as bad as you can imagine). Assessments will be recorded before bedtime or midnight (whichever comes first) and will be based on a recall period of the last 24 hours. CONFIDENTIAL"

Analgesic Use From screening through EOS , participants will complete a daily diary of their analgesic use (yes/no; see Appendix F ). All analgesics and dose adjustments will be captured in the source and on the appropriate eC RF. 8.2.7. Hidradenitis Suppurativa Patient Global Impression of Change Participants will complete the HS -PGIC questionnaire at the designated study visits listed in Table 3. The HS -PGIC consists of 1 self -administered item that assesses change in the severity of skin in the HS area. Participants are asked to indicate their impression of change compared with their last visit. The participant will answer the following: Since your last visit, your HS is: (1) very much improved, (2) much improved, (3) minimally improved, (4) no change, (5) minimally worse, (6) much worse, or (7) very much worse. The participant should complete the questionnaire before site personnel perform any efficacy assessments. 8.2.8. Dermatology Life Quality Index Participants will complete a DLQI questionnaire (see Appendix G ) from screening through EOS. The DLQI will be used to assess the symptoms and the impact of skin problems on quality of life (Hongbo et al 2005). The DLQI can be used to evaluate 6 areas: symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. Participants will be asked to respond to the 10 items of the DLQI based on a r ecall period of ""the last week."" Decreased scores indicate improved health -related quality of life . The participant should complete the questionnaire before site personnel perform any efficacy assessment s. 8.2.9. Photography of Target Lesions For participants who consent to photography, a target area will be identified at screenin g and photographed for purposes of documentation. The lesion should be located in an area with inflammatory nodules and/or abscesses that are a good representation of the disease sever ity. 8.3. Safety Assessments 8.3.1. Adverse Events Adverse events will be monitore d from the time the participant signs the ICF until at least 28 days after the last dose of study treatment. Adverse events that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse Event Form in the eCRF regardless of the assumption of a causal relationship with the study drug. Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent should be recorded on the Medical History Form in the eCRF. Adverse events (including laboratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible rather than by individual underlying signs and symptoms. Adverse events will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative).

Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant, such as ""How are you feeling?"" is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences. Adverse events may also be detected when they are volunteered by the participant during the screening process or between visits, or through physical examinations, laboratory tests, or other assessments. The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs are described in Section 9. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/cont acts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). 8.3.2. Physical Examinations Physical examinations will be conducted at the time points listed in Table 3. A comprehensive physical exami nation will include height and body weight, and assessment of the following organ or body systems: skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular system; abdomen (liver, spleen); extremities; and lymph nodes. A brief neurologica l examination will also be performed. A targeted physical examination should be conducted as indicated by symptoms reported by the participant, AEs, or other findings. Abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investi gator are to be reported as AEs. Physical examinations must be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed physician, physician's assistant, or an advanced registered nurse practitioner, as local law permits. 8.3.3. Vital Signs Vital sign measurements include blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature. Blood pressure and pulse will be taken with the participant in the recumbent, semirecumbent, or sitting position after 5 minutes of rest. Any abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator are to be reported as AEs. 8.3.4. Electrocardiograms All 12 -lead ECGs will be performed with the participant in a recumbent or semirecumbent position after at least 5 minutes of rest. Electrocardiog rams should be performed as indicated in Table 3. Additional 12- lead ECGs may be performed at other visits as deemed clinically necessary. Electrocardiograms will be interpreted by the investigator at the site, and the results will be used for immediate management of the participant's care. The decision to include or exclude a participant or withdraw a participant from the study based on an ECG flagged as ""Abnormal, Clinically Significant"" is the responsibility of the investigator, in consultation with the sponsor's medical monitor, as CONFIDENTIAL"

Laboratory Assessments 8.3.5.1. Safety Assessments Required l aborat ory tests are listed in Table 10. Safety laboratory tests inclu de hematology, chemistry, CRP , and lipid panel ( see Table 3 ). Participants may have a light snack before thi s visit, but should allow for an overnight fast (at least 8 hours ) before sample collection for the lipid panel. If there is any abnormality in hematology assessment (particular for platelet counts) at Week 2, an unscheduled visit at Week 3 (see Section 8.6) to repeat hematology assessments will be required. Clinical laboratory tests will be performed at a central laboratory (see the Laboratory Manual for sample handling and shipping instructions). 8.3.5.2. Screening Assessments Screening laboratory tests include urinalysis, serology, TB screening , pregnancy test , and an FSH test for confirmation of nonchildbearing status in women who are postmenopausal, defined as amenorrhea at least 12 months before screening . See the Laboratory Manual for screening assessment instructions. 8.3.5.3. Pregnancy Test A serum pregnancy test will be required for all women of childbearing potential during screening.

Definition of Adverse Event Adverse Event Definition • An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug- related. • An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study treatment. Events Meeting the Adverse Event Definition • Any safety assessments (eg, ECG, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying disease). • Abnormal laboratory test results constitute an AE if they are considered clinically meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes in study drug. Whenever possible, a diagnosis (eg, anemia, thrombocytopenia) should be recorded in the eCRF rather than the abnormal lab result (eg, low hemoglobin, platelet count decreased). • Exacerbation of a chronic o r intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. • New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study. • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction. • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication . Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possi ble suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. • ""Lack of efficacy "" or "" failure of expected pharmacological action "" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE . Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE or SAE. Events NOT Meeting the Adverse Event Definition • Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant 's condition. • The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant 's condition or considered to be treatment- related by the investigator. • Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE if it occurred after signing the ICF. If present before entering the study, the condition should be captured as medical history. CONFIDENTIAL"
44,page_44,"Incyte Corporation Page 45 of 78 Protocol INCB 54707- 202 Am 1 Version 1 19 JUL 2018 • Situations in w hich an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). • Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 9.2. Definit ion of S erious Adverse Event If an event is not an AE per the definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease). A Serious Adverse Event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a. Results in death b. Is life -threatening The term ""life-threatening "" in the definition of ""serious"" refers to an adverse drug experience that places the participant, in the opinion of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred . This does not include an adverse drug experience that , had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. c. Requires inpatient hospitalizat ion or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not ha ve been appropriate in the physician' s office or outpatient setting . Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs . If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether ""hospitalization "" occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d. Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity • The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person 's ability to conduct normal life functions. • This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance , such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influe nza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle), that may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f. Other situations (Important Medical Event ): An event that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Recording an Adverse Event and/or S erious Adverse Event Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Recording • An AE/SAE that begins or worsens after informed consent is signed should be recorded on the Adverse Event Form in the eCRF. Conditions that were present at the time informed consent was given should be recorded on the Medical History Form in the eCRF. • Whe n an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. • The investigator (or delegate) will then record all relevant AE/SA E information in the eCRF. • It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant 's medical records to sponsor or designee in lieu of completion of the AE eCRF page. • There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission. • The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the ev ent based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information . Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported a s a separate AE/SAE. To the extent possible, each AE/SAE should be evaluated to determine: • The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 to 5). See below for further instructions on the assessment of intensity. • Whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study drug: suspected (yes) or not suspected (no). See below for further instructions on the assessment of causality. • The start and end dates, unless unresolved at final follow -up. • The action taken with regard to study drug as a result of the AE/SAE(s). • The event outcome (eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown). • The seriousness, as per the SAE definition provided in Section 9.2. • The action taken with regard to the event. Note: If an AE is treated with a concomitant medication or nondrug therapy, this action should be recorded on the Adverse Event Form, and the treatment should be specified on the appropriate eCRF (eg, Prior/Concomitant Medications, Procedures and Non-Drug Therapy). Assessment of Intensity The severity of AEs will be assessed using CTCAE v4.03 Grades 1 through 5. If an event is not classified by CTCAE, the severity of the AE will be graded according to the scale below to estimate the grade of severity. The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the following categories: • Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. • Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age appropriate activities of d aily living. • Grade 3: Severe or medical significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of daily living.

46,page_46,"Incyte Corporation Page 47 of 78 Protocol INCB 54707- 202 Am 1 Version 1 19 JUL 2018 • Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. • Grade 5: Fatal . Assessment of Causality • The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. • A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than that a relationship cannot be ruled out. • The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. • The investigator w ill also consult the RSI in the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. • Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration will be considered and investigated. • For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. • With regard to assessing causality o f SAEs: − There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to the sponsor or designee. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to sponsor or designee . − The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send a SAE follow- up report with the updated causality assessment. Follow -Up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events • The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the sponsor or designee to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE/ SAE as fully as possibl e. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other healthcare professionals. • If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow-up period, the investigator will provide the sponsor or designee with a copy of any postmortem findings, including histopathology. • New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed e CRF. • Any updated SAE data to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of receipt of the information. • Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it has resolved or until it is judged to be permanent; assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected re lationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat the event, and the outcome. • When the severity of an AE changes over time for a reporting period (eg, between visits), each change in severity will be reported as a separate AE until the even t resolves.

Reporting of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs , regardless of suspected causality (eg, relationship to study drug or study procedure[s] ), occurring after the participant has signed the ICF through the last study visit (or 28 days after the last dose of study treatment, whichever occurs later) must be reported to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence, unless otherwise specified by the Protocol. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE information after conclusion of the study participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must notify the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. If the SAE is not documented in the IB for the study drug (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the spo nsor's study drug, the sponsor or its designee may urgently require further information from the investigator for reporting to health authorities. The sponsor or its designee may need to issue an Investigator Notification to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC, or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC , and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for SUSARs according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator's Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. CONFIDENTIAL"
48,page_48,"Incyte Corporation Page 49 of 78 Protocol INCB 54707- 202 Am 1 Version 1 19 JUL 2018 Serious Adverse Event Reporting • Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Adverse Event Form in the eCRF. • The investigator must also complete the In cyte Serious Adverse Event Report Form, in English. Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Serious Adverse Event Report Form. • Facsimile or email transmission of the Serious Adverse Event Report Form is the preferred met hod to transmit this information to the PhV/designee . The contact information of the sponsor's study- specific representatives is listed in the investigator manual provided to each site. The original copy of the Serious Adverse Event Report Form and the c onfirmation sheet must be kept at the study site. • Follow- up information is r ecorded on an amended or new Serious Adverse Event Report Form, with an indication that it is follow -up to the previously reported SAE and the date of the original report. The fol low-up report should include information that was not provided on the previous Serious Adverse Event Report Form, such a s the outcome of the event (eg , resolved or ongoing), treatment provided, action taken with study drug because of the SAE (eg , dose reduced, interrupted, or discontinued), or participant disposition (eg , continued or withdrew from study participation). Each recurrence, complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as follow-up to that event, regardless of when it occurs. • In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile or computer equipment, notification by telephone is acceptable with a copy of the Incyte Serious Adverse Event Report Form sent by overnight mail or courier service. Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and sign the Serious Adverse Event Report Form within the designated reporting time frames. • Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the study manual. 9.5. Emergency Unblinding of Treatment As signment Not applicable. 9.6. Pregnancy Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that study drug may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication or method. When a pregnancy has been confirmed in a participant's partner during paternal exposure to study drug, the following procedures should be followed in order to ensure safety: • The investigator must complete and submit the Incyte Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form to the sponsor or its designee within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. Data on fetal outcomes are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety evaluation. Follow-up should be conducted for each pregnancy to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by following until the first well-baby visit. Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form and reported by the investigator to the sponsor or its designee. Pregnancy follow-up information should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible causal relationship to the sponsor's study drug to any pregnancy outcome, as well as follow- up to the first well- baby visit or the duration specified in local regulations, whichever is later. Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form. CONFIDENTIAL"

Warnings and Precautions Special warnings or precautions for the study drug, derived from safety information collected by the sponsor or its designee, are presented in the IB. Additional safety information collected between IB updates will be communicated in the form of Investigator Notifications . Any important new safety information should be discussed with the participant during the study, as necessary . If new significant risks are identified, they will be added to the ICF. 9.8. Product Complaints The sponsor collects product complaints on study drugs and drug delivery systems used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safety of study participant s, monitor quality, and facilitate process and product improvements. All product complaints associated with material packaged, labeled, and released by the sponsor or its designee will be reported to the sponsor. All product complaints associated with other study material will be reported directly to the respective manufacturer. The investigator or his/her designee is responsible for reporting a complete description of the product complaint via email or other written communication to the sponsor contact or respective manufacturer as noted in the packaging information. Any AE associated with a product complaint should be recorded as described in Section 9.3. If the investigator is asked to return the product for investigation, he/she will return a copy of the product complaint communication with the product. 9.9. Treatment of Overdose For this study, any dose of INCB054707 greater than 15 mg within a 24- hour time period will be considered an overdose. Sponsor does not recommend speci fic treatment for an overdose. In the event of an overdose, the investigator should: • Contact the medical monitor immediately. • Closely monitor the participant for any AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities until INCB054707 can no longer be detected systemically (at least 3 days). • Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis within 3 days from the date of the last dose of study treatment if requested by the medical monitor (determined on a case- by-case basis). • Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in the eCRF. Decisions regar ding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the medical monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. CONFIDENTIAL"

INFORMATION REGARDING EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTRACEPTIVE METHODS For male participants in the study: Male parti cipants should use a condom during treatment and through 90 days after the end of systemic exposure. If the male participant has a partner that is of childbearing potential, the partner should also use contraception through 90 days after the end of releva nt systemic exposure. In addition, male participants must refrain from donating sperm during the study through 90 days after the end of relevant systemic exposure. Males who have had a vasectomy qualify as having met the requirement for a highly effectiv e birth control method. For female participants and for female partners of male participants in the study: The following methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly are considered as highly effective birth control methods. Such methods include: • Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation − oral − intravaginal − transdermal • Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation − oral − injectable − implantable 1 • Intrauterine device (IUD)1 • Intrauterine hormone- releasing system (IUS)1 • Bilateral tubal occlusion1 • Vasectomised partner1,2 • Sexual abstinence3 Acceptable birth control methods that result in a failure rate of more than 1% per year include: • progestogen-only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action • male or female condom with or without spermicide4 • cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide4 • tubal ligation 1 Contraception methods that in the context of this guidance are considered to have low user dependency. 2 Vasectomised partner is a highly effective method of avoiding pregnancy provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman and that the vas ectomised partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success. 3 In the context of this guidance, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. 4 A combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide (double barrier methods) are also considered acceptable, but not highly effective, birth control methods.
