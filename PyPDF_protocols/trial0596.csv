MS patients who are starting their first treatment for MS currently can be trea ted with various oral or injectable medications. When solely considering t he route of administration of these medications it may appear that the oral treatments are more patient frie ndly and convenient than the in jectable ones. In addition, certain weekly o r daily first-line injection treatments may be preferred over thrice weekly injections for unknown reas ons. In clinical trials, discontinuation rates due to adverse events (AE s) of dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera®) and of teriflunomide (Aubagio®) treated patients is 16% in both DEFINE and TENERE studies, respectively. Furthermore, injectable treatment discontinuation v a r i e s between 14% and 47%. It is important for patients to optimally utilize first-line MS treatment options before escalating therapy to mo re potentially dangerous second line therapies such as natalizumab , fingolimod or alemtuzumab. This Phase IV clinical study is being proposed to support decisi on making for health care professi onals (HCPs) and patients who ha ve decided to initiate MS treatment, and use arguments of patient friendliness and convenience for their decision. Therefore, in this study treatment satisfaction of Rebif is measured in MS patients who have discontinued their initial MS treatment, and who have decided t o start Rebif as their follow-up treatme nt. Currently there is no infor mation describing the experiences with d iscontinuation of oral or inje ctable medication and the initiation of the injectable therapy Rebif. This information is crucial for HCPs a nd patients to be able to make a well informed decision on what to expect of their treatment.

17,page_17,"Interferon beta-1a MESTRE–MS Study EMR200136_597 7 Rational and Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory, autoimmune, demyelinating disease that affects the central nervous system (1). Relapsing remitting MS (R RMS) is the most common type of MS, affecting approximate ly 80% to 85% of all patients w ith MS, and is characterized by unpredictable acute attacks (known as relapses) accompanied by w orsening of symptoms, followed by periods of remission during which there is a full o r partial recovery from the deficits acquired during the relapse (2). Relapse activity is associated with an increased risk of disability progression (3 ), although disability can advance independently of relapse activ ity (secondary progressive MS) (4). The increasing number of first-line and seco nd-line treatment options, together with the variable course of the disease and patient li festyles and expectations, makes the therapeutic decision a real challenge (5). Disease Modifying Drugs an d Interferon beta –la (IFN ȕ-1a) treatment Treatment of RRMS typically consists of direct symptom manageme nt, brief corticosteroid administration for acute exacerbations, and the regular use of D isease Modifying Drugs (DMDs). Currently approved immunomodulator treatments for RRMS include recombinant beta LQWHUIHURQV ,)1ȕ -1a, Avonex® ,)1ȕ -1a, Rebif®; ,)1ȕ -1b, Betaferon® and Extavia®) and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone® ). Additional first-line immunosup pressant therapies include dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera®) and teriflunomide (Aubagio®). Nat alizumab (Tysabri®), alemtuzumab (Lemtrada®), and fingolimod (Gilenya®) are also ava ilable for treatment of MS as second-line therapy in more severe disease (6), while in Switze rland fingolimod can be prescribed as first-line medication. Interferons are a family of naturally occurring proteins that a re produced by eukaryotic cells in response to viral infections and other biological inducers. Hum an interferons have anti-inflammatory, antiviral and antigrowth properties. They ex ert their biological effect by binding to specific receptors on the surface of cells, initiati ng a complex cascade of intracellular events; however the mechanism of action of IFN ȕ-1a in MS remains unclear. Rebif is a human IFN ȕ-1a used for the treatment of MS. The amino acid sequence of Re bif is identical to the natural interferon derived from human fibrobla sts. ,)1ȕ -1a is produced by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology using genetic ally engineered Chinese hamster ovary cells into which t he human gene has been inserted ( 7,8). Rebif Drug information The currently marketed formulation of Rebif ( ,)1ȕ -1a) has been evaluated in a series of well controlled MS studies which have demonstrated that Rebif signif icantly reduces clinical attack rate, magnetic resonance image le sion activity, accumulation of new lesion burde n, and disability progression (9, 10,11,12,13). Rebif is the only disease modi fying agent for MS available to day to have demonstrated efficacy on all four of these efficacy measures in RRMS. Long term data have also demonstrated that Rebif at either 22 mcg or 44 mcg thr ee times a week maintains these clinical benefits in a dose related manner ( 14,15,16) and that high frequency administration, C O N F I D E N T I A L I N F O R M A T I O N18/60"
18,page_18,"Interferon beta-1a MESTRE–MS Study EMR200136_597 i.e., three times a week, at the highest dose available, i.e., 44 mcg, provides more clinical benefit than 30 mcg administered once a week ( 17). Existing data show that, overall, Rebif is well tolerated at th e doses intended for use in the MS population, namely 44 mcg three times a week administered by the subcutaneous route. The 22 mcg three times a week dosage is recommended for patients who c annot tolerate the high dose. Patients using Rebif are likely to experience the known un desirable effects to interferon, such as influenza-like-syndrome; injection site reaction (from t he common mild inflammatory reactions to the uncommon injection site necroses); asymptomati c hepatic enzymes abnormalities, especially alanine a minotransferase elevation; wh ite and red blood cell counts decrease; and skin reactions, usually rash. The majority of adve rse reactions (ARs) observed with Rebif is usually mild and re versible, and respond well to d ose reductions. Details are disclosed in the currently approve d product information (for fur ther information, please see the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) ( 18). Since its introduction in the market in 1998, the cumulative ex posure to Rebif by end of March 2014 can be estimated to amount to more than 1,259,436 patient- years in the post marketing setting. During 15 years of Rebif's post-marketing surveillance a series of adverse events (AEs) have been identified, such as ARs, including Quincke's edema, an aphylaxis, urticaria, serious cutaneous reactions, including S tevens-Johnson syndrome, hepati tis with or without icterus, or injection site infection and cellulitis, which could be severe, as with any protein therapeutic agent, cases of thrombotic microangiopathy including fatal case s, have been reported during treatment of MS with interferon be ta products. Most thrombotic mi croangiopathy cases presented as thrombotic thromboc ytopenic purpura or haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Rebif therapy may induce the formation of antibodies. Despite the ful l significance of the formation of neutralizing antibodies remains unclear, it may represent an ef ficacy rather than a safety issue (11,12,13,19,20,21,22 ,23,24,25). An electronic, handheld, multi dose, autoinjection device that i ncorporates a dosing history log has been developed to improve t he injection experience, patient satisfaction and treatment adherence among patients sel f-administering subcutaneous ,)1ȕ -1a. In a multicentre, international user trial, this device was considered 'very suit able' or 'suitable' for self-injection by 71.6% of patients and 92.2% reporte d some degree of suitability (26). The incidence of infusion site reactions was decreased with the autoinjector compared to m anual injection, coupled with ease of use of the autoinjector , suggest that it could improve compliance, and therefore therapeutic outcomes in some patients ( 27). Cramer et al., showed the evidence of significant improvements in all subscales of the MS treatment concerns ques tionnaire, including global patient satisfaction (but with the exception of ‘flu-like’ symp toms), and all pain measures after patients with MS switched from us ing the RJ auto injector to the RJII device ( 28).

19,page_19,"Interferon beta-1a MESTRE–MS Study EMR200136_597 Study Rationale Since MS is a currently incurable, chronic disease, long term D MD therapy is required, necessitating commitment from patients to continue their treatm ent (29). Patient’s and health care profe ssionals (HCPs) decision for MS t reatment frequently is based on subjective perception of convenience. Some patients may need to discon tinue their MS treatment due to la ck of efficacy or side effects. At present, there is limited real world information regarding wh ich therapy provides the best clinical response in patients wit h RRMS following a switch (2). MS patients who are starting their first treatment for MS curren tly can be treated with various oral or injectable medications. When solely considering the rou te of administration of these medications it may appear that the oral treatments are more pati ent friendly and convenient than the injectable ones. In addition, certain weekly or daily first -line injection treatments may be preferred over thrice weekly injections for unknown reasons. In clinical trials, discontinuation rates due to AEs of dimethyl fumar ate (Tecfidera) and of teriflu nomide (Aubagio) treated patients are 16% in both DEFINE and TENERE studies, respectively . Furthermore, injectable treatment discontinuation va ries between 14% and 47% ( 20). It is important for patients to optimally utilize first-line MS treatment options before escala ting therapy to more potentially dangerous second line therapies such as natalizumab, fingolimod o r alemtuzumab. This Phase IV clinical study is being proposed to support decisi on making for HCPs and patients who have decided to initiate MS treatment, and use arguments of patient friendliness and convenience for their decision. Therefore, in this study treatm ent satisfaction of Rebif is measured in MS patients who have discontinued their initial MS treatment, and who have decided to start Rebif as their follow-up treatment.

Approximately 133 patients will be enrolled at approximately 33 centers in Euro pe (the Netherlands, Switzerland and Belgium) over a period of 1 year. The reasons for discontinuing oral or injectable first-line MS t reatment in daily clinical practice currently are not well described. Furthermore, the treatment sa tisfaction of patients who are treated with injectable MS medication after discontinuing oral treatment is unknown. Whether an association between treatment satisfaction or quality of life on t h e o n e h a n d a n d t r e a t m e n t adherence, ARR and reasons for d iscontinuation on the other exi st also is not known and will be investigated as part of this study. As part of the secondary measures in this study ARR will be meas ured, and the potential association between clinical effect and medication change will be investigated. Furthermore, therapy adherence will be measured with RebiSmart 2.0 in MS pati ents who have discontinued their initial oral or injectable MS treatment and have decided to start Rebif treatment. In order to be able to analyze a broader spectrum of convenience perception and satisfaction of treatment also the MusiQoL questionnaire is completed by the patient and a potential correlation between these quality of life outcomes a nd clinical measures will be exp lored. The study consists of 3 visits including Visit 1 (Baseline), Visi t 2 (Month 6) and Visit 3 (Month 12). At Baseline, Month 6 and 12 visits, the TSQM v II and M usiQoL will be measured, and relapses and adherence will be measured at Month 6 and 12 visit s. Adherence to Rebif therapy will be collected elect ronically using RebiSmart 2.0. The reason for discontinuation of the initial treatment will be r equested by the study team and documented in the patient file at the Baseline Visit. The colle ction of AEs will be a regular part of each visit and will be documen ted and communicated according to safety policies. Since this is an observational study to observe the usual practi ce, there will not be any study required clinical interventi ons and laboratory assessments. Upon site initiation, each inves tigator site will enroll subjec ts who meet the eligibility criteria. Enrollment will be in a consecutive manner until the site enrol lment target is reached. The recruitment period is planned to be between September 2016 and Se ptember 2017. However, this may be extended if the recruitment target is not met.

Primary Endpoint variables: xTreatment Satisfacti on Questionnaire for Medication Version II ( 31) TSQM v II was designed as a gene ral measure of treatment satisf action with medication, suitable for use across a wide variety of medication types and illness c onditions. Findings in the development of this questionnair e indicated that the three dime nsions on which patients evaluate their medication are: effectiven ess, adverse effects and conven i e n c e . T h e r e w a s a n a d d i t i o n a l overall satisfaction rating, representing individual balanced j udgment across these three specific treatment attributes, potentially most predictive of patient sa tisfaction and adhe rence. The final version of the questionna ire is included in Appendix 1 . TSQM v II evaluation will be done at Baseline, Month 6 and Month 1 2. Secondary Endpoint variables: xAnnualized relapse rate ARR is defined as the number of relapses per year and will be ca lculated using the below formula Annualized Relapse Rate = (No. of Relapses / Time on Study) × 36 5.25 where, Time on Study (days) = (Date of Study Completion or Date of study discontinuation - Date of first Rebif administration +1) A relapse is defined as the appearance of a new clinical sign or symptom attributable to MS, or FOLQLFDOZRUVHQLQJRIDSUHYLRXVVLJQRUV\PSWRPWKDWKDGEHHQ VWDEOHIRUGD\VDQGWKDW SHUVLVWHGIRUK ours without fever.

Relapse history will be collected at Baseline and relapse asses sment will be done at Month 6 and Month 12. ARR before study entry will be compared to ARR at stud y end. xMultiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life Questionnaire (MusiQoL) ( 32) To evaluate health-related qualit y of life, all subjects will b e asked to complete the MusiQoL. The MusiQoL is a disease-specific validated 31-item multi-dimen sional, self-administered questionnaire. It has nine dimensions: xActivities of daily liv ing (ADL, 8 items); xPsychological well-being (PWB, 4 items); xSymptoms (SPT, 3 items); xRelationships with fri ends (RFr, 4 items); xRelationships with f amily (RFa, 3 items); xRelationship with the health care system (RHCS, 3 items); xSentimental and sexual life (SSL, 2 items); xCoping (COP, 2 items); and xRejection (REJ, 2 items). Each item is scored from 1 (neve r/not at all) to 5 (always/very much) or 6 if not applicable. Negatively worded item scores are reversed so that higher score s indicated a higher level of quality of life. All nine dimensions are linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scal e, where 0 indicates the worst possible level of quality of lif e and 100 indicates the best leve l. The index score is computed as the mean of these subscales scores. If fewer than half of the items were missing, the mean of the n on-missing items is substituted for the missing items. The final version of the que stionnaire is included in Appendix 2. MusiQoL evaluation will be done a t Baseline Visit, Month 6 and M onth 12.

Risk base d monitoring is the process of ensuring the quality of clinical trials by identifying, assessi ng, monitoring and mitigating the risks that could affect the quality or safety of a study. It can facilitate efficient trial delivery without compromising patient saf ety or data quality. A Sponsor or an appointed CRO will identify critical data and processes, performs a risk assessmen t and then develops a monitoring plan that focuses on the important and likely risks to critical data and processes. A Sponsor or an appointed CRO Monitor may perform visits to the site, if required, at any time during the study. For hospitals where potential quality risks ar e identified, on-site visits can verify that the study is bein g carried out according to the pro tocol. 9.8.2 Archiving The archive should be maintaine d for the period specified by lo cal regulations, where applicable. All original subject files (medical records) must be stored at the site (hospital, research institute, or practice) for the longest possible time permitted by the app licable regulations. In the absence of applicable regulations, the ar chive should be maintained for at least 5 years after the final study report or the first publication of study results, whichev er comes later. In any case, the Investigator should ensure that no destruction of medical record s is performed without the written approval of the Sponsor. 9.8.3 Quality Assurance and Audit In compliance with regulatory requirements, the Sponsor, a thir d party on behalf of the Sponsor, regulatory agencies, or IEC/IRB may conduct quality assurance a udits/inspections at any time during or following a study. The Investigator must agree to all ow auditors/inspectors direct access to all study related documents, including source document s, and must agree to allocate his or her time and the time of his or her study staff to the audit ors/inspectors in order to discuss findings and issues. The protocol, each step of the data capture procedure, and the handling of the data, as well as the eventual study report, will be subject to independent clinical quality assurance. Audits may be conducted at any time during or a fter the study to ensure the v alidity and integrity of the study data. 9.9 Limitations of the Research Methods This study is open label and observational, and therefore has in herent limitations in terms of susceptibility to bias, confounding and restricting the ability to define causality. There is limited control over patient assessment as patient monitoring and diagn ostics are per standard of care; no additional clinical monitoring is generally conducted .Patient specific methodological challenges such as potential biases from patient selecti on, loss of patien ts through study attrition, and overall patient recall are also other limitations.

The IEC/ IRB will be asked to provide documentation of the date of the meeting at which the favorable opinion/approval was given, and of the members and voting member s present at the meeting. Writt en evidence of favorable opinion/approval that clearly ide ntifies the study, the protoco l version, and the subject information and consent form v ersion reviewed should be provide d. Where possible, copies of the meeting minutes should be obtained. Amendments to the protocol will also be submitted to the concer ned IEC/IRB, before implementation in case of substantial changes. 10.2 Subject Information and Informed Consent An unconditional prerequisite for a subject’s participation in the study is his/her written informed consent. The subject’s written informed consent to participate i n the study must be given before any study related activities are carried out. Adequate information must there fore be given to the subject by the Investigator before informed consent is obtained (a person de signated by the Investigator ma y give the information, if permitted by local regulations). A subject information sheet in the local language will be provided by the Sponsor for the purpose of obtaining informed c onsent. In addition to providing this written information to a potential subject, the Investigat or or his/her designee will inform the subject verbally of all pertinent aspects of the study (the lan guage used in doing so must be chosen so that the information can be fully and readily underst ood by laypersons).

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintende d sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated w i t h t h e u s e o f a m e d i c i n a l product, whether or not considere d related to the medicinal pro duct. Adverse Reaction An AR is a response to a medic inal product which is noxious and unintended. Response in this context means that a causal relationship betwe en a medicinal product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility. ARs may arise from use of the p roduct within or outside the ter ms of the marketing authorisation or from occupational exposure. C onditions of use outside the ma rketing authorisation include off-label use, overdose, misuse , abuse and medication errors. Serious Adverse Event/Serious Adverse Reaction A SAE/reaction is any AE/AR as defined above, which also fulfills at least one of the seriousness criteria below: xResults in death xIs life-threatening1) xRequires in-patient hospitaliza tion or prolongation of existing hospitalization xResults in persistent or signi ficant disability/incapacity xIs a congenital anomaly/birth defect xIs otherwise considered as medically important2) C O N F I D E N T I A L I N F O R M A T I O N37/60"
37,page_37,"Interferon beta-1a MESTRE–MS Study EMR200136_597 1)Life-threatening in this context refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction tha t hypothetically might have caused death if more severe. 2)Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in decidin g whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medica l events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalisati on but might jeopardise the patient or might require interven tion to prevent one of the oth er outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dysc rasias or convulsions that do n ot result in hospitalisation or development of dependency or abuse. Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infect ious agent is also considered a serious AR. Events not to be considered as AEs Medical conditions present at study start, that do not worsen i n severity or frequency during the study are defined as Baseline medical conditions, and are NOT t o be considered AEs. 11.2 Severity of Adverse Events Investigators should assess the se verity/intensity of any AEs as follows: Mild: The subject is aware of the event or symptom, but the event or symptom is easily tolerated. Moderate: The subject experiences sufficient discomfort to interfere with or reduce his or her usual leve l of activity. Severe: Significant impairment of functioning: the subject is unable to carry out usual activities. 11.3 Causality Assessment Investigators must assess the cau sal relationship between AEs an d study drug (including any other non-medicinal product, rad iation therapy, etc.) consideri ng temporal relationship between the AE onset and study drug administration, safety profile of s tudy drug (known side effects), the patient's condition (medical history, underlying disease), conc omitant medication, and study procedures. Related: Suspected to be reasonably re lated to any study medication. Not related: Not suspected to be reasonably related to any study medication. A reasonable alternative explana tion must be available. C O N F I D E N T I A L I N F O R M A T I O N38/60"

All SAEs (related a nd not related) and non SAE s (related AEs) mu st be collected in the eCRF. Each AE, as specified above, occurring during the study, must be documented by the Investigator within 24 hours of awareness and must be recorded i n the eCRF, including its description, severity, duration (onset and resolution dates), c ausal relationship (i.e., confirmation that the AR is suspected to be reasonably related to the study t r e a t m e n t ) , a n y o t h e r p o t e n t i a l causal factors, actions taken with the study drug (dose reducti on, withdrawal), required treatment, and outcome. In add ition, for all serious ARs, serio usness criteria must be documented and a specific safety report fo rm must be completed and sent to the Sponsor, as de scribed below Death, disability, and hospitalization are considered outcomes in the context of safety reporting and not usually considered ARs/AEs. Therefore the primary cause of death, disability or hospitalization should be recorded and reported as an SAE/AR, a nd the outcome should be recorded in a separate data field. However, a term for the outc ome will be selected if it is the only information reported or provide s significant clinical info rmation. If death occurs, the primary cause of death or event leading to death should be recorded and reported as an SAE. “Fatal” will be recorded as the OUTCOME of this respective event and not be as separate event. Only, if no cause of death can be reporte d (for example, sudden death, unexplained death), the death per se might then be reported as an SAE. Medication Errors, Overdose, Abuse, and Misuse Events of medication errors, overdose, abuse and misuse of stud y drug are also to be recorded in the eCRF, even if occurring without AE. Pregnancy and Lactation If encountered on this study exposure to study drug during preg nancy or lactation is to be recorded in the eCRF and to be r eported to the study sponsor. 11.5 Safety Reporting to the Study Sponsor Safety data collection forms: The following safety data coll ection forms are used in this stu dy: xSAE Report Form xPregnancy Report Form xParent-Child/Foetus AE Report Form C O N F I D E N T I A L I N F O R M A T I O N39/60"
39,page_39,"Interferon beta-1a MESTRE–MS Study EMR200136_597 Reportable events: The following events are reportable to the Safety Check Desk at CRO within 24 hours of awareness: xAll SAEs (related or unrelated) a re to be reported independent o f their relationship to the study drug by using the SAE report form. xNon-serious ARs*) xPregnancies to be reported indepe ndent of the relationship to an A E b y u s i n g t h e Pregnancy Report Form. xAll events that occur in a Child/Foetus of a pregnant woman who was exposed to the study drug are to be reported by using the Parent-Child/Foetus Report Form xSpecial considerations including medication errors, overdose, a buse, misuse; exposure during pregnancy and/or lactatio n should be reported on the SAE report form by indicating whether serious or not. *) All non-serious suspected adverse drug reactions (related to any study medication) only need to be recorded in the eCRF; those are downloaded daily by the Sponsor i nto the Sponsor Global Drug Safety Database. Procedure for Safety Data Reporti ng (completion and forwarding) : In the event of any new safety data that have to be reported as specified above, the Investigator must immediately (within 24 hours after becoming aware of the e vent) inform the Sponsor or its designee. For all events that require a written form to the Spo nsor, the Investigator completes the respective Safety Data Collection Form within 24 hours in English and sends the report by email or fax to the CRO Safety Check Desk. The Investigator must respo nd to any request by CRO for follow-up information within the same timeline as noted above f or initial reports for further forwarding the report to the Gl obal Drug Safety.

T he minimum information to be included in the initial report is the following: xInvestigator name and contact details xSubject identification (e. g., ID number, sex, age) xProduct (including lot/ batch number) xDescription of SAE/ Adverse Drug Reaction/ Special consideratio ns The report should contain causalit y and seriousness information (for AEs) and must be signed off by the Investigator. When AE information is communicat ed via telephone, a written/ele ctronic data capture (EDC) report must be sent immediately within 24 hours thereafter by f ax or e-mail. In such cases the “clock start” for case reporting to Health Authorities is the da te and time of the telephone communication. Exposure during Pregnancy All pregnancies with an estimated conception date in the period from the date of informed consent signature (where applicable) until the last post-treatmen t safety visit, or as defined in the protocol, must be recorded by c onvention in the AE page/section of the eCRF. The same rule applies to pregnancies in female subjects and to pregnancies in female partners of male subjects. The Investigator must notify the Sponsor in an expedited manner of any pregnancy using the Pregnancy Report Form, which must be transmitted according to t he same process as described for SAE reporting. The Sponsor m ust be notified about any pregn ancy independent whether the pregnancy is associated with an AE or not. Investigators must actively follow up, document, and report to the Sponsor on the outcome of all these pregnancies and deliveries even if the subject is withdraw n from the study. If an abnormal outcome occurs, the respective safety data collection form (Pre gnancy Report Form, Parent-Child/Foetus AE Report Form) is to be completed and sent to the Sponsor. Procedure for Follow-up information The Investigator must promptly respond to any request for follo w-up information or questions from the Sponsor or delegate (e. g. CRO). Such requests will be sent to the Investigator via the CRO Safety Check Desk. SAEs occurring during the study must be mo nitored and followed up by the Investigator until stabilization or until the outcome is known, unless the subject is lost to follow-up. The Investigator will ensure any necessary additional therapeut ic measures and follow-up procedures are recorded and reported via a follow-up report form . For all serious cases missing information such as outcome, confounders, and causality is to be p rovided.

Reporting of any new information on a previously reported SAE or non-serious adverse drug reaction (follow-up) will follow th e procedures and timelines o f the original report. 11.6 Regulatory Reporting to the Health Authorities Expedited reporting of SAEs a nd non-serious adverse drug reacti ons to Health Authorities is performed by the Sponsor local dru g safety officer/Pharmacovigil ance responsible at shared service center according to app licable global and local require ments. Serious ARs, including those asso ciated with the comparator dru g (if applicable), will be expedited by the Sponsor to Hea lth Authorities according to loc al regulations, which usually require a maximum period of 15 days. In addition, the Investigator will comply with any applicable l ocal pharmacovigilance requirements to repor t appropriate safety data, to national pha rmacovigilance systems (e.g. Yellow Card Scheme in UK), as re quired by country specific repo rting requirements. 12 Plans for Disseminating and Communicating Study Results After completion of the study, the selected CRO shall prepare a final report of study results, in close collaboration with the coor dinating Investigator and the Sponsor. All publications and presenta tions should be based on the final study report. All information provided by the Sponsor regarding this study wi ll be the sole property of the Sponsor and must be considered a s confidential. No confidential information will be disclosed to third parties without the prior written consent of the Sponsor and it will be used only for conducting this study. 12.1 Study Report(s) The completed study will be summa rized in a final report that a ccurately and completely presents the study objectives, methods, results, limitations of the stud y, and interpretation of the findings. 12.2 Publication The first publication will be a publication of the results of t he analysis of the Primary Endpoint that will include data from all study sites. The Investigator will inform the Sponsor in advance about any p lans to publish or present data from the study. Any publications and presentations of the resul ts (abstracts in journals or newspapers, oral presentations, etc.), either in whole or in pa rt, by Investigators or their representatives will require pr e-submission review and approval by the Sponsor.
