PDE -4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. While the specific mechanism(s) by which crisaborole exerts its therapeutic action is not well defined, crisaborole reduces the production of several inflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathophy siology of atopic dermatitis (AD). Supporting e vidence for the safet y and efficacy of this product in patients 2 years and older represent s a major advancement in the treatment of AD given the challenges of managing this common, chronic dermatologic condition and the limitations of currently available therapies. All prima ry and secondary efficacy endpoints were statistically significant in the two previous Phase 3 vehicle -controlled studies , AN2728- AD-301 and AN2728- AD-302. Across the development program, crisaborole demonstrated an acceptable safet y profile; the majority of adverse e vents ( AEs)were mild and deemed unlikely or not related to investigational product, with no crisaborole treatment related serious adverse e vents ( SAEs ) (except 1 case of drug eruption in a Phase 2 study which was classified as possibly relate d). This 4 -week ,randomized, assessor blinded , crisaborole ointment , 2%, vehicle and active (topical corticosteroid [TCS] and topical calcineurin inhibitor [TCI ])controlled study will determine the efficacy and safet yof crisaborole ointment ,2% applied twice daily (BID) compared with vehicle in subjects ages 2 years and older with mild to moderate AD. The study will also e valuate the efficacy and safet yof crisaborole ointment, 2% compared with the active controls; hydrocortisone buty rate cream, 0.1% [TCS] and pimecrolimus cream, 1%[TCI ]. Hence,this study will, provide contextualization of the efficacy and safet yof crisaborole ointment, 2% in the treatment of mild to moderate AD. The crisaborole dose strength and regimen selected for this study has be en demonstrated to be safe, well -tolerated and efficacious in subject s and healthy volunteers 2 y ears of age and older who participated in previous studies. Hydrocortisone but yrate cream ,0.1% and pimecrolimus cream ,1% are approved products for the treatm ent of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in subjects ages 2 years and older, and will be used as per their national approved la bel in this study ."

Treatment will be clinical assessor-blinded for all treatment arms and double-blinded for crisaborole ointment, 2% and vehicle treatment arms. A total of approximately 600 subjects will be enrolled in the study, of which at least 150 subjects aged 2-6; at least 140 subjects aged 7-11; at least 120 subjects aged 12-17 and up to 90 subjects will be adults. Following the screening period (up to 35 days prior to Baseline/Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomized at the Baseline/Day 1 visit. Randomization will be stratified by eligibility for TCS or TCI treatment as per national approved labels. Cohort 1 will be for subjects who are eligible for TCS therapy, and Cohort 2 will be for subjects who are not eligible for TCS therapy but eligible for TCI therapy. The investigational products will be applied BID for 28 days to the Treatable body surface area (BSA) identified at Baseline/Day 1. The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from baseline in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) total score at Day 29. For the efficacy comparison of crisaborole versus vehicle, subjects from both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 are included in the analysis, adjusted for cohort effect. For the efficacy comparison of crisaborole versus TCS, only subjects from Cohort 1 are included in the analysis.

A sub -study will be conducted at selected investigator sites to evaluate differences of changes in epidermal skin thickness as measured by Optical Coherence Tomograph y (OCT) between treatment groups in Cohort 1. ( see Appendix 4). Scheduled study visits for all subjects will occur at Screening, Baseline/Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29 (End of treatment/Earl y termination ), Day 43 or 14 Day s after last dose if subject is terminated earl y from treatment. A follow up telephone call will be made by site staff to the subjects/subject ’slegally acceptable guardian (s)on Day 60 or at least 28 days after last dose if subject is terminated earl y from treatment. The Day 60 visit will be completed in the clinic for subjects enrolled in the OCTsub-study . Refer to the Schedule of Activities for a complete lis t of assessments to be performed during the study. Statistical Methods: The primary endpoint, EASI % change from baseline, as well as other change from baseline continuous endpoints, will be anal yzed using a mixed -effect repeated measures model that includ es the fixed effects of treatment, visit as class variable, treatment b y visit interaction, and baseline value. Within -subject variability will be accounted for using a random effect with the first order autoregressive (AR(1)) covariance matrix. Binary endpoints will be anal yzed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel ( CMH )test. Time to event endpoints will be anal yzed by log rank test and duration of time to event will be estimated b y the product limit method. A Kaplan -Meier plot will be provided. Safety data will be descriptively summarized, and will be presented in tabular and/or graphical format. Sample Size Determination A total of approximately 600 subjects will be enrolled into this study , of which approximately 300 subjects who are eligible to receive T CS therap y (Cohort 1) will be randomized to crisaborole ointment, 2%, the matching vehicle ointment for crisaborole, or TCS with a randomization ratio of1:1:2. Approximately 300 subjects who are ineligible to receive TCS therap y and eligible to receive T CI therapy (Cohort 2) will be randomized to crisaborole ointment ,2%, the matching vehicle ointment for crisaborole, or pimecrolimus cream ,1% with randomization ratio 1:1:2. A sample size of 150 subjects in the crisaborole treatment arm (combined from Coh ort 1 and Cohort 2) and 150 subjects in vehicle treatment arm ( combined from Cohort 1 and C ohort 2) will provide 86% power to detect a 12% difference in EASI percent reduction from baseline atDay 29 between crisaborole and vehicle at the 0.05 (2 -sided) si gnificance level (See Figure 1). The sample size within each Cohort will also provide sufficient precision to enable contextualization of the efficacy of crisaborole in treating subjects with mild to moderate AD"

PDE -4 inhibition results in increased intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. While the specifi c mechanism(s) by which crisaborole exerts its therapeutic action is not well defined, crisaborole reduces the production of several inflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathop hysiology of atopic dermatitis ( AD). Crisaborole ointment, 2% is being devel oped for the topical treatment of patients with mild to moderate AD . On 14 December 2016, EUCRISA (crisaborole) ointment, 2% was approved b y the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of mild to moderate AD in patients 2 years of age and older. 1.2.Background AD, also referred to as atopic eczema or, simpl y as eczema, is a chronic and relapsing disease affecting an increasing number of p erson s. Although AD affects patients of all ages, it is one of the most common, chronic, relapsing childhood dermatoses. The lifetime prevalence of AD is estimated to be 15 -30% in children and 2- 10% in adults while the incidence of AD has increased b y 2-to 3-fold during the past 3 decad es in i ndustrialized countries .1 AD is a distinctive inflammatory , highl y pruritic, chronic eczematous condition that usually occurs in people who have a personal or family history of other atopic conditions such as asthma or allergic rhinitis.2,3 The majority of patients (up to 90%) with AD present with mild to moderate disease.4 Manifestation of the disease includes intense pruritu s, ery thematous papules, excoriation, exudation, lichenification, and bacterial colonization.5 Continuous scratching during exacerbations can lead to lichenification, excoriations, and serious skin infections. AD is often associated with other conditions including asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergy .6,7 AD is a condition associated with significant morbitidty . The burden of the clinical symptoms of AD coupled with the stigma associated with highl y visible skin lesions correlates with significant morbidity and extensive impairments on health related quality of life measures ( HRQOL ) for patients, especiall y in chil dren, and caregivers.2,8,9,10 Psychosocial problems, depression, and anxiet y are associated with AD in both adults and children.11 The negative impact on HRQOL caused by childhood AD exceeds that in asthma, epilepsy , and diabetes, is comparable to that in renal disease or cy stic fibrosis, and is equal (child) or exceeds (parents) that in psoriasis.9,12,13 The hallmark s ymptom of itching causes scratchi ng which is associated with sleep disturbance in greater than 60% of patients. Sleep deprivation leads to ph ysical and mental exhaustion in patients and other family members resulting in loss of concentration and impaired performance at school or work.14,15 AD is often associated with significant childhood behavioral problems and ps ychological disorders including depression, attention deficit hy peractivity disorder, anxiety , stress, and autism.11"
19,page_19,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 20Preschool children with AD show a significant increase in behavioral s ymptoms compared with matched controls.16 Absolon et al17reported that the rate of ps ychological disturbance in school age children with AD doubled compared with matched controls. For older children with AD, in addition to problems associated with itching and sleep distur bance, their social and school life may be substantially affected. Social embarrassment, due to visible signs of the disease (crusted, excoriated, oozing, bleeding lesions), teasing, and bully ing, often results in social isolation leading to depression.12 AD has a significant impact on day to day functioning, as evidenced b y its impact on the overall well -being of the patient and their family on multiple levels; medical management and treatment ;HRQOL ; and psy chosocial implications. I n summary , AD is a disease with multiple comorbidities and significant impact on the health, day to day functioning, and HRQOL of AD patients, their caregivers, and family members. AD may also be a source of significant economic bur den18as this relapsing disease is often misdiagnosed, misunderstood, and ineffectivel y treated.3 Currently , there is no cure for AD. AD is a chronic disease with treatment focused on the management of flares and maintenance of remissions. Due to the chronic, relapsing nature of the disease, treatmen t may be needed for many years. The objectives of AD management are to improve clinical signs and s ymptoms and quality of life, while minimizing potential medication side effects. The main treatment options targeted at the underl ying disease process of mild to moderate AD are topical emollients . Topical corticosteroids (TCS) of vary ing potency , and the topical calcineurin inhibitor ( TCI) pimecrolimus cream ,1% as second line therap y. Emollients, which are fundamental to basic skin care in AD, have limited efficacy . TCSsare limited in the treatment duration and bod y regions of treatment, due to risk of local and potenti ally irreversible skin toxicities such as atrophy , telangiectasia, and striae . Given the potential for inhibition of tumor surveillance in the skin and reports of malignancy (eg, skin and ly mphoma), TCIs are designated as second line therap y for the short- term and non- continuous treatment of AD in non-immuno compromised patients. Crisaborole ointment ,2% was developed by Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Anacor), Palo Alto, California, United States of America ( USA ), which became a wholl y owned subsidiary of Pf izer I nc. on 24 June 2016. Crisaborole is a novel, non- steroidal , topical anti-inflammatory PDE -4 inhibitor being developed for the topical treatment of patients with mild to moderate AD . Supporting e vidence of the safet y and efficacy of this product in patients 2 years and older represent a major advancement in the treatment of AD given the challenges of managing this common, chronic dermatologic condition and the limitations on patient age, location, duration of use and line of therap y of currently avai lable therapies . All primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were statistically significant in favor of crisaborole ointment , 2% BID versus vehicle ointment BID in the two Phase 3 pivotal studies , AN2728 -AD-301 and AN3728 -302.19 Across the development program, crisaborole demonstrated an acceptable safet y profile ; the majority of AEs were mild and deemed"
20,page_20,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 21unlikely or not related to investigational product, with no crisaborole treatment related SAEs (except 1 case of drug eruption in a Phase 2 study which was classified as possibly related) . 1.3.Drug Development Crisaborole ointment, 2% is a benzo oxaborole compound developed as a topical anti-inflammatory agent. Crisaborole has been formulated as a topical ointment. The formulation ingredients for crisaborole ointment, 2% are listed in Section 5. Crisaborole demonstrates in vitro inhibition of a wide range of pro- inflammatory cytokines implicated in the pathogenesis of AD and other inflammatory skin diseases, including TNF -, IFN-y, IL -2, IL -5, IL -6, IL -10, IL -12, and IL -23.20 Crisaborole also inhibits the release of chemokines that are important inflammatory mediators. Crisaborole inhibits the enzy matic activity of PDE -4 through binding to the PDE -4 cataly tic site in a manner that is competitive with cyclic adenosine monophosphate . Crisaborole formulated as ointment and cream formulations for topical use has demonstrated clinical benefit in nine psoriasis clinical studies and seven AD clinical studies. Safet y has been evaluated in a total of 23 completed clinical studies. 1.3.1. Nonclinical Studies Crisaborole demonstrated inhibitory capacit y against human leukocyt e cytokine release with half maximal effective concentration (EC 50) values ranging from high nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations. Crisaborole also inhibits the release of chemokines that are important inflammatory mediators. The primary mechanism of the anti -inflammatory effect of crisaborole is through inhibition of PDE4, which causes elevation of cAMP in leukocytes and subsequent protein kinase A (PKA) -mediated phosphory lation of transcription factors that are important for cy tokine -, chemokine -,or prostaglandin-forming enzy me sy nthesis and release from cells. Crisaborole proved efficacious against an inflammatory challenge in vivo in a mouse phorbol 12- myristate 13 -acetate (PMA )-induced ear edema model. Based on the nonclinical safet y studies conducted to date, crisaborole ointment, 2% has an acceptable safet y profile. 1.3.2. Pharmacokinetics The efficacy of crisaborole for the treatment of AD is not dependent on s ystemic exposure. The development program evaluated s ystemic exposure to crisaborole and its main metabolites relative to establishing the safety of topically applied crisaborole. Systemic exposures to crisaborole following topical application were assessed in healthy volunteers and patients (atopic dermatitis and psoriasis). Based on a nonli near regression analy sisat a given ointment dose, patients will have 2.5 fold higher exposures compared to healthy volunteers .21In pediatric and adolescent subjects (2-17 years) with AD, and in adults w ith psoriasis, crisaborole demonstrated similar pharmacokinetic profiles and sy stemic exposure, irrespective of age and established that following topical application, crisaborole penetrated through the stratum corneum, epidermis, and dermis of human skin, as evidenced b y the presence of crisaborole and its main metabolites in plasma."
21,page_21,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 22Upon reaching the s ystemic circulation, biotransformation of crisaborole is rapid and extensive and primarily consists of oxidative deboronation/hy drolysis to produce AN7602 b y CYP3A4 and CYP1A1/2, followed b y subsequent downstream oxidation of this metabolite to form AN8323, without notable species -related qualitative differences. These two main metabolites of crisaborole observed in plasma following topical application to se veral species, including humans, were found to be inactive against PDE -4. Further, as a result of rapid biotransformation, sy stemic exposure of crisaborole is limited following topical application of crisaborole. In a clinical pharmacokinetic ( PK)study conducted under maximal use conditions (maximal use sy stemic exposure [MUSE] study ) in children and adolescents aged 2-17years with extensive AD (mean treatable percent body surface area [ Treatable % BSA] 48.7%; range 27%- 92%), absorption across the skin w as rapid, with a median time to reach maximum observed plasma concentration (T max) of 3.0 hours on both Day 1 and Day 8(Study AN2728- AD-102). S teady state was achieved within the first 8 days of dosing, with a mean crisaborole maximum observed plasma con centration (C max) of 127ng/mL. Minimal plasma accumulation of crisaborole and AN7602 was observed at steady state whereas AN8323 accumulated in plasma at a rate of 3 -4times that of crisaborole or AN7602, based on mean C max. In a Thorough QT/QTc ( TQT) s tudy (Study AN2728 -TQT- 108) in which healthy subjects were treated with crisaborole ointment ,2% at a therapeutic dose (15 g using an approximate 30% BSA treatment area) or a supratherapeutic dose (45 g, using an approximate 60% BSA treatment area), mean C maxvalues of 36.9 ng/mL and 87.4 ng/mL were observed in therapeutic and supratherapeutic dose groups, respectively, at Day 9. Both therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses had no effect on cardiac repolarization based on results from the primary assessment and the pharmacokinetic -pharmacody namic analysis. 1.3.3. Cutaneous Sensitization, Irritancy Potential and Tolerability 1.3.3.1. Local Tolerability in Sensitive Skin Areas In a study of healthy subjects (16 men and 16 women) who applied c risaborole ointment , 2%BID or vehicle BIDfor 21 days to sensitive area application sites (including extensor areas, intertriginous areas, genitals, and face/hairline), 99% of assessments of local tolerability were graded as 0 (none), with an overall maximum grade of 2 (moderate) and only 0.1% of assessments graded higher than 1 (mild) ( Study AN2728 -PSR- 107). There were no marked differences in burning/stinging, ery thema, or pruritus at any of the application sites over the course of the study between subjects who received crisaborole ointment , 2% or Vehicle. Overall, crisaborole ointment , 2% waswell-tolerated over 21days ofdosing insensitive skin areas ofhealthy subjects."
22,page_22,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 231.3.3.2. Sensitizing and Cumulative Irritation Potential In a repeat -insult patch test and cumulative irritation study in health y subjects (Study AN2728 -RIPT-101), the potential for inducing cutaneous sensitization was assessed in 238 subjects randomized in Cohort 1. None of the subjects demonstrated cutaneous evidence of sensitization potential (a reaction of at least Gra de4 [definite edema] or a pattern suggestive of contact sensitization in the opinion of the Investigator) to the investigational products, c risaborole ointment ,2% or vehicle. The potential for causing cutaneous irritation was evaluated among 40 subjects randomized in Cohort 2. There were no statistically significant differences in irritation between the crisaborole ointment , 2% and vehicle. Crisaborole ointment ,2% and vehicle showed no evidence of sensitization and only very minimal irritation. 1.3.4. Clinic al Experience Seven (7) clinical trials of topical formulations of crisaborole have been completed to date in subjects with AD. Key study information is summarized below. In a multicenter, maximal use, sy stemic exposure (MUSE) study in 34 pediatric subjec ts ranging in age from 2 to 17 years with mild- to-moderate AD who applied crisaborole ointment , 2% BID, subjects had overall blood levels of crisaborole that were low and similar to those previously observed in adults after adjusting for % BSA treated. Absorption across the skin was rapid, with a median T maxof 3.0 hours on both Day 1 and Day 8. In a 4 -week, single arm, open- label safet y, tolerability and PK trial in adolescents with mild-to-moderate AD involving 10 -35% BSA, disease severity improved over the 28 -day treatment period. In a 6 -week bilateral comparison trial of subjects with mild -to-moderate AD, 68% of AD lesions treated with crisaborole ointment ,2% BID showed greater improvement in A topic Dermatitis Severity Index (ADSI ) than vehicle -treated lesions (20%) at 4 weeks (primary endpoint). These response rates were similar at Day 14 and Day 42 (end of treatment). In a 4 -week bilateral comparison trial of 86 adolescent subjects with mild- to-moderate AD, crisaborole ointment , 2% BID showed great er improvement than the lower concentration of crisaborole ointment, 0.5% applied BID for 29 days, and was more efficacious than either concentration applied once daily (QD)."
23,page_23,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 24In two Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, double- blind, vehicle controlled studies in subjects 2years of age and older with mild to moderate AD, crisaborole ointment , 2%outperformed the vehicle in the primary efficacy anal ysis, proportion of subjects achieving success in Investigator’s Static Global Assessment ( ISGA) at Day 29. Succ ess was defined as an (I SGA) score of Clear (0) or Almost Clear (1) with at least a 2 -grade improvement over baseline. Proportion of success was 32.8% and 25.4% for crisaborole ointment ,2% and vehicle, respectivel y in AN2728 -AD-301 and 31.4% and 18.0%, respectivel y in AN2728 -AD-302. The primary efficacy endpoint was met; d ifferences from vehicle were statistically significant in both studies. APhase 3 multicenter, open -label, long -term extension study (AN2728 -AD-303) of crisaborole ointment ,2% for the treatment of mild to moderate AD in adults and children as young as 2 years of age evaluated the long -term safet y of topical crisaborole. Crisaborole ointment, 2% was well -tolerated and no clinically important safet y signals were identified b y this study . In summary , crisaborole has been well -tolerated across completed clinical studies. No clinically important safety signals have been identified in adults and children as y oung as 2years of age. Most AEs have been mild, and most considered unrelated or unlikely to be related to investigational product. The most common drug -related AEs was application site pain (e g,cutaneous stinging and or burning). 1.4.Rationale 1.4.1. Study and Dose Rationale This 4 -week, randomized, assessor blinded, vehicle and active (TCS a nd TCI ) controlled study will determine the efficacy of crisaborole ointment ,2% applied BID compared with vehicle and evaluate the efficacy of crisaborole ointment, 2% applied BID compared with a TCS orTCI, in subjects age s2 years and older with mild to moderate AD. The study will also e valuate the efficacy and safet y of crisaborole ointment, 2% compared with the active controls; hy drocortisone buty rate cream, 0.1% [TCS] and pimecrolimus cream, 1% [TCI ]. Hence,this study will, provide contextualizatio n of the efficacy and safet y of crisaborole ointment, 2% in the t reatment of mild to moderate AD. In the current treatment paradigm of mild to moderate AD there are onl y two main topical treatment options – TCS and the TCI pimecrolimus cream 1% (Elidel). To fully inform the position of crisaborole ointment, 2% in relation to the available topical treatments for mild to moderate AD, both the TCS hydrocortisone but yrate cream 0.1% (a standard of care treatment) and pimecrolimus cream ,1% (a second line trea tment) have been included as active comparators. The study will therefore provide contextualization of the efficacy of crisaborole ointment, 2% in the treatment of mild to moderate AD compared with hydrocortisone but yrate cream ,0.1% and pimecrolimus cream, 1%."
24,page_24,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 25The dose strength and regimen of crisaborole for this study has been shown to be safe, well-tolerated and efficacious in subjects and healthy volunteers 2 y ears of age and older who participated in previously conducted studies. Crisaborole ointment, 2% applied BID was studied in two Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies, and a Phase 3 open -label long -term safety study . Data from the two controlled studies showed a statistically significant therapeutic effect compared to vehi cle with no safety concerns in subjects 2 years and older. In the subsequent Phase 3 open -label extension study , crisaborole ointment ,2% applied BID, demonstrated that long -term use was well -tolerated and not associated with an y systemic safet y signals. Dose selection for the previous Phase 3 clinical studies was based on the safet y and efficacy results from Phase 2 studies. The Phase 2 Study AN2728- AD-204 compared two concentrations of crisaborole (2% and 0.5%) applied QD or BID in adolescents (12to 17.9years of age) with mild to moderate AD. The largest dose -related response and the greatest improvement in all 5 component signs and sy mptoms of AD occurred in the crisaborole 2% BID group, with a notable reduction from baseline in the pruritus score. The safet y of the 2% dosage strength was confirmed in additional studies, including maximal use systemic exposure ( MUSE ) studies (pediatric subjects with AD and adult subjects with psoriasis) and with supra -therapeutic dosing in a TQT study (healthy adult subjects) . This study will evaluate crisaborole ointment , 2%applied BID, a dose strength and regimen that has been demonstrated to be safe, well- tolerated and efficacious. Hydrocortisone but yrate cream ,0.1% and pimecrolimus cream ,1% are approved product s for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in subjects ages 2years and older, and will be used as per national approved label in this study . 1.4.2. Benefit/Risk Assessment This study will evaluate crisaborole at a dose strength and regimen that ha s been demonstrated to be well- tolerated and efficacious based on the completed Phase 3 development program data. Crisaborole ointment, 2% was applied BID in two Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, vehicle- controlled 4 -week studies (AN2728 -AD-301 and AN272 8-AD-302) in subjects with mild to moderate AD aged 2 years and older. The pediatric population comprised approximately 86% of the pooled study population. This study also contains a vehicle arm that has important emollient properties and does not represe nt a true placebo. I t is known that some vehicle excipients have a more pronounced beneficial effect on the skin than previously considered and can improve clinical appearance and skin barrier function. In particular, petrolatum the main excipient and ba se of crisaborole ointment, 2% was selected for its emollient properties and favorable tolerability profile. The use of topical emollients is an essential element of the treatment of AD recommended b y published clinical guidelines. This study also contain s two active comparator therapies, hy drocortisone buty rate cream 0.1% and pimecrolimus cream 1%, that have been approved for the treatment of mild to"

Crisaborole ointment, 2% applied BID was studied in two Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, vehicle- controlled studies (AN2728 -AD-301 and AN2728 -AD-302) , and a Phase 3 open- label long -term safet y stud y (AN2728 -AD-303). Data from the two controlled studies showed no sy stemic safet y concerns in subjects aged 2 years and older. In the open- label study , crisaborole ointment, 2% applied BID, demonstrated that long - term use was well tolerated and no clinicall y important systemic safet y signals were identified in subjects aged 2 y ears and older. The most common drug related adverse events (AEs) from the two controlled studies were application site reactions (5.6% and 3.6% for crisaborole and vehicle groups, respectivel y) and most were cl assified as mild. Of these drug related application site reactions, application site pain (eg, burning or stinging) was the onl y treatment related AE that showed a clinically relevant difference in rates between the treatment groups (4.4% and 1.2% for cri saborole and vehicle groups, respectivel y). Generally , application site pain was noted earl y in the treatment period and was transient in nature, resolving spontaneously . The safet y profile from the open label long term clinical study in which crisaborole was applied intermittently for up to 48 weeks was consistent with that of the two controlled pivotal clinical studies. A review of the post -marketing safet y data, to date, has shown that the t ype and occurrence of adverse event reports are consistent with the known safet y profile of crisaborole. No new safety signals or unusual trends have been identified. Adequate and well -controlled clinical studies of pregnant women have not been performed for crisaborole and there is a limited amount of data from the use of crisaborole in pregnant women. As per protocol, women who are pregnant or intending to become pregnant are excluded from the study and women of child- bearing potential must use a highl y effective method of contraception. Studies in renal or hepatic impaired patient populations have not been conducted. Studies to date did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 years and over to determine whether they respond differentl y from younger subjects. Hypersensitivity , including contact urticaria , has occurred in subjects treated with crisaborole. As per protocol, subjects with a history of angioedema or anaphy laxis to topical products or known sensitivity to an y of the components of the investigational products are excluded."

The most common side effects (these may affect up to 1 in 10 people, or up to 10%) are application site reactions including skin infections, eczema, and redness. Pimecrolimus 1% cream is an approved treatment for mild to moderate AD and has a well-documented and established safet y profile that is clearl y described in the product label. In this study , pimec rolimus is used as a second- line treatment as per label. The most common side effects (these may affect up to 1 in 10 people, or up to 10%) are skin infections and application site reactions (irritation, redness, and itching). In conclusion, the clinical experience obtained to date with crisaborole, support the continued development of crisaborole for the treatment of AD and support the initiation of thisPhase 3b/4 clinical Study C3291037.

STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3b/4, multicenter, randomized, assessor blinded, vehicle and active (TCS and TCI) controlled study of the efficacy, safety and local tolerability of crisaborole ointment,2% in pediatric and adult subjects, ages 2 years and older, with mild to moderate AD involving at least 5% treatable %BSA. Treatment will be clinical assessor-blinded for all treatment arms and double-blinded for crisaborole ointment, 2% and vehicle treatment arms. A total of approximately 600 subjects will be enrolled in the study, of which at least 150 subjects aged 2-6; at least 140 subjects aged 7-11; at least 120 subjects aged 12-17 and up to 90 subjects will be adults. Following the screening period (up to 35 days prior to Baseline/Day 1), eligible subjects will be randomized at the Baseline/Day 1 visit. Randomization will be stratified by eligibility for TCS or TCI treatment as per national approved labels and eligibility provided in Section 4 . Cohort 1 will be for subjects who are eligible for TCS therapy, and Cohort 2 will be for subjects who are not eligible for TCS therapy but eligible for TCI therapy. The investigational product will be applied BID for 28 days to the Treatable BSA identified at Baseline/Day 1. Any new AD on treatment-eligible locations occurring following Baseline/Day 1 should also be treated with the study drug after consultation with the Investigator at the next visit. The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change from baseline in the EASI total score at Day 29.CCI"

Contraception All fertile female subjects who are of childbearing potential as applicable to the study who are, in the opinion of the investigator, sexually active and at risk for pregnancy with their partner(s) must agree to use a highly effective method of contraception consistently and correctly forthe screening period, the duration of the active treatment period and for at least 28days after the last dose of investigational product. The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation wit h the subject, will confirm that the subject has selected an appropriate method of contraception for the individual subject from the permitted list of contraception methods (see below) and will confirm that the subject has been instructed in its consistent and correct use. At time points indicated in the Schedule of Activities , the investigator or his/her designee will inform the subject of the need to use highl y effective contraception consistently and correctly and document the co nversation and the subject’s affirmation in the subject’s chart (subjects needs to affirm their consistent and correct use of at least 1 of the"
36,page_36,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 37selected methods of contraception). In addition, the i nvestigator or his/her designee will instruct the subject to call immediately if the selected contraception method is discontinued or if pregnancy is known or suspected in the subject or the partner. Highl y effective methods of contraception are those that, alone or in combination, result in a failure rate of l ess than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly (ie, perfect use) and include the following: 1.Established use of hormonal methods of contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (eg, oral, inserted, injected, implanted, transdermal) provi ded the subject or male subject’s female partner plans to remain on the same treatment throughout the entire study and has been using that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness. 2.Correctly placed copper -containing intrauterine device (IUD). 3.Male condom or female condom used WITH a spermicide product (ie, foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository ). For countries where spermicide is not available or condom plus spermicide is not accepted as highly effective contraception , this option is not appropriate. 4.Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the post vasectomy ejaculate. 5.Bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral salpingectom y or bilateral tubal occlusive procedure (provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance wi th the device’s label). NOTE: Sexual abstinence, defined as completel y and persistently refraining from all heterosexual intercourse (including during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments) may obviate the need for contraception ON LY if this is the preferred and usual lifesty le of the subject. The Pfizer Medical Monitor can be contacted for further guidance, if necessary . 4.4.2. Other Lifestyle Requirements Routine preventative immunizations are permitted during the stud y; however, it is preferred that immunizations be administered at least 28 days before the start or following the completion of the subject’s participation. Subjects should avoid apply ing an occlusive dressing to the treated areas, not swim, bathe or be bathed or have treat ment areas washed for at least 4 hours after application of investigational product. Use of sunscreen is permitted, but only on areas without AD involvement. Due to the potential to affect AD with ultraviolet light exposure, subjects must also avoid prolon ged exposure to the sun and not use tanning booths, sun lamps or other ultraviolet light sources during the study ."
37,page_37,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 38The subject and/or caregiver s hould avoid wiping the investigational product off the skin and investigational product should not be reapplied to areas that were inadvertently wiped until the next scheduled dose. When apply ing investigational product, the subject and/or caregiver will generall y not be required to wear gloves. However, they must be instructed to wash their hands with mild soap a nd water before and after each application. Subjects with lesions on hands must take care not to wash off investigational product from the hands. Caregivers who are pregnant or women of childbearing potential, who are try ing to become pregnant, should avo id accidental exposure by either avoiding apply ing investigational product or wearing gloves during its application. Care should also be taken when handling the child after investigational product has been applied. 4.5.Sponsor’s Qualified Medical Personnel The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the study is documented in the study contact list located in the supporting study documentation. To facilitate access to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on stu dy-related medical questions or problems, subjects are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and investigational product identifiers, subject study numbers, contact information for the investigator site, and conta ct details for a contact center in the event that the investigator site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the subject’s participation in the study . The contact number can also be used by investigator staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the established communication pathway s between the investigator site and the study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the established communication pathway s between the investigator site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the stud y. The contact numb er is not intended for use b y the subject directly, and if a subject calls that number, he or she will be directed back to the investigator site. 5.STUDY TREATMENTS For the purposes of this study , and per International Council for Harmonisation (I CH) guidel ines, investigational product is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active ingredient or placebo being tested or used as a reference/comparator in a clinical trial, including a product with a marketing authorization when used or assembled (formulated o r packaged) in a way different from the approved form, or when used for an unapproved indication, or when used to gain further information about an approved use (I CH E6 1.33). For this study , investigational products are the following: Crisaborole ointmen t, 2%, also referred to as active;"
38,page_38,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 39Crisaborole vehicle ointment, also referred to as vehicle ; Hydrocortisone but yrate cream ,0.1% (eg. Locoid), also referred to as TCS ; Pimecrolimus cream ,1% ( eg. Elidel ), also referred to as TCI. Crisaborole ointment, 2%, is formulated to contain crisaborole (2% wt/wt), white petrolatum, propy lene gl ycol, mono -and digl ycerides, paraffin wax, buty lated hy droxytoluene, and edetate calcium disodium. Vehicle (no active drug in the formulation) contains white petrolatum, pr opylene gly col, mono -and digl ycerides, paraffin wax, buty lated hy droxy toluene, and edetate calcium disodium. For h ydrocortisone but yrate cream , 0.1% and p imecrolimus cream, 1% the national approved label insert will be provided to each site for content in formation. 5.1.Allocation to Treatment Allocation of subjects to treatment groups will proceed through the use of an interactive response technology (IRT) sy stem (interactive Web -based response [I WR]). The site personnel (stud y coordinator or specified design ee) will be required to enter or select information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and password, the protocol number, and the subject number. The site personnel will then be provided with a treatment assignment, randomization number, and dispensable unit (DU) or container number (s)when investigational product is being supplied via the I RT s ystem. The I RT system will provide a confirmation report containing the subject number, randomization number, and DU or container number (s)assigned. The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. The study -specific I RT reference manual will provide the contact information and further detail s on the use of the IRT sy stem. 5.2.Breaking the Blind In this stud y treatment will be clinical assessor -blinded for all treatment arms and double -blinded for crisaborole ointment, 2% and vehicle treatment arms. Unblinded personnel will be required to manage subject treatment allocation, handle investigational products, review the Dosing Diary and participate in the Baseline/Day 1 investigational product application training. All study treatment s will be masked by over -labeling with a tube label that will be applied over the entire body and crimp of the tube . At the initiation of the study , the investigator site will be instructed on the method for breaking the blind. The methods will be by an electronic or telephone process. Blinding codes should be broken only in exceptional circumstances when knowledge of the actual treatment code is absolu tely essential for further management of the subject. Investigators are encouraged to discuss with a member of the stud y team if they believe"
39,page_39,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 40that unblinding is necessary . When the blinding code is broken, the reason must be fully documented and entered on the case report form (CRF). 5.3. Subject Compliance The s ubject and/or a caregiver will apply investigational product at home; compliance will be captured and completed by the subject/ caregiver using a Dosing D iary and instructions provide d by the site. The subject and /orcaregiver will be instructed to complete the Dosing Diary starting with the first dose applied in the clinic on Day 1, then BID through Day 28 (ie,each time investigational product is applied) for the investigational product doses applied at home. Ifthe subject comes to the clinic in the afternoon, two doses ( 12 4 hours apart) or single dose could be administered on Day 1. Subjects and/or caregivers will be instructed to bring the Dosing Diary and all dispensed investigational product supplies in its original package (used as well as unused) to the clinic at Day s8, 15, 22, and 29. A total of 56 doses are expected to be applied. A subject will be considered compliant with the dosing regimen if they receive at least 45 but no more than 67 investigational product doses (ie, 80 –120%, inclusive, of the expected number of doses) administered in accordance with the protocol. This will be verified b y the dosing records . Subjects and/or caregivers having missed doses of IP will be re -educated on the importance of compliance. 5.4.Investigational Product Supplies 5.4.1. Dosage Form(s) and Packaging Crisaborole ointment, 2% and vehicle ointment will be supplied in 60 gram tubes for topical administration. The tubes will be provided in cartons andlabeled in a blinded fashion . Hydrocortisone but yrate cream ,0.1% will be supplied in either 30 gram or 45 gram tubes for topical administration. The tubes will be masked by a label and provided in cartons. The product will be labeled in a blinded fashion to mask contents. Pimecrolimus cream , 1% will be supplied in either 30 gram or 60 gram tubes for topical administration. The tubes will be masked by a label and provided in cartons. The product will be labeled in a blinded fashion to mask contents. The blinded l abeling for all products will be according to local regulatory requirements. The investigational products above are masked for appearance, and will be placed into identical cartons. Once removed from the product cartons, the investigational products could be discerned from each other based on commercial product tube shape/size and should only be handled b y unblinded site personnel. 5.4.2. Preparation and Dispensing Within this protocol, preparation refers to the investigator site activities performed to make the investigational product read y for administration or dispensing to the subject/caregiver b y qualified staff. Dispensing is defined as the provision of investigational product, concomitant treatments, and accompan ying information by qualified staff member(s ) to a"
40,page_40,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 41healthcare provider, subject, or caregiver in accordance with this protocol. L ocal health authority regulations or investigator site guidelines may use alternative terms for these activities. The investigational product will be dispensed in a blind ed fashion using an I RT s ystem at each visit from Baseline/Day 1 to the Day 22 visit. A n unblinded qualified staff member will dispense the investigational product via unique container numbers on the cartons provided, in quantities appropriate for the stu dy visit schedule and the treatable %BSA. For doses to be administered at home, the subject or caregiver should be instructed to maintain the product in its original package provided throughout the course of dosing and return the product and its original p ackag e(including empt y, partial used and unused tubes) to the site at the next study visit. All previously dispensed investigational product tubes will be retained b y the site. Investigational product tubes will be weighed individually or collectively by the study site before dispensing and after return and the weights will be recorded. The sponsor will use the recorded weights to estimate usage (mg/cm2/day) by each subject. Note that the weight recorded on the investigational product label is a nomina l weight and not an exact weight of the in vestigational product and tube. 5.5.Administration Before the Day 1 initial investigational product application is performed, the designated areas for treatment will be identified at the Baseline/Day 1 Visit and docume nted in the subject’s source document study records (body maps). The subject and /or caregiver will be provided with documentation of the designated treatment areas. Regimen: Investigational product will be applied BID (12 4 hours apart) to all treatable AD involved areas (excluding the scalp) identified at Baseline/Day 1 through Day 28. Wearing gloves, unbli nded personnel will apply athin layer of investigational product to all treatable AD lesions identified at Baseline/Day 1. Subjects and/or caregive rswill be encouraged to observe and participate in the initial investigational product application on Day 1. All subsequent doses, including the second dose on Day 1 (if applicable) , will be applied at home. Those subjects apply ing IP at home and having difficult y reaching treatment -eligible atopic dermatitis areas (eg, back) may be assisted by another person who will need to apply the investigational product to the subject according to the above investigational product application instructions. Subjects and/or caregivers will be instructed to not wipe investigational product off the skin, avoid apply ing an occlusive dressing to the treated areas , and refrain from swimming or bathing/washing the treated areas within 4 hours after application. In the event the scheduled Day 29 (End of Treatment) Visit does not occur on Day 29, eg, due to an unavoidable scheduling conflict, the subject and/or caregiver will be instructed to continue investigational product application BID through the evening before the day that the rescheduled End of Treatment Visit is to occur (see Subject Compliance Section 5.3). Investigational product will continue to be applied to all treatable AD involved areas (excluding scalp) identified at Baseline/Day 1 regardless of whether they become clinicall y"

Investigational product will also be applied to an y new AD on treatment eligible locations occurring following Baseline/Day 1after consultation with the Investigator at the next visit . Therefore, the BSA for Investigational Product at subsequent visits should be equal to or greater than the value at Baseline/Day 1. Subjects and /orcaregivers will be instructed to apply evening (PM) doses approximately 8–16hours after the morning (AM) doses (eg, if an AM dose is completed at 8:00 AM, the PM dose can be applied any time between 4:00 PM and 12:00 AM). Caregivers or partners may also be ones to apply investigational product , especiall y for areas that a su bject cannot reach, even in adults. The first dose is preferred to be administered in the morning on Day 1. If the subject comes to the clinic in the afternoon, two doses (12  4 hours apart) or single dose could be administered on Day 1. 5.6.Investigational Product Storage The investigator or an approved unbli nded representative, eg, pharmacist or other appropriatel y trained personnel, will ensure that all investigational products are stored in a secured area with controlled access under required storage cond itions and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Investigational products should be stored in their original containers and in accordance with the labels. Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD will be superseded b y the storage conditio ns stated on the product label. Site sy stems must be capable of measuring and documenting (for example, via a log), at a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations (as applicable, including frozen, refrigerated, and/or room- temperature products). This should be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study . Even for continuous- monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for excursions should be available. The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum temperature is checked each business day to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last evaluation and to provide the site with the capability to store or view the minimum/maximum temperature for a ll non -working day s upon return to normal operations. The operation of the temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, should be regularl y inspected to ensure they are maintained in working order."
42,page_42,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 43Any excursi ons from the product label storage conditions should be reported to Pfizer upon discovery . The site should actively pursue options for returning the product to the storage conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible. Deviations from the sto rage requirements, including any actions taken, must be doc umented and reported to Pfizer. Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used until Pfizer provides permission to use the investigational product. I t will not be considered a protocol deviation if Pfizer approves the use of the investigational product after the temperature excursion. Use of the investigational product prior to Pfizer approval will be considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site. Receipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routine handling operations where the products are briefl y out of the temperature range described in th e labeling are not considered excursions. Site staff will instruct subjects and/or parent s/legal guardians on the proper storage requirements for take home investigational products. The Investigational Product Manual should be referenced for an y addition al guidance on storage conditions and actions to be taken when conditions are outside the specified range. 5.7.Investigational Product Accountability The investigator site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other disposition of the investigational product supplies. All investigational products will be accounted for using a d rug accountabilit y form/record. Throughout the stud y, detailed investigational product accountability records, including tube weights, will be maintained for each subject by study staff. The subject sand/or caregivers will be asked to bring all dispensed investigational product (including empt y, partial used and unused tubes) and the dosing diary to the clinic at every visit. Detailed drug accountability records, including weekl y tube weights measured in the clinic, will be maintained by unblinded personnel for each subject. The original investigational product accountability log, or equivalent document, must be accuratel y completed, signed by the Investiga tor, and retained at the study site (with a copy supplied to the Sponsor) when the stud y is complete. The accountability log will be an unblinded document until study completion and therefore should onl y be accessed b y unblinded site personnel. 5.7.1. Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused investigational product (eg, at the site). If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the investigator must ensure t hat the materials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy , and any special instructions provided by Pfizer, and all destruction must be adequatel y documented."

If consent is withdrawn for the follow -up period, the procedures for withdrawal of consent will be followed. Withdrawal of consent : Subjects and/or parent/legal guardian/legally acceptable representative who request to discontinue receipt of study treatment will remain in the study and must continue to be followed for protocol specified follow-up procedures. The onl y exception to this is when a subject specifically withdraws c onsent for an y further contact with him or her or persons previously authorized by the subject to provide this information. Subjects should notify the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow- up, whenever possible.

The children’s C -SSRS will be administered for subjects 7- 11 years old and the C -SSRS for subjects  12 years old. T his is investigator completed. 7.6.Safety Assessments 7.6.1. Clinical Laborat ory Evaluations The following safet y laboratory tests will be performed at times defined in the Schedule of Activity section of this protocol. Additional laboratory results may be reported on these samples as a result of the method of anal ysis or the ty pe of analy zer used by the clinical laboratory ; or as derived from calculated values. These additional tests would not require additional collection of blood. Unscheduled clinical labs may be obtained at any time during the study toassess any perceived safety concerns. The clinical laboratory test parameters that will be reviewed for safet y evaluation are presented in Table 7.Hematology , Chemistry and FSH will be done at a central laboratory ."

In the case of a positive urine -hCG test during the treatment period , the subject w ill have study drug interrupted and a serum sample submitted to the central laboratory for -hCG testing. In the case of a positive c onfirm ed pregnancy, the subject will be withdrawn from administration of investigational product and from the study; if the serum -hCG test is negative and investigator judged that the subject is not pregnant , the subject may resume investigational produc t. rClinical laboratory tests will be drawn atthe Screening visit and Baseline/ Day 1, after assessment of vital signs and prior to the first investigational product application and on Day 29. If the screening serum chemistry and hematology tests are performed within 14days prior to Baseline/ Day1, whether the Baseline/ Day 1 serum chemistry and hematology tests are to be performed will be at the medical judgment of the investigator . At the discretion of the investigator or his/her designee , a lidocaine -based topical anesthetic (eg,lidocaine 4%cream) may be used prior to clinical laboratory sample collection to decrease potential discomfort to the subject. However, the skin must be thoroughl y cleansed prior to blood sample collection. This must be reco rded i n the eCRF. The blinded clinical assessor will review all clinical laboratory test results for safet y evaluation upon receipt. After reviewing the laboratory reports and evaluating the results for clinical significance, the blinded clinical assessor must sign and date the laboratory report. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities are defined as abnormal values that have"
71,page_71,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 72clinical manifestations or require medical intervention. Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities noted from the Sc reening Visit will be r ecorded in the medical history . A clinically significant laboratory abnormality detected after the Screening Visit may reflect the development of an AE. Whenever possible, Investigators should report the clinical diagnosis suggested by the laboratory abnormality rather than listing individual abnormal test results as AEs. If no diagnosis has been found to explain the abnormal laboratory result, the clinically significant lab result should be recorded as an AE, reflecting the lack of a diagnosis (see Section 8.2.2 ). 7.6.2. Physical Examination, Height, and Weight Physical examinations, height, and weight will be performed at times specified in the Schedule s of A ctivities section of this protocol. Physical examinations may be conducted by a ph ysician, trained ph ysician's assistant, or nurse practitioner as acceptable according to local regulation. A detailed physical examination will be performed at Screening , Baseline/ Day 1and Day 29 (End of treatment) /Earl y termination visit which will include, but is not limited to the following organ or bod y systems: head, ears, ey es, nose, mouth, skin, heart and lung examinations, ly mph nodes, musculoskeletal, abdome n (liver, spleen), and neurological systems. In addition, an assessment will be made of the condition of all AD involve d skin. For measuring weight, a scale with appropriate range and resolution is used and must be placed on a stable, flat surface. Subje cts must remove shoes, bulky layers of clothing, and jackets so that only light clothing remains. They must also remove the contents of their pockets and remain still during measurement of weight. 7.6.3. Vital Signs Vital sign measurements (temperature, respirat ory rate, pulse rate, and BP) will be performed at Screening, Baseline/Day 1 and Day 29. Vital sign measurements should be performed with the subject in the seated or lyingposition and after the subject has been sitting or lying calmly for a minimum of 5 minutes. The position of recording must be consistent within subject through -out the study . On study day visits when clinical laboratory tests are performed, assessment of vital signs should precede blood draw. 7.7.Pregnancy Testing For female subjects of c hildbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin ( -hCG) , with sensitivity of at least 25mIU/mL, will be performed at screening, prior to dosing with investigational product on Day 1 andat the end -of-treatment (Day 29) visit, to confirm the subject has not become pregnant during the study . A negative pregnancy test result is required before the subject can receive investigational product . Pregnancy tests will also be done whenever 1 menstrual cy cle is missed during the active treatment period (or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected). Pregnancy"
72,page_72,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 73tests may also be repeated if requested b y institutional review boards (I RBs)/ethics committees (ECs) or if required by local regulations or at the discretion of the investigator or his/her designee . A pediatric female subject who has not experienced menarche is not required to perform pregnancy testing. If the pediatric female subject starts menarche during the study , pregnancy testing will be performed at the next vi sit and all visits according to the Schedule of Activities. Urine pregnancy tests must be sensitive to at least 25 mIU/mL and will be conducted at site with the test kit provided by the central laboratory in accordance with instruc tions provided in its package insert. Subjects who have missed a menstrual period or who show an indeterminate or positive result on the urine test may not further progress in the study until pregnancy is ruled out using further diagnostic testing (eg, a negative quantitative serum pregnancy test conducted at a certified laboratory ).In the case of a positive urine -hCG test during the treatment period , the subject will have study drug interrupted and a serum sample submitted to the central laboratory for-hCG testing. In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy , the subject will be withdrawn from administration of investigational product and from the study ; if the serum -hCG test is negative and investigator judge s that the subject is not pregnant , the subject may resume investigational product . 7.8.Rater Qualifications Clinical evaluations of atopic dermatitis will be performed byan experienced and qualified dermatologist (board certified or equivalent) who is treatment blind ed. An experienced and qualified non- dermatologist phy sician or experienced medical professional with experience in the conduct of AD clinical trials who is treatment blind edmay be permitted to perform the clinical evaluations of atopic dermatitis when designated b y the primary si te Investigator and with Sponsor approval. The evaluator must receive and document protocol specific and applicable efficacy assessment scales training prior to performing these evaluations. To assure consistency and reduce variability, the same evaluator must assess all dermatological clinical evaluations for any individual subject throughout the study whenever possible ; a back -up experienced and qualified, protocol- trained evaluator will only be allowed and documented in case of emergency orspecial situations when the designated evaluator is unable to perform the evaluation. Study personnel administering the C -SSRS must have completed the appropriate training and have valid certification . 8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING 8.1.Requirements The table below summarizes t he requirements for recording safet y events on the CRF and for reporting safety events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Report Form to Pfizer Safety . These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; (2)non-serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure."
73,page_73,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 74Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE Report Form to Pfizer Safety Within 24 Hours of Awarene ss SAE All All Non-serious AE All None Exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposureAll (regardless of whether associated with an AE), except occupational exposureExposure during pregn ancy , exposure via breastfeeding, occupational exposure (regardless of whether associated with an AE) All observed or volunteered events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as d escribed in the following paragraphs. Events listed in the table above that require reporting to Pfizer Safet y on the CT SAE Report Form within 24 hours of awareness of the event by the investigator are to be reported regardless of whether the event is det ermined by the investigator to be related to an investigational product under study . In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to Pfizer Safety must be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available event information. This time frame also applies to additional new (follow -up) information on previously forwarded reports. I n the rare situation that the investigator does not become immediately aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the event. For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for cl assification as an SAE (see the Serious Adverse Events section below). In addition, the investigator may be requested b y Pfizer Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion. This information is more de tailed than that recorded on the CRF . In general, this will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causalit y. An y information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided. I n the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety . An y pertinent additional information must be reporte d on the CT SAE Report Form; additional source documents (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory data) are to be sent to Pfizer Safet y ONLY upon request."
74,page_74,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 75As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y non -serious AE that is determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by the sponsor as an SAE. To assist in the determination of case seriousness, further information may be requested from the investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinic al study . 8.1.1. Additional Details On Recording Adverse Events on the CRF All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF. I t should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the same as the AE page of the CRF. When the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. AEs should be recorded using concise medical terminology and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report Form for report ing of SAE information. 8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event Information The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported b y the stud y subject/[parent(s)/legal guardian]. I n addition, each study subject/[parent(s)/l egal guardian/] will be questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a non-leading manner. 8.1.3. Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events (see also the Subject Withdrawal /Early Termination section) Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF. When a subject withdraws from the study because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the Requirements section above. 8.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection period”) for each subject begins from the time the subject provides informed consent, which is obtained before the subject’s participation in the study (ie, before undergoing any study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including a minimum of 28 calendar days after the last administration of the investigational product. For subjects who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure status is determined. 8.1.4.1. Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety All SAEs occurring in a subject during the active collection period are reported to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form."
75,page_75,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 76SAEs occurring in a subject after the active collection period has ended are reported to Pfizer Safety if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all S AEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibility of being related to investigational product must be reported to Pfizer Safety . Follow up by the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. 8.1.4.2. Recording Non -serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF During the active collection period, both non- serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the CRF. Follow -up by the investigator may be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. 8.1.4.3. Causality Assessment The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such an assessment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable. An investigator’s causalit y assessmen t is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided. If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” for reporting purposes, as defined b y the sponsor. If the investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related” to investigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study records. In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source d ocuments and CRF, and report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements. 8.1.4.4. Reporting Requirements Regarding SUSARs AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse r eactions (SUSARs) , will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for SUSARs according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary . An in vestigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific safet y information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the investigator’s brochure and will notify the IRB/EC, i f appropriate according to local requirements."
76,page_76,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 778.2.Definitions 8.2.1. Adverse Events An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment orusage. Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: Abnormal test findings; Clinically significant signs and sy mptoms; Changes in ph ysical examination findings; Hypersensitivity ; Progression/worsening of underl ying disease; Drug abuse; Drug dependen cy. Additionally , AEs may include signs and s ymptoms resulting from: Drug overdose; Drug withdrawal; Drug misuse; Drug interactions; Extravasation; Exposure during pregnancy (EDP); Exposure via breastfeeding; Medication error; Occupational exposure. 8.2.2. Abnor mal Test Findings Abnormal objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when an y of the following conditions are met:"
77,page_77,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 78Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; and/or Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing (outside of an y protocol -specified dose adjustments) or discontinuation from the study , significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy; and/or Test result is considered to be an AE by the investigator or sponsor. Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require recording as an AE. 8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: Results in death; Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death); Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; Results in persi stent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); Results in congenital anomaly /birth defect. Or that is considered to be: An important medical event. Medical and scientific judgment is exe rcised in determining whether an event is an important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threatening and/or result in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 8.2.4. Hospitalization Hospitalization is defined as any initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or equivalent healthcare facility , or any prolongati on of an existing admission. Admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric"
78,page_78,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 79wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a tuberculosis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; however, the event leading to the emergency room visit is assessed for medical importance. Hospitalization does not include the following: Rehabilitation facilities; Hospice facilities; Respite care (eg, caregiver relief); Skilled nursing facilities; Nursing homes; Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same -day/ambulatory procedures). Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating clinical AE is not in itself an SAE. Examples include: Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory abnormality ); Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep); Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination); Protocol -specified admission during a stud y (eg, for a procedure required by the stud y protocol); Optional admission not associated with a pre cipitating clinical AE (eg, for elective cosmetic surgery ); Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE; Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures. These should be noted in the baseline documentation for the entire protocol and/or for the indi vidual subject. Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not be reported as SAEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy should be recorded as treatment of the AE."
79,page_79,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 808.3.Severity Assessment If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of consistency , these intensity grades are defined as follows: MILD Does not interfere with subject's usual function. MODER ATE Interferes to some extent with subject's usual function. SEVERE Interferes significantl y with subject's usual function. Note the distinction between the severit y and the seriousness of an AE. A severe event is not necessarily an SAE. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious unless it met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed above. 8.4.Special Situations 8.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events There are no protocol specified SAEs in this study . All SAEs will be reported to Pfizer Safety by the investigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y database. 8.4.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by elevations in transaminases) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt are termed “adaptors.” In some subjects, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome. These subjects fail to adapt and therefore are ""susceptible"" to progressive and serious liver injury , commonly referred to as drug -induced liver injury (DILI). Subjects who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of normal ( ×ULN) should be monitored more frequently to determine if they are an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.” In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by several days or weeks. The increase in TBili ty picall y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample). In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have decreased. This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI. Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are consider ed potential DILI (assessed per Hy’s law criteria) cases and should alway s be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the subject’s individual baseline values and underl ying conditions. Subjects who present with the"
80,page_80,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 81following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases to definitivel y determine the etiology of the a bnormal laboratory values: Subjects with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR AL T values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value >2 ×ULN with no evidence of hemoly sis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2 ×ULN or not available; For subjects with baseline AST OR ALT OR TBili values above the ULN, the following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline: Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT values >2times the baseline values AND >3 × ULN; or >8 × ULN (whichever is smaller). Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN or if the value reaches >3 ×ULN (whichever is smaller). Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed individually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potenti al Hy’s law case should be reviewed with the sponsor. The subject should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history , and physical assessment. In addition to repeating measurements of AST and AL T and TBili, laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect bilirubin, gamma -glutam yl transferase (GGT), prothrombin tim e (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels. Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology . A detailed history , including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over -the-counter medications) , recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history , sexual history , travel history , history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted. All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria of AST/AL T and TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no other reason for the liver function tests ( LFT)abnormalities has y et been found. Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability"
81,page_81,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 82of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities. A potential DILI (Hy ’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology . 8.4.3. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure Exposure to the investigational product under study during preg nancy or breastfeeding and occupational exposure are reportable to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of investigator awareness. 8.4.3.1. Exposure During Pregnancy For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy (EDP) occurs if: A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and /or being exposed to the investigational product. An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic pro ducts). A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy . If a subject or subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report this information to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplemental form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. In add ition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cy totoxic product by inhalation or spillage) to Pfizer Safety using the EDP supplemental form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to t ermination of pregnancy ). Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and n otify Pfizer Safet y of the outcome as a follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for terminatio n should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural"
82,page_82,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 83integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported). Ifthe outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a live-born bab y, a terminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safet y as SAEs follows: Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion. Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality , as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the investigational product. Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the sponsor. Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify developmental delay s). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that the subject was given the Pregnant Partner R elease of Information Form to provide to his partner. 8.4.3.2. Exposure During Breastfeeding Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of an associated SAE, to Pfizer Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s aware ness, using the CT SAE Report Form. An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experi ences an SAE associated with such a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding. 8.4.3.3. Occupational Exposure An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person (whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the product, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE. An occupational exposure is reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Rep ort Form, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE. Since the information does not pertain to a subject enrolled in the study , the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed CT SAE Report Form is maintained in the inves tigator site file."

Medication errors include : Medication errors involving subject exposure to the investigational product; Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or do not involve the participating subject. Such medication errors occurring to a stud y participant are to be captured on the medication error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page. In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified immediately . Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by an AE, as determined by the investigator, the medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if applicable, an y associated AE(s), serious and n on-serious, are reco rded on an AE page of the CRF. Medication errors should be reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours on a CT SAE Report Form only when associated with an SAE . 9. DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS Detailed methodology for summary and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study is outlined here and further detailed in a statistical anal ysis plan (SAP), which will be maintained by the sponsor. The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. 9.1.Sample Size Determination A total of approximately 600 subjects will be enrolled into this study .Approximately 300subjects who are eli gible to receive TCS therapy (Cohort 1) will be randomized to crisaborole ointment ,2%, the matching vehicle ointment for crisaborole, or TCS with a"
84,page_84,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 85randomization ratio of 1:1:2. Approximately 300 subjects who are ineligible to receive TCS therap y and eli gible to receive TCI therap y (Cohort 2) will be randomized to crisaborole ointment ,2%, the matching vehicle ointment for crisaborole, or pimecrolimus cream 1%with randomization ratio 1:1:2. A sample size of 150 subjects in the crisaborole group combined from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 and 150 subjects in vehicle group combined from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will provide 86% power to detect a 12% difference of EASI percent reduction from baseline atDay 29 between crisaborole and vehicle at the 0.05 (2 -sided) signi ficance level, assuming the common standard deviation of EASI percent reduction from baseline at Day 29 is 34% . EASI was not collected in previous crisaborole studies. The 12% treatment effect in EASI percent improvement was converted from the ISGA respon se in the Phase 3 studies using a linear regression equation that evaluate dthe relationship between ISGA response rate and EASI percentage improvement from historical trial data of other topical products. From the crisaborole P hase 3 pooled data, the ISG A response rate is 32.1 % for crisaborole ointment, 2%, and 21.8% for vehicle. The converted EASI percent improvement is 38.9% and 26.8% respectively . The difference of EASI percent improvement between crisaborole ointment, 2% and vehicle is approximatel y 12%. With sample size of 75 subjects in the crisaborole group and 150 subjects in the TCS or TCI group s, the half width of the 95% confidence interval for the difference of EASI percent reduction from baseline at Day 29 between crisaborole and active com parator is 9.4%. The sample size within each Cohort will also provide sufficient precision to enable contextualization of the efficacy of crisaborole in treating subjects with mild to moderate AD relative to each active comparator. 9.2.Efficacy Analysis 9.2.1. Analy sis Sets The primary anal ysis population for efficacy data will be the Full Anal ysis Set (FAS) defined as all randomized subjects receiving at least one dose of investigational product . The primary efficacy endpoint will also be analy zed for the Per -Protocol Analy sis Set (PPAS) defined as a subset of FAS who had no protocol violations affecting the efficacy endpoints. The subjects excluded from the PPAS will be determined and do cumented before the study is unblinded. For all analy ses, baseline value will be based on observations collected pre- dose. For t he comparison of crisaborole versus vehicle, subjects from both Cohort 1 and C ohort 2 are included inthe anal ysis, and effect of Cohort will be adjusted. For the comparison of crisaborole v ersus TCS, only subject sfrom Cohort 1 are included in the analy sis. For the comparison of crisaborole versus TCI, onl y subject sfrom Cohort 2 are included in the analysis. 9.2.2. Analysis of the Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint, EASI % change from baseline, will be anal yzed using a mixed- effect repeated measures model that includes the fixed effects of treatment, visit as class variable,"
85,page_85,"Crisaborole (PF-06930164) C3291037 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 86treatment by visit interaction. Within-subject variability will be accounted for using a random effect with the first order autoregressive (AR(1)) covariance matrix. For the comparison of crisaborole versus vehicle, the model will also include factor of Cohort. 9.2.3. Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints Binary endpoints such as ISGA success (defined as an ISGA score of Clear ([0]) or Almost Clear ([1]) with at least a 2 grade improvement from baseline), ISGA score of clear ([0]) or almost clear ([1]), improvement in Peak Pruritus NRS for subjects > 12 years and Observer Reported Itch Severity Scale - for subjects <6 years (defined as achieving ≥2 points reduction in NRS from baseline), improvement in Peak Pruritus NRS for subjects > 12 years and Observer Reported Itch Severity Scale - for subjects <6 years (defined as achieving ≥3 points reduction in NRS from baseline), and achievement of EASI75 at each time point will be analyzed using the CMH test. The comparison of crisaborole versus vehicle will be stratified by Cohort. The evaluation of efficacy of crisaborole versus active comparator (TCS, TCI) will be performed within each Cohort. Continuous endpoints such as change from baseline in Peak Pruritus NRS for subjects > 12 years/Patient Reported Itch Severity Scale - for subjects age 6-11 years/Observer Reported Itch Severity Scale - for subjects <6 years, % BSA, DLQI, CDLQI, and DFI will be analyzed using the same method as proposed in Section 9.2.2 . Baseline value will be used as an additional covariate when modeling the change from baseline. For peak pruritus NRS for subjects > 12 years, Patient Reported Itch Severity Scale - for subjects age 6-11 years, and Observer Reported Itch Severity Scale - for subjects <6 years,weekly average score will be used in the analyses of binary endpoint improvement in peak pruritus/itch and continuous endpoint change from baseline in peak pruritus/itch. There will be no pooling of data from the pruritus/itch scales from different age groups. Data from each instrument will be analyzed separately. Time to event endpoints such as time to EASI75 and time to improvement in peak pruritus/itch will be analyzed by log rank test and duration of time to event will be estimated by the product limit method. A Kaplan-Meier plot will be provided. Log rank test will be stratified by cohort for comparison of crisaborole versus vehicle. The evaluation of efficacyof crisaborole versus active treatment will be performed within each cohort. For Peak Pruritus NRS for subjects > 12 years, Patient Reported Itch Severity Scale - for subjects age 6-11 years, and Observer Reported Itch Severity Scale - for subjects <6 years, daily peak pruritus/itch assessment value will be used for the analysis of time to improvement in peak pruritus/itch. All secondary endpoints will be evaluated at the 5% level of significance, without adjustments for multiple comparisons. CCI"

All subjects who receive investigational product (safety population) will be included in the safet y analyses.Safety data will be descriptivel y summarized, and will be presented in tabul ar and/or graphical format. No imputation will be made for missing safety data. The following safet y data will be summarized: AEs, including SAEs, local tolerability AEs/SAEs and discontinuations ; Clinically significant changes in vital signs; Clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory parameters. 9.4. Interim Analysis No formal interim anal ysis will be conducted for this study . 9.5.Data Monitoring Committee This study will use an external data monitoring committee (E- DMC). The E- DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safet y of subjects in the study according to the charter. The recommendations made b y the E -DMC to alter the conduct of the study will be forwarded to Pfizer for a final decision. Pfizer will forward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate analy ses of endpoint events and of safet y data that are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate. 10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during study conduct to ensure that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed. The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRFs are accurate. The investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/ auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. This verification may also occur after study completion. During stud y conduct and/or after stud y completion, the investigator sit e may be subject to review b y the IRB/EC, and/or to quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities. The investigator(s) will notify Pfizer or its ag ents immediately of any regulatory inspection notification in relation to the study . Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with Pfizer or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its agent, whenever fe asible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve an y discrepancies that are identified between the stud y data and the subject's medical records. The investigator will promptl y provide copies of the inspection findings to Pfizer or its agent. Before response submission to the regulatory"

It is important that the investigator(s) and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 11.DATA HANDLING AND RE CORD KEEPING 11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record As use d in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study . A CRF is required and should be completed for each included subject. Th e completed original CRFs are the sole propert y of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Pfizer. The investigator shall ensure that the CRFs/DCTs are secure ly stored at the study site in encrypted electronic and/or paper form and w ill be password protec ted or secured in a locked room to prevent access by unauthorized third parties. The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safet y, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source documents) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required. The CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to attest that the data contained on the CRFs are true. An y corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry . In most cases, the source documents are the hospital or the ph ysician subject chart. In these cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document. In these cases, a document should be available at the investigator site and at Pfizer that clearl y identifies those data that will be recorded on the CRF, an d for which the CRF will stand as the source document. 11.2. Record Retention To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent[/assent] documents, copies of all CRFs, safet y reporting forms, source documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documen tation of relevant correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports). The records should be retained by the investigator according to the ICH guidelines, according to local regulations, or as specified in the clinical study agreeme nt (CSA), whichever is longer."
88,page_88,"Crisa borole (PF -06930164) C32910 37 Final Protocol Amendment 3, 12 Aug 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 89The investigator must ensure that the records continue to be stored securel y for so long as they are retained. If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the required period (eg , retirement, relocation), Pfizer should be prospectivel y notified. The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another investigator, another institution, or an independent third party arranged by Pfizer. Investigator records must be kept for a minimum of 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations. The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of an y records, even if retention requirements have been met."

All other identifiable data transferred to Pfizer or other authorized parties will be identified by this single, subject- specific code. The investigator site will maintain a confidential list of subjects who participated i n the study , linking each subject’s numerical code to his or her actual identity . In case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of confidentiality and protection of subjects’ personal data consistent with the Clinical Study Agreement and a pplicable privacy laws. The informed consent [/assent] documents and any subject recruitment materials must be in compliance with ICH GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements, including applicable privacy laws. The informed consent [/asse nt] documents used during the informed consent process and any subject recruitment materials must be reviewed and approved b y Pfizer, approved b y the IRB/EC before use, and available for inspection. The investigator must ensure that each study subject, or parent(s) or legal guardian if a minor is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study , the sharing of data relating to the study and possible risks associated with participation, including the risks associated with the processing of the subject’s personal data. The investigator further must ensure that each study subject, or his or her legall y acceptable representative, or parent(s) or legal guardian if a minor, is fully informed about his or her right to access and correct his or her per sonal data and to withdraw consent for the processing of his or her personal data. Whenever consent is obtained from a subject’s [parent(s) or legal guardian], the subject’s assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the subject has the capacity to provide assent, as determined by the IRB/EC. If the investigator determines that a subject’s decisional capacity is so limited he/she cannot reasonabl y be consulted, then, as permitted by the IRB/EC and consistent with local regulatory and legal requirements, the subject’s assent may be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not obtained. If the stud y subject does not provide his or her own consent, the source documents must record wh y the subject did not provide consent (eg, minor), how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the subject’s legall y acceptable representative, the consent signer’s relationship to the study subject (eg, parent), and that the subject’s assent was obtained or waived . If assent is obtained verball y, it must be documented in the source documents. If the stud y includes minor subjects who reach the age of majorit y during the study, as recognized under local law, they must reconsent as adults to remain in the study . If the enrollment of emancipated minors is permitted by the study age criteria, the I RB/EC, and local law, they must provide documentation of legal status to give consent without the permission of a parent or legal guardian."

Introduction Skin atrophy , characterized by whole skin thinning and damage to the skin barrier, is a common problem in the treatment of AD with TCS. Often, effective treatment with TCS must be limited because of the risk of skin atrophy.1 To further explore the benefit/risk of crisaborole ointment, 2%, this sub -study aims to evaluate differences in atrophic skin changes across stud y treatment groups in Cohort 1. Optical coherence tomograph y (OCT) is a non -invasive imaging modalit y concept ually similar to ultrasound but uses ne ar-infrared radiation rather than sound. I t has a 2- 10 micron depth resolution compared with 100- 1,000 micron ty pical for clinical US; and 1 -2 mm imaging depth vs. 10-100 mm for clinical US. I t is thus ideal for imaging the surface lay ers of accessible t issues such as the skin.2 OCT imaging will be obtained using the VivoSight OCT scanner, b y Michelson Diagnostics, Ltd. in this sub -study to evaluate atrophic changes in epidermal thickness during and after treat ment with study investigational product in Cohort 1. This sub- study also provides an opportunity to explore differences in Transepidermal Water Loss (TEWL) and cutaneous inflammatory and barrier biomarkers associated with AD within the stratum corneum (SC ) across treatment groups in Cohort 1. The Aquaflux device is an evaporimeter that measures water exchange through human skin using the condenser -chamber method. The condenser -chamber method uses a humidity gradient to determine the amount of water diffu sing through the SC3. This device will be used in this sub- study to evaluate TEWL during and after treatment at select sub -study centers. Tape -strips are a minimally invasive method that captures cutaneous infl ammatory and barrier biomarkers within the SC, circumventing the need for skin biopsies, especiall y in the pediatric population. Studies have used proteomic immune assay s and messenger ribonucleic acid analyses to evaluate SC biomarkers in tape -strips fro m AD lesional and non -lesional skin from patients with AD. Expression of AD- associated biomarkers in AD tape -stripped skin have been significantly correlated with disease severit y (EASI /pruritus) and the functional barrier measure TEWL . Tape -strips will be used in this sub- study to evaluate SC biomarkers from AD lesional and non- lesional skin. 2.

The secondary objectives of this sub- study are to evaluate the differences in atrophic change in epidermal thickn ess, skin biomarkers of AD, and TEWL during the course of treatment and following treatment with crisaborole ointment, 2% or crisaborole vehicle ointment, or hydrocortisone but yrate 0.1% cream applied BID for 28 day s. This sub- study is expected to provi de OCT, TEWL, and skin biomarker evidence of the effects of crisaborole ointment and vehicle ointment compared to TCS. Primary Sub-Study Endpoint: Change in epidermal thickness from Baseline/Day 1 to Day 29 Secondary Sub-Study Endpoints: Change in epiderm al thickness from Baseline/Day 1 to all sub- study time points except Day 29 (Days 8, 15, 22, and 60) Intrasubject difference of change in epidermal thickness between the non -lesional target skin site and the OCT AD lesional target skin site from baseline t o Day s 8, 15, 22, 29 and 60 Percentage change from Baseline/Day 1 in TEWL at Day s 8, 15, 22, 29 and 60 Change from Baseline/Day 1 in skin biomarkers of AD at Day 15 and Day 29 3. Sub -Study Design This sub- study will be conducted in selected centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and in Germany. This sub -study will include approximately 60 subjects from Cohort 1 that are enrolled in the main study (C3291037) from the selected study centers. Subjects may only enroll in the sub -study during the screening phase or at the baseline visit of the main study prior to any sub-study evaluations or procedure . Subjects that do not qualify for the main study may not participate in the sub -study . Based on the randomization schema from the main study , it is expected that the sample size for this sub- study will include approximately 15 subjects in the crisaborole ointment, 2% arm, 15 subjects in the crisaborole vehicle ointment arm, and 30 subjects in the hy drocortisone buty rate 0.1% cream arm. Subjects will follow the main study assessments and visits as per the schedule of activities for the main study but will also follow additional procedures as described in this appendix. Subjects that are in the main study (C3291037) that are not enrolled in the sub -study will not participate in sub -study procedures or evaluations. The telephone call at Day 60 in the main stud y is replaced with an in -clinic visit for sub- study participants."

Data Analysis/Statistical Methods Approximately 60 subjects (15, 15, 30 in vehicle, crisaborole, hy drocortisone groups respectivel y) will participate this sub- study from Cohort 1. This sub -study is a pilot and there is no formal h ypothesis testing. The sample size is not based on a power calculation and an e stimation approach will be used for data analy sis and interpretation. The anal ysis of change from baseline to Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29, and Day 60 in epidermal skin thickness, will be anal yzed using mixed model repeated measure (MMRM) with treatment, visit, treatment by visit interaction as factors and baseline value as a covariate, separatel y for OCT AD lesional target skin site and non -lesional target skin site. Within -subject variability will be accounted for using a random e ffect with the first order autoregressive (AR(1)) covariance matrix. The same models as above will be used for percentage change from baseline in TEWL at Baseline/ Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29 and Day 60. No baseline value will be included as a cov ariate in the model. Intra -subject difference of change from baseline to Day 8, Day 15, Day 22, Day 29, and Day 60 in epidermal skin thickness between OCT AD lesional target skin site and non -lesional target skin site will be analy zed using MMRM model with visit as a factor for each treatment group . For the tape -strip biomarkers, Log 2-scale quantitative reverse transcription poly merase chain reaction expression data will be modeled by a linear mixed effect model with visit, treatment, visit by treatment int eraction as fixed effects and a random effect for each subject. Means of each group will be estimated using least squares means and comparisons of interest will be tested using contrast. This sub- study will be reported independentl y from the main Clinical Study Report. References 1.Chittock J, Brown, K, Cork MJ, Danby SG.
