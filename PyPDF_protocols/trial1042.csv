(Alexion) 28 Sep 2020 Page 7 of 123 Alexion Confidential Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Endpoints: • Pharmacokinetic/PD parameters including maximum plasma drug concentration (C max), terminal half-life (t ½), trough (C trough), clearance, free complement protein 5 (C5), and in vitro hemolytic assay; assessed at Baseline and various time points including 24 hours (Day 2), Week 12, and Week 26 during treatment Study Design and Methodology: This is an open -label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, and PD of intravenous eculizumab in pediatric patients aged 6 to < 18 years with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) -antibody (Ab) positive refractory gMG. There will be 4 periods in this study: Screening Period (2 to 4 weeks), Primary Evaluation Treatment Period (26 weeks), Extension Period (up to an additional 208 weeks), and Follow -up Period (8 weeks). All patients who complete Week 26 of Study ECU -MG-303 will continue receiving ecu lizumab in the Extension Period of this study for up to an additional 208 weeks. The 8- week Follow -up Period is required following the last dose of study drug for all patients upon withdrawal or discontinuation from the study or upon completion of the study when the patient is not continuing to receive eculizumab treatment. Patients may continue use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChI), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and supportive immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs) during the study where applicable under certain restrictions. Screening Period (2 to 4 weeks): Patients will be screened for study eligibility only after obtaining the informed assent of the patient and informed permission of the parent or other legal guardian. To reduce the risk of me ningococcal infection, all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcal infections within the 3 years prior to, or at the time of, initiating study drug. Patients who initiate study drug treatment less than 2 weeks after receiving a meningococcal vaccine must receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Patients must remain within the current national vaccination guidelines or local practice for vaccination use with complement- inhibitors . In addition to m eningococcal vaccination, patients must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae ) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae ), and strictly adhere to the national vaccination recommendations for each age group. The site must notify the Sponsor if any patient experiences signs and symptoms of MG worsening that require rescue or foreseeable imminent change to the background medication, during the Screening Period. Patients whose MG is unstable (as determined by the Investigator) during the Screening Period may be rescreened based on discussion and agreement between the Investigator and the Alexion Medical Monitor. Primary Evaluation Treatment Period (26 weeks): All patients will receive eculizumab by intravenous (IV) infusion during the open -label Primary Evaluation Treatment Period. Dosing will be initiated with a weekly weight- based induction regimen and, thereafter, will be eve ry 2 weeks. Extension Period (up to 208 weeks): After completing the 26 -week Primary Evaluation Treatment Period, patients will continue receiving eculizumab in the Extension Period of this study for up to an additional 208 weeks. Follow -up Period: • Safet y Follow -up (8 weeks) Patients who do not enter the Extension Period from the Primary Evaluation Treatment Period, who withdraw from the study at any time, or who do not continue to receive eculizumab treatment upon study completion will be followed for at least 8 weeks from their last dose of eculizumab. Patients who complete the study and transition to uninterrupted treatment with commercially available eculizumab will not be required to complete an 8-week follow -up visit."

(Alexion) 28 Sep 2020 Page 8 of 123 Alexion Confidential • Post-Treatment Follow -up (up to 1 year) The Sponsor may seek to collect follow -up information concerning MG status in patients post -treatment for up to 1 year from the end -of-study (EOS)/early termination (ET) visit. Clinical Deterioration and Rescue Therapies Allowed rescue therapy for clinical deterioration includes but is not limited to high -dose corticosteroids, plasma exchange (PE), or IVIg and is at the discretion of the treating physician. Number of Patients (Planned): At Least 12 The study will enroll at least 12 eligible refractory pediatric gMG patients 12 to < 18 years of age to receive open -label eculizumab infusion in order to obtain at least 10 evaluable patients aged 12 to < 18 years for the primary endpoint taking into account potential dropouts . Additional patients between the ages of 6 and 12 may be enrolled, but will not be included in the primary analysis. After 6 patients complete their Week 26 assessments, if the observed standard deviation in change in QMG is 8 or higher, the final sample size will be re -estimated to be at least 14 instead of 12 to preserve adequate power for testing the primary endpoint. The number of eligible refractory pediatric gMG patients aged 12 to < 18 entering on maintenance IVIg treatment in this study will be ca pped at 6 patients . These patients must have been on maintenance IVIg for at least 12 months and on a stable dose ≥ 3 months prior to Screening, with frequency and dose expected to remain stable during Screening and for 12 weeks following the first dose of study drug. Efforts will be made to enroll at least 1 patient in each geographic region (North America, EU, and APAC). There is no cap on patients 6 to < 12 years of age.

Note s: The timing of supplemental eculizumab dosing varies by IVIg frequency and is provided below: • If a patient continues to receive IVIg treatment at a dose cycle interval equal to or more frequent than every 4 weeks during eculizumab treatment, a supplement al dose will be administered at the same time that each scheduled dose of eculizumab is administered. • If a patient receives IVIg treatment at a dose cycle interval less frequent than every 4 weeks during eculizumab treatment, a supplemental dose will be ad ministered following the last dose of the IVIg infusion cycle at the next scheduled eculizumab dose. • If a patient receives IVIg treatment within 4 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of eculizumab, a supplemental dose of eculizumab will be administere d at the same time that the first dose of eculizumab is administered (ie, the total dose is the supplemental dose plus the first scheduled dose). When IVIg is administered as acute rescue therapy for clinical deterioration, no supplemental dose of eculizumab should be administered. However, if a patient receives more than 1 dose cycle of IVIg as rescue therapy within a 12- week period, supplemental eculizumab should be administered after the last dose of the second IVIg cycle and at the end of each s ubsequent IVIg dose cycle within the 12 -week period in accordance with Table 2. For patients who undergo PE, plasmapheresis (PP), or receive fresh frozen plasma (FFP), supplemental eculizumab dosing should be administered as shown in Table 3 .

INTRODUCTION Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare, chronic, autoimmune disease of neuromuscular transmission that manifests clinically in both children and adults as fluctuating weakness in voluntary muscles that is exacerbated during periods of activity and improves after periods of rest (Barnett, 2014; Sieb, 2014). The pathological hallmark of both juvenile and adult forms of MG is production of antibodies (Abs) against the components of the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), predominantly the acetylcholine rece ptor (AChR). Although adults and juveniles with MG share aspects of presentation and pathophysiology, there are differences in epidemiology and prognosis. Additionally, the ongoing development of children and adolescents complicate therapeutic decision mak ing in young patients with MG. 2.1. Epidemiology Myasthenia gravis in children and adolescents is uncommon and comprises approximately 10% to 20% of all MG cases ( Snead, 1980; Szorbor, 1988-1989). The annual incidence of MG in children and adolescents has been reported as approximately 1.1 per million in North America and 1 to 5 per million in Europe ( Phillips, 1992; Andrews, 2004; McGrogan, 2010; Della Marina, 2014), with incidence and prevalence varying geographically. Ten percent of patients with MG have disease limited to ocular muscles, while the remaining 90% have generalized MG (gMG), with muscle weakness involving neck, head, spine, bulbar, respiratory, or limb muscles. Clinically, gMG in children and adolescents presents as fluctuating and fatigable skeletal muscle weakness, which improves with rest, similar to manifestations of the disease in adults. Clinical features may include predominantly ocular symptoms with ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and/or diplopia. Bulbar symptoms of dysphagia and/or dysphonia may be present, as well as generalized symptoms of exercise intolerance and weakness. As with adults, respiratory muscle weakness may be a feature of MG in children and adolescents and may lead to respiratory distress or even respiratory failure, particularly if left untreated. In children and adolescents with MG, prepubertal patients tend to be more clinically distinct compared to adults with MG, as compared with the pubertal/postpubertal group who share more features with adult- onset MG. 2.2. Unmet Medical Need While there is no cure for MG, there are a variety of therapies that reduce muscle weakness and improve neuromuscular function. Currently available treatments for MG aim to modulate neuromuscular transmission, inhibit the production or effects of pathogenic antibodies, or inhibit inflammatory cytokines ( Kim, 2011). There is currently no specific treatment that targets the underlying pathophysiology of NMJ injury specifically: anti- AChR Ab -AChR interactions resulting in complement activation via the classical pathway and inflammation, with the resultant destruction of the NMJ. With current standard of care, which combines cholinesterase inhibitors, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs; most commonly azathioprine [AZA], cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil [MMF]), the majority of MG patients have their disease reasonably well controlled. For the cohort of refractory patients who do not respond adequately to ISTs or cannot tolerate ISTs and those who require repeated treatments with plasma exchange (PE) and/or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) to ma intain clinical stability (Conti-Fine, 2006), there is a medical need for alternative treatment strategies targeting different"
24,page_24,"Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) 28 Sep 2020 Page 25 of 123 Alexion Confidential pathophysiological aspects of the disease. There are currently no approved therapies specific for the treatment of refractory gMG in pediatric patients. Since complement activation plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of MG ( Vincent, 2002; Conti -Fine, 2006), eculizumab, a terminal complement inhibitor, may benefit patients who continue to have generalized weakness and bulbar signs and symptoms despite current standard of care. 2.3. Eculizumab Clinical Program in Refractory Generalized Myasthenia Gravis Alexion has completed 2 clinical studies in adults with refractory gMG, with a Phase 3 extension study currently ongoing. The totality of the eculizumab clinical data from the pivotal Study ECU -MG-301 and the consistency of the eculizumab treatment effect observed over a multitude of independent but complementary MG- specific outcome measures have established substantial evidence of effectiveness of eculizumab in the treatment of adults with refractory gMG. The safety profile of eculizumab observed in adult refract ory gMG patients was consistent with the well -established safety profile of the drug with over 10 years of clinical and postmarketing use. The data observed in the ongoing Study ECU- MG-302 support the long- term safety and maintenance of clinical response o f eculizumab in adults with refractory gMG. Based on the data from these 3 studies, eculizumab was approved for AChR Ab -positive adults with refractory gMG in the EU (14 August 2017), gMG in the US (23 October 2017), and gMG with symptoms that are difficu lt to control with high-dose IVIg therapy or PE in Japan (25 December 2017). Refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for further information on the safety and efficacy data of eculizumab. 2.4. Eculizumab Dose in Pediatric Refractory gMG Patients The s afety and efficacy of the 900 mg/1200 mg dose regimen was previously established in adults with refractory gMG in Study ECU- MG-301. The categorical dose regimen selected for this pediatric study (Study ECU- MG-303) is based on the body weight of the pediatr ic patient, thus allowing for the accommodation of weight changes during the development and maturation of the patient. For pediatric gMG patients on stable, maintenance IVIg treatment, a series of supplemental doses of eculizumab must be administered. If a patient undergoes plasmapheresis (PP)/PE/fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for clinical deterioration during the study, a supplemental dose of study drug must be administered. The proposed pediatric dose regimen is supported by PK/PD modeling and simulation using data from the MG adult studies, and is identical to that approved for pediatric patients with aHUS, except for the supplemental dose with IVIg administration. 2.5. Rationale for Eculizumab Refractory gMG Pediatric Study The pathophysiology of MG involves auto- Ab-driven uncontrolled terminal complement activation with membrane attack complex dependent lysis and activation, which causes inflammation at the NMJ, AChR loss, and failure of neuromuscular transmission. Eculizumab binds specifically to the human terminal complement component 5 (C5), inhibiting C5 enzymatic"
25,page_25,"Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) 28 Sep 2020 Page 26 of 123 Alexion Confidential cleavage and thereby preventing terminal complement activation. The mechanism of action of eculizumab as a potent and selective terminal complement inhibitor supports its use in the management of refractory gMG mediated by complement-activating Abs directed against the NMJ in both adults and children/adolescents. The favorable benefit- risk for eculizumab in the treatment of adult patients with refractory gMG that was established in the adult clinical program provides the basis for studying eculizumab in the pediatric patient population. The clinical development program in adults with refractory gMG has informed the methodology of the study design and investigational plan for this first clinical study in pediatric refractory gMG patients. 2.6. Benefit and Risk Assessment 2.6.1. Potential Benefits Given that MG is a chronic disease, pediatric patients with refractory gMG are at risk of substantial morbidity and mortality, including profound weakness, slurred speech, dysarthria, choking, the inability to swallow hard and/or soft foods, disorienting vision, shortness of breath (both with activity and at rest), significant upper and lower extremity weakness, substantially impaired mobility, marked reductions in ability to perform activities of daily living, extreme fatigue, and episodes of pulmonary failure requiring mechanical ventilation, all of which can have a dramatic impact on quality of life. As there is currently no approved therapy for refractory gMG in the pediatric population, the benefit of sustained terminal complement inhibition and the consistency of the eculizumab treatment effect observed in the adult population support the potential clinical benefit of eculizumab in pediatric refractory gMG patients. 2.6.2. Identified and Potential Risks 2.6.2.1. Meningococcal Infection and Other Encapsulated Bacterial Infections Eculizumab blocks terminal complement; therefore , patients may have increased susceptibility to encapsulated bacterial infections, in particular Neisseria meni ngitidis (N meningitidis ). Specific risk mitigation measures in place are described in Section 6.3.4. 2.6.2.2. Immunogenicity As with any humanized monoclonal Ab, administration of eculizumab may be associated with the development of anti-drug antibodies. Monitoring of immunogenicity is planned, as described in Section 4.2 and Section 9.5."

Overall Design Study ECU- MG-303 is an open- label, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, and PD of eculizumab for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 6 to < 18 years with AChR- Ab positive refractory gMG. At least 12 eligible patients aged 12 to < 18 years are planned to be enrolled in the study and receive eculizumab infusion to obtain at least 10 evaluable patients aged 12 to < 18 years for the primary endpoint taking into account potential dropouts. There will be 4 periods in this study: • Screening Period (2- 4 weeks) • Primary Evaluation Treatment Period (26 weeks) • Extension Period (up to an additional 208 weeks) • Follow-up Period (8 weeks) Patients may continue to receive AChI, IVIg, and ISTs during the study where applicable under certain restrictions. For patients who enter the study receiving any background therapy, the dose and frequency may not be changed during the Primary Evaluation Treatment Period be fore Week 12, unless deemed necessary per the Investigator based on clinical safety evaluation and Sponsor approval is obtained. Dose change with background medication is permitted after Week 12 at the Investigator’s discretion and with Sponsor notification. During the Extension Period, changes in background medications will be permitted at the Investigator’s discretion and with Sponsor notification. If a patient withdraws from the study or discontinues eculizumab treatment at any time, the patient will be required to complete an Early Termination (ET) visit at the time of withdrawal and a Follow-up visit 8 weeks following the last dose of study drug. The overall study duration for an individual patient can be up to 246 weeks (approximately 4.7 years) from the Screening Period through the Follow-up Period. This pediatric study is designed to assess the efficacy and safety of eculizumab in AChR -Ab positive refractory pediatric gMG patients, similar to what has been demonstrated in patients aged ≥ 18 years in Study ECU- MG-301 (a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study). The similar pathogenic autoantibody profile (AChR-Ab), pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and treatment responses in AChR-Ab positive patients aged ≥ 18 years and pediatric patients, combined with the well -understood mechanism of action of eculizumab in inhibiting terminal complement, predict a similar efficacy profile of eculizumab in patients aged ≥ 18 years and pediatric patients with refractory gMG. Given the demonstration of the efficacy and safety of eculizumab in patients aged ≥ 18 years , randomizing pediatric patients to a placebo treatment arm may not be ethically acceptable, so a single arm open -label design was chosen. This pediatric study is similar to the study conducted in patients aged ≥ 18 years (Study ECU- MG-301) in permitting background IST use. All patients may continue to receive ISTs during the study. Given the global nature of the study (multicenter) and experience from the study in patients aged ≥ 18 years, it is anticipated that different ISTs will be used based on local medical practice and local IST availability; thus, the use of ISTs will not be standardized in this study. In contrast to the study in patients aged ≥ 18 years , the number of eligible refra ctory"
28,page_28,"Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) 28 Sep 2020 Page 29 of 123 Alexion Confidential pediatric gMG patients aged 12 to < 18 years entering on maintenance IVIg therapy will be capped at 6 patients . These patients must have been on maintenance IVIg for at least 12 months and on a stable dose ≥ 3 months prior to Screening, with frequency and dose expected to remain stable during Screening and for 12 weeks following the first dose of study drug. E fforts will be made to enroll at least 1 patient in each geographic region (North America, EU, and APAC). There will be no limit on the number o f patients aged 6 to < 12 years who may enter the study on maintenance IVIg. This change was made based on the higher prevalence of maintenance IVIg use in children. 4.1.1. Screening Period (2 to 4 weeks) Patients will be screened for study eligibility only after obtaining the informed consent of the parent or other legal guardian, and the patient’s informed assent, when applicable. Assessment will include confirmation of a refractory gMG diagnosis per protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria, QMG total score, history of previous MG treatments and therapies, history of MG exacerbation or crisis and the treatment for each exacerbation/crisis, and a comprehensive review of medical history, including vaccination history, as well as any non- MG comorbid condit ions. When an eligible patient meets all inclusion criteria, but none of the exclusion criteria, the Principal Investigator must notify the Sponsor to obtain Medical Monitor approval prior to enrolling the patient. To reduce the risk of meningococcal infec tion, all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcal infections within the 3 years prior to, or at the time of, initiating study drug. Patients who initiate study drug treatment less than 2 weeks after receiving a meningococcal vaccine must receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Patients must be vaccinated or revaccinated according to current national vaccination guidelines or local practice for vaccination use with complement-inhibitors (eg, eculizumab) . In addition to meningococcal vaccination, patients must be vaccinated against Haemophilus influenzae (H influenzae ) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (S pneumoniae ), if not already vaccinated, and strictly adhere to the national vaccination recommendat ions for each age group. The site must notify the Sponsor if any patient experiences signs and symptoms of MG worsening that require rescue or foreseeable imminent change to the background medication during the Screening Period. Following discussion with the Sponsor, a decision will be made about whether the patient may be enrolled in the study or should be withdrawn. Patients whose MG is unstable (as determined by the Investigator) during the Screening Period may be rescreened at a later date based on discussion and agreement between the Investigator and the Alexion Medical Monitor. 4.1.2. Primary Evaluation Treatment Period (26 weeks) All patients will receive eculizumab by IV infusion during the open- label Primary Evaluation Treatment Period. Dosing will be in itiated with a weekly weight -based induction regimen and, thereafter, will be every 2 weeks. Weight may change for an individual patient during the study, and dose regimen will be based on the current visit’s recorded body weight. If site/institution policies prohibit study drug to be prepared day- of visit, the weight from the most recent study visit should be used."

Clinical Deterioration and Rescue Therapy On-study rescue therapy (eg, high dose corticosteroid, plasma exchange [PE], or intravenous immunoglobulin [IVIg]) will be allowed when a patient experiences clinical deterioration as defined in this protocol. The rescue therapy used for a particular patient will be at the discretion of the Investigator. Every effort should be made to notify the Sponsor within 24 hours should a patient require rescue therapy. For this protocol, clinical deterioration warranting the use of o n-study rescue therapy is defined as follows: • Patients who experience an MG crisis, which is defined as weakness due to MG that is severe enough to necessitate intubation or to delay extubation following surgery; or, • Significant symptomatic worsening that requires rescue medication in the opinion of the Investigator; or, • Patients for whom the Investigator believes that the patients’ health is in jeopardy if rescue therapy is not given. 4.3.2. Clinical Evaluator Clinical Evaluators are study staff that have been trained and certified in administering the QMG, MG- ADL, and MGC. The Clinical Evaluator may be a neurologist, physical therapist, or other study team member delegated by the Investigator. Clinical Evaluator training and certification for this protocol will take place either at the Investigator's meeting or via the Sponsor's designated online training portal or other mechanism. 4.3.3. Responsibilities for Myasthenia Gravis Assessments Responsibilities for MG assessments are summarized in Table 12. Throughout the study, MG assessments for an individual patient should be performed at approximately the same time of day by a properly trained evaluator, preferably the same evaluator.

STUDY POPULATION The study will enroll at least 12 eligible refractory pediatric gMG patients 12 to < 18 years of age to receive open -label eculizumab infusion, in order to obtain at least 10 evaluable patients aged 12 to < 18 years for the primary endpoint, taking into account potential dropouts. Additional patients between the ages of 6 and 12 may be enrolled, but will not be included in the primary analysis. The number of eligible refractory pediatric gMG patients aged 12 to < 18 entering on maintenance IVIg treatment in this study will be capped at 6 patients . These patients must have been on maintenance IVIg for at least 12 months and on a stable dose ≥ 3 months prior to Screening, with frequency and dose expected to remain stable during Screening and for 12 weeks follo wing the first dose of study drug. E fforts will be made to enroll at least 1 patient in each geographic region (North America, EU, and APAC). After 6 patients complete their Week 26 assessments, if the observed standard deviation in change in QMG is 8 or h igher, the final sample size will be re -estimated to be at least 14 instead of 12 to preserve adequate power for testing the primary endpoint. Patients are eligible to be included in the study only if they satisfy all of the following inclusion/exclusion criteria. The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor must approve enrollment for each eligible patient. Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrollment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted. 5.1. Inclusion Criteria Patients must meet all of the following inclusion criteria: 1. Male or female pediatric patients 6 to < 18 years of age at time of assent/consent. 2. Patient’s legal guardian must be willing and able to give written informed permission and the patient must be willing to give written informed assent (if applicable as determined by the central or local Institutional Review Board [IRB]/Institutional [or Independent] Ethics Committee [IEC]) and comply with the study visit schedule. 3. Parent or other legal guardian must be willing to comply with study requirements for the duration of the study. 4. Vaccinated against N meningitidis within 3 years prior to, or at the time of, initiating eculizumab. Patients who initiate study drug treatment less than 2 weeks after receiving a meningococcal vaccine must receive appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after the vaccination. 5. Documented vaccination against H influenzae and S pneumoniae infections prior to dosing as per local and country specific immunization guidelines for the appropriate age group. 6. Diagnosis of MG confirmed by positive serologic test for anti- AChR-Ab at Screening, and one of the following: a. History of abnormal neuromuscular transmission test demonstrated by single - fiber electromyography or repetitive nerve stimulation, or"
72,page_72,"Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) 28 Sep 2020 Page 73 of 123 Alexion Confidential b. History of positive anticholinesterase test (eg, edrophonium chloride or neostigmine test), or c. Patient demonstrated improvement in MG signs on oral AChIs, as assessed by the Investigator. 7. Presence of refractory gMG, defined as patients with gMG who have one or more of the following : a. Failed treatment ≥ 1 year with at least 1 IST, defined as: i. Persistent weakness with impairment of activities of daily living, or ii. Myasthenia gravis exacerbation and/or crisis while on treatment, or iii. Intolerance to ISTs due to side effect or comorbid condition(s). Immunosuppressants include, but are not limited to, corticosteroids, AZA, MMF, methotrexate (MTX), cyclosporine, tacrolimu s, or cyclophosphamide. b. Require maintenance plasma exchange (PE) or IVIg to control symptoms (ie, patients who require PE or IVIg on a regular basis for the management of muscle weakness at least every 3 months over the last 12 months prior to Screening). c.

Efficacy, safety, and PK/PD data obtained from this study, combined with data from the refractory gMG clinical program in patients aged ≥ 18 year s and data from other indications in which eculizumab has been developed and for which pediatric data are available, is designed to inform the dose regimen and efficacy and safety profile of eculizumab in pediatric refractory gMG patients. 5.4. Discontinuations 5.4.1. Discontinuation of Patients The criteria for enrollment must be followed explicitly. If the investigational site identifies a patient who did not meet enrollment criteria and who was inadvertently enrolled, the Sponsor must be notified. If the Sponsor ide ntifies a patient who did not meet enrollment criteria and who was inadvertently enrolled, the investigational site will be notified. A discussion must occur between the Sponsor and the Investigator to determine whether the patient may continue in the study, with or without study drug. Inadvertently enrolled patients may be maintained in the study and on study drug when the Sponsor agrees with the Investigator that it is medically appropriate for that patient. The Investigator must obtain documented approval from the Sponsor to allow the inadvertently enrolled patient to continue in the study with or without study drug. Patients will be permanently discontinued from the study in the following circumstances: • Enrollment in any other clinical study involving an investigational product or enrollment in any other type of medical research judged not to be scientifically or medically compatible with this study • Any of the following occur during the study: − Serious hypersensitive reactions (eg, anaphylaxis, bronchospasm with wheezing or requiring ventilator support or symptomatic hypotension, clinical syndrome suggestive of serum sickness, vasculitis) − Severe uncontrolled infection − Pregnancy or planned pregnancy • Adverse Event − If the Investigator decides that the patien t should be withdrawn because of a serious adverse event (SAE) or a clinically significant laboratory value, the study drug is to be discontinued and appropriate measures are to be taken. The Sponsor or its designee is to be alerted immediately. Refer to Section 9. • Investigator Decision [Physician Decision] − The Investigator decides that the patient should be discontinued from the study in the best int erest of the patient. • Patient Decision [Withdrawal by Patient or Withdrawal by Parent/Guardian]"

Gently invert the infusion bag containing the diluted study drug solution to ensure thorough mixing of the product and diluents. Discard any unused portion left in a vial, as the product contains no preservatives. The diluted solution should be allowed to warm to room temperature by exposure to ambient air prior to administration. 6.1.4. Study Drug Administration Study drug should only be administered via IV infusion, using a weight -based schedule (Section 6.2). DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN IV PUSH OR BOLUS INJECTION. Prior to study drug administration, the diluted solution should be allowed to warm to room temperature by exposure to ambient air. The diluted solution must not be heated in a microwave or with any heat source other than ambient air temperature. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. The diluted study drug should be intravenously administered over 1 to 4 hours in pediatric patients. For those patients who reach ≥ 18 years of age during the study, the study drug should be administered intravenously over 35 (± 10) minutes. It is not necessary to protect the infusion bags from light while study drug is being administered to the patient. The patient should be monitored for at least 1 hour following infusion. If an AE occurs during administration of the study drug, the infusion may be slowed or stopped at the discretion of the Investigator, depending upon the nature and severity of the event; however, the overall duration should not exceed 2 hours from the start of the infusion in patients aged ≥ 18 years and 4 hours from the start of infusion in pediatric patients. In patients aged ≥ 18 years on maintenance IVIg, the overall duration should not exceed 4 hours from the start of the infusion. The AE must be captured in the patient’s source document and eCRF. The actual start and stop times of all dose administrations will be recorded in the patient’s source documents and eCRF. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional directions on study drug administration. Sites must have resuscitation equipment, emergency drugs, and appropriately trained staff available during the infusion, and for at least 1 hour after patients have completed their infusion. 6.1.5. Study Drug Accountability When a stud y drug shipment is received at the site, the pharmacist should verify the contents, sign the packing invoice provided with the shipment, and maintain the original copy for review by the study monitor. Additionally, reception of study drug (as well as reception conditions)"
78,page_78,"Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) 28 Sep 2020 Page 79 of 123 Alexion Confidential must be reported to the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) system to allow drug randomization, resupply, estimations, and drug expiration control. Unless notified otherwise, empty vials and vials with residual materials should be kept for inspection and accountability by the study monitor prior to their destruction or handled per local pharmacy standard operating procedures (SOPs) for clinical study drugs. Destruction of used and unused vials, either locally or centrally, must be properly documented. Drug accountability will be managed through the IRT system and detailed instructions on managing the IRT drug accountability module will be included in the IRT User Guide. The IRT module will perform accountability in two stages, where site personnel will complete an initial accountability entry in the system followed by confirmation by the CRA that the site has correctly entered the appropriate status for all IP. The pharmacist or designee must maintain accurate records demonstrating dates and amount of IP received, to whom dispensed (subject-by-subject accounting), and accounts of any IP accidentally or deliberately destroyed. These drug accountability records must be readily available upon request and will be reviewed throughout the study. Each kit will have a label and a place for the pharmacist to record the patient number and initials. The study monitor will examine the inventory during the study. Additionally, the inventory records must be readily available to regulatory authorities, th e local regulatory agency, or an independent auditor’s inspection at any time. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional information. 6.1.6. Study Drug Handling and Disposal All clinical study material provided to the Investigator will be stored in a secure place and allocated and dispensed by appropriately trained personnel. Detailed records of the amounts of the study drug received, dispensed, and destroyed will be maintained. To satisfy regulatory requirements regarding drug accountability, all remaining eculizumab inventory will be reconciled and destroyed or returned to Alexion at the end of the study according to applicable regulations. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for fu rther information. 6.2. Dosing Regimen 6.2.1. Rationale for Selection of Doses in the Study The doses of eculizumab to be administered in this study have been selected to produce eculizumab trough concentration coverage comparable to that observed in Study ECU- MG-301, in which the efficacy and safety of eculizumab in adult patients (18 years of age or older) with refractory AChR -Ab positive gMG was established. A modeling and simulation study was completed to support the planned bodyweight- categorized dose r egimens, which is described in further detail below. Demonstrating PK bridging between aHUS and refractory gMG patients aged ≥ 18 years was critical to select dose regimens for pediatric patients with refractory gMG, as substantial pediatric data has been generated for pediatric patients with aHUS, and no prior PK data from"
79,page_79,"Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) 28 Sep 2020 Page 80 of 123 Alexion Confidential pediatric patients with refractory gMG exists. The successful PK bridging enables extrapolation of the aHUS pediatric data and corresponding PK model to pediatric patients with refractory gMG. Simulations using the aHUS PK model and gMG PK model, respectively, demonstrated the comparability of eculizumab serum concentration time profiles between patients with aHUS and patients with refractory gMG for body weight ≥ 40 kg. Demonstrating PD bridging between aHUS/paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and patients aged ≥ 18 years with refractory gMG was also important. Using PK and PD data from patients aged ≥ 18 years and pediatric patients with aHUS and patients aged ≥ 18 years and pedia tric patients with PNH, the PK/PD (hemolysis) analysis identified an eculizumab threshold concentration range of 50-100 μg/mL to achieve complete inhibition of hemolysis. Using PK and PD data from patients aged ≥ 18 years with refractory gMG from Studies C08-001 and ECU- MG-301, the PK/PD analysis of hemolysis or free C5 identified an eculizumab threshold serum concentration of 85 μg/mL to achieve complete inhibition of hemolysis, which is within the range of 50-100 μg/mL identified above in aHUS. Therefor e, the PD bridging was successfully demonstrated between the 2 indications. In both aHUS and gMG PK models, body weight was identified as the only important covariate and, therefore, body weight categorical- based dosing is recommended in the pediatric population. The body weight exponent for the aHUS PK model was used, because the aHUS PK model leveraged the prior pediatric PK data within the weight range of interest. The aHUS PK model was used to simulate eculizumab concentration time profiles for the pediatric patients with refractory gMG. The simulation results showed that overall the proposed dosing regimens across the body weight categories essentially maintained therapeutic levels of eculizumab. Hence, the proposed bodyweight-categorized dosing regime ns are expected to achieve immediate, sustained, and complete inhibition of terminal complement in pediatric patients with refractory gMG. Complete and sustained inhibition of complement activity will be confirmed with PK/ PD data derived from this study. 6.2.2. Dosing Regimen Preparation and Administration Eculizumab will be administered weekly during the initial induction phase and every 2 weeks during the maintenance phase. The dosing regimen will be based on the pediatric patient’s body weight ( Table 15 ). Table 15: Weight- based Dosing Regimen of Eculizumab Weight Cohortab Induction Phase Maintenance Phase ≥ 40 kg 900 mg weekly × 4 doses 1200 mg at Week 4; then every 2 weeks 30 to < 40 kg 600 mg weekly × 2 doses 900 mg at Week 2; then every 2 weeks 20 to < 30 kg 600 mg weekly × 2 doses 600 mg at Week 2; then every 2 weeks 10 to < 20 kg 600 mg weekly × 1 dose 300 mg at Week 1; then every 2 weeks a Dose regimen will be based on the current visit’s recorded body weight. If site/institution policies prohibit study drug to be prepared day- of visit, the weight from the most recent study visit should be used b During the initial induction phase, if a patient’s weight increases or decreases resulting in a change in weight cohort, the Alexion medical monitor must be contacted prior to dosing ."
80,page_80,"Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) 28 Sep 2020 Page 81 of 123 Alexion Confidential Eculizumab 300 mg, 600 mg, 900 mg, or 1200 mg will be administered via IV infusion based on the patient’s most recently recorded body weight at a prior dosing visit, as presented in Table 15. Doses of study drug must only be prepared and dispensed by qualified study personnel. Study drug is to be dispensed only to enrolled patients who are confirmed eligible for participation in this study. Once study drug is prepared for a patient, it can only be administered to that patient. Vials of study drug are for one-time use only, and any drug product remaining in the vial should not be used for another patient. Any drug remaining in the infusion tubing or infusion bag should not be used for another patient. Further details on preparation and dose administration of eculizumab, as well as disposal of the study drug, can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. 6.2.3. Supplemental Eculizumab Doses in Patients Receiving Ma intenance IVIg Treatment Maintenance IVIg treatment may interfere with the endosomal neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) recycling mechanism of monoclonal antibodies and, thus, may decrease serum eculizumab concentrations ( Jin, 2005; Wang, 2008; Fitzpatrick, 2011). Fitzpatrick et al reported that, in adult multifocal motor neuropathy, patients receiving cycles of IVIg 1 g/kg over 1 to 5 days and repeated on average at 4 -weekly intervals, eculizumab treatment resulted in a significantly lower median eculizumab exposure (78.7 μg/mL, interquartile range [IQR] 55–108) compared to exposure in patients not receiving IVIg (119.7 μg/mL, IQR 95–147), which translates to an approximate median increa se of 50% in the clearance of eculizumab under IVIg co- administration (Fitzpatrick, 2011). Therefore, for pediatric gMG patients receiving maintenance IVIg treatment, a series of supplemental doses of eculizumab will be admi nistered to account for the anticipated approximately 50% increase in eculizumab clearance. For further details on supplemental dosing, please refer to Table 16. In addition, patients are to continue eculizumab infusion according to the protocol- specified dosing regimen."

Notes: The timing of supplemental eculizuma b dosing varies by IVIg frequency and is provided below: • If a patient continues to receive IVIg treatment at a dose cycle interval equal to or more frequent than every 4 weeks during eculizumab treatment, a supplemental dose will be administered at the sam e time that each scheduled dose of eculizumab is administered. • If a patient receives IVIg treatment at a dose cycle interval less frequent than every 4 weeks during eculizumab treatment, a supplemental dose will be administered following the last dose of the IVIg infusion cycle at the next scheduled eculizumab dose. If a patient receives IVIg treatment within 4 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of eculizumab, a supplemental dose of eculizumab will be administered at the same time that the first dose of eculizumab is administered (ie, the total dose is the supplemental dose plus the first scheduled dose). For patients who enter the study on a stable IVIg maintenance dose regimen, PK/PD samples will be analyzed after the first 4 weeks of eculizumab administration for the evaluation of eculizumab exposure. If the PK concentration values are greater than 1790 µg/mL (Alexion Internal Report: ECU -MG-Adult PK-PD Modeling Report, Addendum ECU- MG-302), the maximum concentration value observed in Studies E CU-MG-301 and ECU- MG-302 in patients with refractory gMG, the supplemental dose of eculizumab may be adjusted downward or waived, as appropriate, so that the predicted maximum PK concentration is below 1790 μg/mL. 6.2.4. Supplemental Eculizumab Doses Following Re scue Therapy When IVIg is administered as acute rescue therapy for clinical deterioration, no supplemental dose of eculizumab should be administered. However, if a patient receives more than 1 dose cycle of IVIg as rescue therapy within a 12 -week period, supplemental eculizumab should be administered after the last dose of the second IVIg cycle and at the end of each subsequent IVIg dose cycle within the 12 -week period in accordance with Table 16. If a patient undergoes PP/PE/FFP for clinical deterioration during the study, a supplemental dose of study drug must be administered within 1 to 2 hours after each PP/PE/FFP session unless the PP/PE/FFP session is on the day of a scheduled study drug infusion. If FFP has been administered, a supplemental dose of study drug must be administered 1 hour prior to each"

Subsequent supplemental dosing will be informed as described in Section 6.2.3. • Plasma Exchange/Plasmapheresis/Fresh Frozen Plasma (PE/ PP/FFP) − Use of PE/PP/FFP will be allowed as rescue therapy for patients who experience a clinical deterioration as defined by this protocol. The rescue therapy used for an individual patient will be at the discretion of the treating physician. Every effort should be made to notify the Sponsor within 24 hours should a patient require a rescue therapy. − If a patient undergoes PE during the study, a supplemental dose of study drug must be administered ( Section 6.2.4 ). 6.3.2. Disallowed Medications The use of rituximab and SC Ig is prohibited during the study. 6.3.3. Clinical Deterioration and Rescue Therapies The use of permitted on- study rescue therapy is described in Section 4.3.1. 6.3.4. Vaccination As with any terminal complement antagonist, the use of eculizumab increases the patient’s susceptibility to meningococcal infection ( N meningitidis ). To reduce the risk of mening ococcal infection, all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcal infections within the 3 years prior to, or at the time of, initiating study drug. Patients who initiate study drug treatment less than 2 weeks after receiving a meningococcal vaccine must receive treatment with appropriate prophylactic antibiotics until 2 weeks after vaccination. Patients must be vaccinated or revaccinated according to current national vaccination guidelines or local practice for vaccination use with complement- inhibitors (eg, eculizumab) . Vaccines against serotypes A, C, Y, W135, and B, where available, are recommended to prevent common pathogenic meningococcal serotypes."

In addition to meningococcal vaccination, patients must be vaccinated against H influenzae and S pneumoniae , and strictly adhere to the national vaccination recommendations for each age group. Due to the length of the Extension Period of this study, patients may be revaccinated for appropriate vaccinations based on adherence to the national vaccination recommendations for each age group to provide active coverage according to current medical/coun try guidelines. Investigators will assess the need for revaccination, which will be recorded in the source documents and electronic case report form (eCRF). 6.4. Treatment Compliance The infusion of study drug into patients will be under the supervision of the Investigator or their designee to ensure that the patients received the appropriate dose at the appropriate time-points during the study. Patients who fail to return for a scheduled visit within the acceptable visit windows (±2 days) must be contacted by t he site study staff to determine the reason for missing the appointment. Patients should be strongly encouraged to return to the investigational site for evaluation if clinical deterioration or an AE is suspected to have occurred. In the exceptional circumstance, if a patient cannot or does not come to the study site for examination, the patient will be instructed to see his or her local neurologist or physician. In this event, the investigational site will (or attempt to) obtain relevant medical records as documentation from the local physician’s examination, and enter relevant data in the eCRF as appropriate. As it is vital to obtain information on any patient’s missing visit (in -clinic or remote) to assure the missing appointment was not due to a clinica l deterioration or an AE, every effort must be made to undertake protocol- specified follow -up procedures ( Table 5 and Table 7 based on weight cohort). Follow-up due-diligence documentation will consist of 3 phone calls followed by 1 registered letter to the patient’s last known address, and documented in both the source documents and the eCRF. Patients should be registered in the IXRS as soon as the Study ECU -MG-303 informed consent form (ICF) is signed. The initial shipment of study drug for Study ECU- MG-303 will be trigg ered by the IXRS. 6.5. Continued Access to Study Drug After completing the 26 -week Primary Evaluation Treatment Period, patients will continue receiving eculizumab in the Extension Period for up to additional 208 weeks."

ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY Efficacy assessments will be performed as summarized in the Schedules of Assessments (Section 4.2). Preferably, the same parent or guardian is recommended to be available to accompany the child to each visit in order to reduce variability in endpoint reporting. 7.1. Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis Score The QMG scoring system consists of 13 items: ocular (2 items), facial (1 item), bulbar (2 items), gross motor (6 items), axial (1 item), and respiratory (1 item); each graded 0 to 3, with 3 being the most severe ( Appendix 1). The range of total QMG score is 0 to 39. The QMG scoring system is considered to be an objective evaluation of therapy for MG and is based on quantitative testing of sentinel muscle groups. The MGFA task force has recommended that the QMG score be used in prospective studies of therapy for MG. A modified QMG score has been developed for use in patients younger than 12 years of age that will be used for patients aged 6 to 11 years at the time of Screening ( Goldstein , 2015 ; Appendix 2). The modified QMG omits the assessment of grip strength and uses a modified assessment of swallowing (slurp test) compared to the traditional QMG, with total scores ranging from 0 to 21. In this study, patients will continue to be evaluated based on the QMG scale initially completed upon entry into the study. Change in age during the study will not constitute a patient changi ng the type of survey completed (ie, a patient who enrolls at age 11 will continue being assessed with the modified QMG scale even after he or she reaches 12 years of age). The QMG assessment will be administered at the protocol -specified time points at ap proximately the same time of day by a properly trained evaluator, preferably the same evaluator, throughout the study. 7.2. Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living Score The MG -ADL is an 8 -point questionnaire that focuses on relevant symptoms and functiona l performance of activities of daily living in MG patients (Appendix 3). The 8 items of the MG-ADL were derived from symptom- based components of the original 13- item QMG to assess disability secondary to ocular (2 items), bulbar (3 items), respiratory (1 item), and gross motor or limb (2 items) impairment related to effects from MG. In this functional status instrument, each response is graded 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe). The range of total MG -ADL score is 0 to 24. The recall period for MG -ADL is the preceding 7 days or since the last visit if the visit interval is less than 7 days. The MG -ADL assessment will be administered at the p rotocol- specified time points at approximately the same time of day by a properly trained evaluator, preferably the same evaluator, throughout the study. For patients <12 years of age, caregiver assistance can be provided during the MG -ADL assessment. 7.3. Mya sthenia Gravis Composite Score The MGC is a validated assessment tool for measuring clinical status of patients with MG (Burns, 2010). The MGC assesses 10 important functional areas most frequently affected by MG, and the scales ar e weighted for clinical significance that incorporates patient- reported outcomes ( Appendix 4). The range of total MGC score is 0 to 50. Higher score s indicate more"
86,page_86,"Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) 28 Sep 2020 Page 87 of 123 Alexion Confidential functional impairment. In this study, the MGC assessment will be administered at the protocol-specified time points at approximately the same time of day by a properly trained evaluator, preferably the same evaluator, throughout the study. 7.4. Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America Post- Intervention Status The MG clinical state will be assessed using the MGFA Post -Intervention Status. Change in status categories of Improved, Unchanged, Worse, as well as the Minimal Manifestation will be assessed by the PI or the same neurologist skilled in the evaluation of MG patients throughout the study ( Appendix 11). 7.5. European Quality of Life 5- Dimension The EQ -5D- Y (Appendix 5) is a reliable and validated survey of health status in 5 areas: mobility, self- care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, each of which is completed by the patient for patients ≥ 12 years of age (at time of assessment) and completed by the patient’s caregiver or with caregiver assistance for patients <12 years of age ( Szen de, 2014). Each area has 3 levels: Level 1 (no problems), Level 2 (some problems), and Level 3 (extreme problems). The EQ visual analogue scale (VAS) records the patient’s self -rated health on a vertical, 20 cm VAS where the endpoints are labeled ‘Best imaginable health state, marked as 100’ and ‘Worst imaginable health state, marked as 0’. Patients will continue to be evaluated based on the survey initially completed upon entry into the study. Change in age during the study will not constitute a patient changing the type of survey completed. Patients who are younger than the lowest age range of the survey (ie, patients < 8 years of age) will be evaluated using the proxy version of the EQ-5D- Y (Appendix 6). The parent or legal guardian (the proxy) will be asked to rate the child’s health -related quality of life in their (the proxy’s) opinion. The EQ -5D- Y assessment will be administered at the protocol-specified time points at approximately the same time of day throughout the study. 7.6. Neurological Quality of Life Fatigue Questionnaire The Neuro- QoL Pediatric Fatigue questionnaire ( Appendix 7) is a reliable and validated brief 11-item survey of fatigue, completed by the patient for patients ≥ 12 years of age (at time of assessment) and completed by the patient’s caregiver or with caregiver assistance f or patients <12 years of age ( Cella, 2010). Higher scores indicate greater fatigue and greater impact of MG on activities. Patients will continue to be evaluated based on the survey initially completed upon entry into the study. Change in age during the study will not constitute a patient changing the type of survey completed. Patients who are younger than the lowest age range of the applicable scale (ie, patients < 8 years of age) will be evaluated using the PROMIS Parent Proxy Item Bank v2.0 – Fatigue – Short Form 10a questionnaire ( Appendix 8). The parent or legal guardian (the proxy) will complete the measure on the child’s behalf following administration of these instructions: “The following questionnaires will ask about your child’s symptoms and activity levels; his/her ability to think, concentrate and remember things; questions specific to his/her condition, and questions related to his/her quality of life. Please answer the following questions based on what you think your child would say.” The Neuro-QoL Pediatric Fatigue questionnaire will be administered at the protocol- specified time points at approximately the same time of day throughout the study."

Myasthenia Gravis Disease Biomarker Blood samples for assay of the AChR- Ab will be collected at Screening as specified in the Schedules of Assessments ( Section 4.2). 8.2. Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Blood samples will be collected at specified time points to study the PK of eculizumab in pediatric patients with refractory gMG. Pharmacok inetic parameters such as maximum concentration and concentration after the first dose, and during the induction and maintenance treatment phase will be obtained. Clearance and terminal half -life will be estimated. Blood samples for PD analysis will be collected at specified time points to assess pre-and post- treatment serum hemolytic activity and, therefore, C5 complement activity inhibition. Baseline PK and PD samples will be collected 5 -90 minutes prior to the first dose, and peak samples will be collect ed 60 -120 minutes after the first dose and at other time points in the SoA. An intermediate blood sample will also be collected 24 hours after completion of the first dose. For the sample collected at 24 hours, there will be a window of ± 1 hour for collecting the sample. The date and exact time of collection must be recorded on the eCRF and the central laboratory requisition form. Blood samples collected for PK and PD will be kept frozen and stored at Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for a maximum of 5 years after all the specified PK and PD data will have been collected for the study. The frozen samples may be used for future research related to eculizumab. Each sample will be given a code. This code will allow the patient sample to be used without the researchers knowing the patient’s name. The results of the research may be presented at scientific meetings or in publications; however, patient identity will not be disclosed. All other blood and urine samples collected during the study will be destroyed after the tests have been completed."
88,page_88,"Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) 28 Sep 2020 Page 89 of 123 Alexion Confidential 9. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY The collection of AEs will be monitored from the signing of informed consent until study completion. Investigators are instructed to follow any AEs through to their conclusion (resolution or stabilization ) as described in Section 9.6.8. In the event of patient withdrawal from the study, AE monitoring should continue through the last patient’s last study visit if possible. The timing of the clinical and laboratory assessments to be performed is specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Section 4.2). Any clinically significant abnormal results should be followed until resolution or stabilization. 9.1. Physical Examinations Each examination will include the following assessments: general appearance of skin, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck, lymph nodes, chest, heart, abdomen, extremities, and general neurologic system. Physical growth (height [cm], weight [kg]) will be assesse d. The accurate weighing of patients is vital as part of their management, as eculizumab dosing will depend on the patient’s recorded body weight at the most recent dosing visit. It is recommended that patients should be weighed in the same amount of cloth ing in each instance where weight is assessed. 9.2. Vital Signs Vital sign measurements will be taken after the patient has been resting for at least 5 minutes and will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure (millimeters of mercury [mmHg]), heart rate (beats/minute), respiratory rate (breaths/minute), and temperature (degrees Celsius [°C] or degrees Fahrenheit [°F]). Vital signs will be taken prior to each administration of study drug. 9.3. Laboratory Assessments (Pregnancy Screen, Serum Chemistry, and Hematology) Samples for urine pregnancy, hematology, and chemistry will be performed at the times specified for clinical laboratory tests in the Schedule of Assessments (Section 4.2). Specific laboratory assessments are provided in Appendix 12. For clinic visits indicating laboratory assessments as req uired, the samples for laboratory assessments will be collected before administration of study drug. It is anticipated that some laboratory values may be outside the normal value range due to underlying disease. The Investigators should use their medical judgment when assessing the clinical significance of these values. Clinical significance is defined as any variation in laboratory measurements that has medical relevance and that results in a change in medical care. If clinically significant laboratory ch anges from Baseline resulting in medical intervention are noted, the changes will be documented as AEs on the AE eCRF. The Investigator will also assess the relationship to study drug for all clinically significant out -of-range values ( Section 9.6.5). The Investigator will continue to monitor the patient through additional laboratory assessments until (1) values have returned to the normal range or baseline level, or (2) in the judgment of the Investigator, values that are outside the normal range are not related to the administration of study drug or other protocol- specific procedures."
89,page_89,"Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) 28 Sep 2020 Page 90 of 123 Alexion Confidential 9.4. Electrocardiograms For each patient, 12- lead digital electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be collected according to the Schedule of Assessments (Section 4.2). Patients must be supine for approximately 5 to 10 minutes before ECG collection and remain supine but awake during ECG collection. The Investigator or designee will be responsible for reviewing the ECG to assess whether the ECG is within normal limits and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments will be indicated on the CRF. For any clinically significant abnormal ECG results, the Investigator must contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the patient’s continued eligibility to participate in this protocol. 9.5. Immunogenicity Blood samples will be collected to test for the presence and titer of ADAs to eculizumab in serum as indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Section 4.2). Further characterization of antibody responses may be conducted as appropriate, including binding and neutralizing antibodies, to PK/PD, safety, and activity of eculizumab. Refer to the Laboratory Manual for time windows for sample collection and detai led instructions for collecting, processing, storing, and shipping blood samples for immunogenicity analysis. 9.6. Adverse Event Management 9.6.1. Detection of Adverse Events The Investigator is responsible for detecting, assessing, documenting, and reporting all AEs. Adverse events reported by the patient and/or parent or legal guardian, identified in response to an open-ended question from study personnel, or revealed by observation, physical examination, or other study procedures must be collected and recorded as de scribed in Section 9.6.3. The same parent or guardian is recommended to be available to accompany the patient to each visit, in order to reduce subjective variability in assessments. 9.6.2. Definition of Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study patient administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition, in cluding either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition, and abnormal laboratory findings that are considered to be of clinical significance are all to be considered AEs. A medication error (including intentional misuse, abuse, and overdose of the product) or use other than what is defined in the protocol is not considered an AE unless there is an untoward medical occurrence as a result of a medication error."
90,page_90,"Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) 28 Sep 2020 Page 91 of 123 Alexion Confidential Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or elec tive admission to a hospital), and anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen are not AEs. 9.6.2.1. Procedure Elective procedures that were preplanned prior to the time that written ICF was obtained are not AEs. Any complication or worsening of a pre-existing condition leading to the procedure must be considered an AE. In addition, any AE that could occur as an outcome of the planned procedure should be considered as an AE. Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (invasive and noninvasive), such as surgery or angiography, should not be reported as an AE or SAE. However, the medical condition or the diagnosis that was responsible for the procedure should be recorded. The procedure should be recorded in the narrative as treatment for the AE or SAE (eg, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the procedure or treatment for an SAE of necrotic gall bladder). 9.6.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings Abnormal test findings may be considered AEs or SAEs; however, Investigators are strongly encouraged to report the diagnosis, sign, or symptom instead of just the abnormal result. The criteria for an abnormal test finding being classified as an AE or SAE are as follows: • Test result is associated with a sign or symptom • Test result requires additional diagnostic testing • Test result requires a medical or surgical intervention • Test result leads to a change in study dosing outside of the protocol defined dosing or discontinuation from the study • Test result requires significant additional treatment (ie, addition of new medication, significant increase in dose of current medication) 9.6.2.3. Lack of Efficacy Since eculizumab treatment in pediatric patients with refractory gMG is not an approved indication for this popula tion, lack of efficacy should not be reported as an AE. 9.6.2.4. Development of Myasthenia Gravis Clinical Deterioration Normal day -to-day fluctuations of the underlying study indication are not considered an AE unless it is so in the opinion of the Investigator. W orsening of underlying study indication that meets the SAE criteria should be reported as an SAE. 9.6.3. Recording Adverse Events Cases of pregnancy that occur during maternal or paternal exposure to the study drug are to be reported within 24 hours of Investigat or/site awareness. Data on fetal outcome and breastfeeding will be collected for regulatory reporting and safety evaluation."
91,page_91,"Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) 28 Sep 2020 Page 92 of 123 Alexion Confidential All AEs (serious and nonserious) will be collected from the signing of the ICF. An AE reported after informed consent but before study drug administration will be considered a pretreatment AE. Alexion has reporting standards for AEs that are to be followed as described in Section 9.6.8 regardless of applicable regulatory requirements that may be less stringent. 9.6.4. Severity Assessment The severity (intensity) of an AE will be rated by the Investigator as mild, moderate, or sev ere using the following criteria: • Mild: events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the patient’s daily activities. • Moderate: events result in a low level of inconvenience or concerns with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning. • Severe: events interrupt a patient’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating. Change in severity of an AE should be documented based on specific instructions in the eCRF Completion Guidelines. Severity and seriousness must be differentiated. Severity describes the intensity of an AE, while the term seriousness refers to an AE that has met the criteria for an SAE (Section 9.6.6 ). 9.6.5. Causality Assessment An Investigator causality assessment (not related or related) must be provided for all AEs, both serious and nonserious based upon the Investigator’s medical judgement and the observed symptoms associated with the event ( Table 18). This assessment must be recorded in the eCRF and any additional forms as appropriate. Table 18: Causality Assessment Descriptions Assessment Description Not Related This relationship suggests that there is no causal association between the study drug and the reported event. Related This relationship suggests that there is causal association between the investigational product and the reported event 9.6.6. Definition of Serious Adverse Event Any AE that fulfills any 1 of the criteria listed below must be recorded as an SAE. An SAE (experience) or reaction is described as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 1. Results in death 2. Is life -threatening"
92,page_92,"Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) 28 Sep 2020 Page 93 of 123 Alexion Confidential NOTE: The term ""life -threatening"" in the definition of ""serious"" refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 5. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Important medical events that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require hospitalization, may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may j eopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. The expectedness of an SAE will be determined by Alexion, based on the current version of the eculizumab IB. Information pertaining to the collection and reporting of SAEs is provided in Section 9.6.6. 9.6.7. Serious Adverse Event With Outcome of Death If a patient experiences an SAE with an outcome of death : • The SAE resulting in death should have an outcome documented as death/fatal with an end date being the date of death. • If the patient had additional AE/SAEs that were ongoing at the time of death, these events would be documented as ongoing with no end date. • Only one event should have an outcome of death/fatal unless an autopsy report or Investigator states otherwise. 9.6.8. Hospitalization Adverse events that are associated with hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization are considered SAEs. All admissions to a health care facility meet this criteria, even if less than 24 hours. Criteria for seriousness are also met if transfer within the hospital is done to receive more intense medical / surgical care (eg, medical floor to the intensive care unit [ICU]). Hospitalization does not include the following: • Rehabilitation facility • Hospice facility • Nursing facility • Emergency Room • Same day surgery Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization not associated with an AE is not an SAE, examples include: • Admission for a pre-existing condition not associated with either a new AE or with worsening of a pre-existing AE"

Collection and Reporting of Adverse Events 9.6.9.1. All Adverse Events All AEs (serious and nonseri ous) will be collected from the signing of the ICF until 8 weeks after the last dose of study drug for patients who discontinue or until 8 weeks after the last dose of study drug for patients who complete the study. All AEs must be recorded on the eCRF upon the Investigator or his/her staff becoming aware of their occurrence. Investigators will be instructed to report the SAE including their assessment (eg, severity, seriousness, and potential relatedness to study drug) to Alexion Global Drug Safety (GDS) within 24 hours of first awareness of the event via the Safety Gateway. If a patient’s treatment is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must clearly capture the circumstances and data leading to any such dose interruption or discontinuation of treatment in the AE and Exposure pages of the eCRF. For patients who enter the trial on maintenance IVIg therapy, IVIg administered as part of routine maintenance therapy in an inpa tient or outpa tient setting should not be captu red as AEs or S AEs, unless identified as such by the Inve stigator. 9.6.9.2. Serious Adverse Events All SAEs must be recorded regardless of the Investigator’s assessment of causality. No time limit exists on reporting SAEs that are thought to be causally related to the study drug. Investigators are at liberty to report SAEs irrespective of causality at any time. For all SAEs, the Investigator must provide the following: • Appropriate and requested follow- up information in the time frame detailed above • Causality of the serious event(s) • Seriousness criteria • Treatment of/intervention for the SAE(s) • Severity • Outcome of the serious event(s) • Supporting medical records and laboratory/diagnostic information All SAEs must be reported to Alexion GDS within 24 hours of the Investigator or site staff awareness. These timelines for reporting SAE information to the Sponsor need to be followed for the initial SAE report and for all follow -up SAE information. The Investigator or designee must record the SAE data in the eCRF and verify the accuracy of the information with corresponding source documents. The SAE report should be submitted electronically via the Safety Gateway."
94,page_94,"Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) 28 Sep 2020 Page 95 of 123 Alexion Confidential In the event that either the electronic data capture or the Safety Gateway is unavailable at the site(s), the SAE must be reported utilizing the paper contingency form via Facsimile transmission or email. Email: Facsimile: When further information be comes available, the eCRF should be updated with the new information and an updated SAE report should be submitted to Alexion GDS via the Safety Gateway. If applicable, additional information such as relevant medical records should be submitted to Alexion GDS via the email address or fax number noted above accompanied by the Investigator signed fax cover page. All paper forms and follow -up information submitted to the Sponsor outside of the Safety Gateway (eg, discharge summary) should be kept in the appro priate section of the study file. 9.6.9.3. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and that the Investigator identifies as related to the study drug or procedure. United States 21 CFR 312.32 and European Union Clinical Study Directive 2001/20/EC and the associated detailed guidances or national regulatory requirements in participating countries require the reporting of SUSARs. Alexion has procedures that will be followed for the recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with global regulations and the associated detailed guidances. Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions will be reported to the national competent authority and IRBs or IECs where applicable. 9.6.10. Sponsor Reporting Requirements Alexion GDS or its legal representative is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of SAEs meeting the reporting criteria. This protocol will use the current eculizumab IB as the Reference Safety Document. The expectedness and reporting criteria of an SAE will be determined by the Sponsor from the Reference Safety Document. 9.6.11. Investigator Reporting Requirements The Investigator must fulfill all local regulatory obligations required for study Investigators. It is the PI’s responsibility to notify the IRB or IEC of all SAEs that occur at his or her site. Investigators will also be notified of all SUSAR events that occur during the clinical study. Each site is responsible for no tifying its IRB or IEC of these additional SAEs. 9.7. Exposure During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding Pregnancy data will be collected during this study for all patients and female spouse/partner of male patients. Exposure during pregnancy (also referred to as exposure in utero) can be the result of either maternal exposure or transmission of drug product via semen following paternal exposure."
95,page_95,"Protocol ECU -MG-303, Version 4.0 Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alexion) 28 Sep 2020 Page 96 of 123 Alexion Confidential For all Alexion products, both in development or post-approval, exposure during pregnancy must be recorded and the pregnancy followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known (ie, spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, normal birth, or congenital abnormality), even if the patient discontinues study drug or withdraws from the study. If a female patient or a patient’s female partner becomes pregnant during the conduct of this study, the Investigator must submit the “Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome/Breastfeeding” form to Alexion GDS via fax or email (Section 9.6.9.2). When the outcome of the pregnancy becomes known, the form should be updated and submitted to Alexion GDS. If additional follow-up is required, the Investigator will be requested to provide the information. Exposure of an infant to an Alexion product during breastfeeding must also be reported (via the “Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome Form/Breastfeeding”) and any AEs experienced by the infant must be reported to Alexion GDS or designee via email or facsimile ( Section 9.6.8). Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the investigational product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. However, complications of pregnancy and abnormal outcomes of pregnancy are AEs and may meet the criteria for an SAE (eg, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly). Elective abortions without complications should not be reported as AEs. 9.8. Safety Monitoring The Alexion medical monitor, GDS physician, or both will monitor safety data throughout the course of the study. Alexion will review all information pertaining to the SAEs within the time frames mandate d by company procedures. The Alexion medical monitor will, as appropriate, consult with the GDS safety physician, to review trends in safety data."

General Considerations All summary statistics will be computed and displayed by v isit where applicable. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables will minimally include the following: n, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum. For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented. Graphical disp lays will be provided as appropriate. Unless otherwise stated, all statistical summaries will be displayed by younger (<12 years) and older (12 to < 18 years) age groups separately and/or combined. A two- sided Type I error of 5% will be used for statistical tests unless otherwise stated. The statistical modeling will be performed for the applicable endpoints only for the older age group, as very few patients are anticipated to be enrolled in the younger age group. Study data will be summarized by each age group and overall. All study data collected on the CRF and from other sources will be listed for individual patients. Baseline will be defined as the last non -missing value on or prior to first dose of eculizumab, unless otherwise stated. No imputation will be performed for missing efficacy data. The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed and finalized prior to the primary analysis and will provide further details. The primary analysis will be conducted when all patients have completed the 26- week Primary Evaluation Treatment Period or discontinued prior to the completion of the Primary Evaluation Treatment Period. This analysis will include all efficacy, safety, and PK/PD study data for regulatory submission purpose. Section 10.12 outlines the plan for subsequent interim analyses and the final analysis. Another SAP will be developed and finalized prior to the completion of the entire study (including the Extension Period). Analyses will be performed using the SAS ® software Version 9.4 or higher. 10.2. Hypotheses The null and alternative hypotheses related to primary endpoint for this study is described as: 𝐻𝐻0:𝜇𝜇= 0 𝑣𝑣𝑣𝑣 .𝐻𝐻1:𝜇𝜇 ≠ 0, where 𝜇𝜇 represents the mean improvement in QMG from Baseline over time regardless of rescue under null and alternate hypotheses. 10.3. Determination of Sample Size The sample size will be determined to ensure adequate power for testing the primary endpoint for this stu dy in the older age group. The assumptions regarding change from Baseline in QMG and MG-ADL scores were based on the subset of a younger patient population treated with eculizumab in Studies ECU- MG-301 and ECU- MG-302. Based on eleven younger (<25 years) patients from those studies, the mean and SD were calculated at both 12 and 26 weeks of eculizumab exposure ( Table 19)."

Similarly, assuming an improvement in MG -ADL total score at Week 26 with mean (SD) of 7 (5), a total of 10 patients will provide approximately 97% power. Likewise, based on a two-sided one- sample t -test with a significance level of 0.05 and assuming an improvement in QMG total score at Week 12 with mean (SD) of 9 (7), a total of 10 patients will provide approximately 95% power to detect a statistically significant improvement in QMG total score from Baseline. Similarly, assuming an improvement in MG -ADL total score at Week 12 with mean (SD) of 6 (5), a total of 10 patients will provide approximately 92% power. Assuming a loss of 15% of patients due to not meeting evaluability criteria, a total of at least 12 patients will be planned to be enrolled in the older age group for the primary analysis to enro ll at least 10 evaluable patients. There will be no statistical considerations to determine the number of patients to be enrolled in the younger age group. Section 10.3.1 provides additional information about sample size re -estimation. In addition, a maximum of 6 patients on maintenance IVIg aged 12 to < 18 years are eligible to be enrolled in the study. These patients must have been on maintenance I VIg for at least 12 months and on a stable dose ≥ 3 months prior to Screening, with frequency and dose expected to remain stable during Screening and for 12 weeks following the first dose of study drug. Efforts will be made to enroll at least 1 patient in each geographic region (North America, EU, and APAC). There is no cap on patients 6 to < 12 years of age. 10.3.1. Interim Monitoring of Variability and Sample Size Re -assessment Since the estimates provided in Table 19 are based on a small number of patients and it is unknown whether the variability in change in QMG in this study population is consistent with patients aged ≥ 18 years , an interim monitoring of the variability in change in QMG from Baseline will be performed. After 6 patients complete the Week 26 assessments, if the observed standard deviation in QMG change from Baseline is approximately 8 or higher, the final sample size will be re- estimated to be at least 14 patients instead of 12 patients to preserve adequate power for testing the primary and endpoint. 10.4. Analysis Sets 10.4.1. Full Analysis Set Efficacy analyses will be performed on the Full Analysis Set (FAS), which consists of all patients who received at least 1 dose of eculizumab . A subset of the FAS that includes older"

The FAS will be used for other efficacy results summaries by including younger patients (< 12 years of age), if any are enrolled. 10.4.2. Safety Set Safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Set, which consists of all patients who received at least 1 dose of eculizumab. 10.4.3. Other Analysis Set Pharmacokinetic/PD analyses will be performed on the PK/PD Analysis Set. The PK/PD Analysis Set will include patients who have PK/PD data assessments during this study. 10.5. Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Patient demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the Safety Set. Summary statistics will be presented. No formal hypothesis testing will be performed. 10.6. Patient Disposition The number of patients screened and the number of patients in different analysis sets will be summarize d. The number and percentage of patients discontinued will be summarized along with reasons for discontinuation in the Safety Set. 10.7. Prior and Concomitant Medications Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized for all patients in the Safety Set. Medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHODrug; the most current version available at the time of the analyses). 10.8. Efficacy Analyses 10.8.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from Baseline in the QMG total score over time regardless of rescue treatment. The primary efficacy analysis for the change from Baseline in the QMG total score will be conducted at Week 12 in order to assess the effect of eculizumab treatment during the Primary Evaluatio n Treatment Period after the 12 weeks during which MG medications (ie, ISTs, IVIg) are continued at a stable dose. The Paediatric Committee of the European Medicines Agency (PDCO)- specific primary efficacy analysis will be conducted at Week 26. The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the mFAS. A Repeated -Measures model will be used to analyze observed change in QMG with baseline QMG score and visits as covariates. The least -squares mean at Week 12 will be used to test the primary hypothesis at a significance level of 5%. The least -squares mean at Week 26 will be used to test the PDCO-specific primary hypothesis at a significance level of 5%. The standard error of the mean and 95% confidence interval will be produced. Missing primary endpoints at post -baseline visits will not be imputed."
