The net clinical effect of IRX5183 administration in patients with R/R -AML and HR -MDS will be a measurable improvement in hematologic parameters and / or a reduction in the b one marrow blast numbers. We predict that IRX5183 admi nistration will lead to differentiation and apoptosis of leukemia cells in patients with R/R -AML, causing measurable laboratory parameters of differentiation, which will correlate with clinical respons es and toxic events. STUDY OBJECTIVES: - Primary objectives : 1) To evaluate the safety and toxicity of IRX5183 in p atients with R/R -AML and HR -MDS and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). 2) To obtain preliminary efficacy data of IRX 5183 in patients with R/R -AML and HR -MDS after at least 2 cycles of therapy at the RP2D. - Secondary objectives : 1) To determine pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of IRX5183 and assess bioactivity through pharmacodynamics (PD) studie s. 2) To measure clinic al activity of IRX5183 as defined by best International Working Group (IWG) response at any time, time to response, improvement in transfusion requirements , cytopenias, quality of life assessments, event -free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) and t o determine the toxicity profile of IRX5183 at the optimal dose. STUDY DESIGN: This is a single -center open -label prospective phase I /II study with a n escalation and expansion ph ase evaluating the use of CYP26 resistant RAR  specific retinoid IRX5183 i n 1) patients with relapsed and/or refractory AML and 2) patients with high-risk MDS or CMML. The t reatment scheme is summarized below and the d ose escalation of IRX5183 is shown in Table 1 . IRX5183 will be administered orally daily on day s 1-28 of each c ycle for 2 cycles of induction . In the phase I part of the study, there will be 3 dose l evels (dose level 1 [DL1] with 50 mg, DL2 with 75 mg, and DL3 with 100 mg), with 1 additional dose level to be only used if excessive toxicity noted at the DL1 . There will be no intra -patient dose escalation. In the phase II part of the study, we will use the optimal dose identified in p hase I and will aim to recruit a total of 27 patients per a Simon’s 2 stage design, using a type I error rate of 0.05, power of 0.8, r esponse probability of poor drug 0.05, and response probability of good drug 0.2. The first stage sample size will be 13 and if we do not reach the pre -specified requirement of at least one response (complete remission [CR] or partial response [PR] for AML or CR or PR or hematologic improvement [HI] for MDS), the trial will be aborted. After induction, all patients who do not experience significant toxicity or disease progression will continue on a consolidation/ maintenance phase of the study in w hich 4 ad ditional 28 - day cycles of IRX5183 will be administered . This phase will use the same dose used in the induction phase for each individual patient. Patients achieving CR after consolidation/ maintenance will enter an observation phase, with a chance to re -enter the study at relapse, and patients with a PR, HI, or stable disease (SD) after consolidation/ maintenance will be able to remain on study for extended maintenance for an additional year. Select patients may be eligible to continue beyond this point per the discretion of Io Therapeutics and the principal investigator (PI)."

OBJECTIVES HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that the administration of IRX5183 to patients with relapsed/refracto ry acute myeloid leukemia (R/R -AML ) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR -MDS) will be well tolerated and share a similar toxicity profile of adverse events (AEs) to all -trans retinoic acid (ATRA) . We hypothesize that the n et clinical effect of IRX5183 adminis tration in patients with R/R -AML and HR -MDS will be a measurable improvemen t in hematologic parameters and /or a reduction in bone marrow (BM) blast numbers. We predict that IRX5183 administration and consequent differentiation and apoptosis of leukemia cells will lead to measurable la boratory parameters of differentiation and these will correlate with clinical responses and toxic events. 1.1. PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: 1.1.1. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of IRX5183 in patients with R/R -AML and HR -MDS and determine the recommended phase 2 dose (R P2D). 1.1.2. To obtain preliminary efficacy data of IRX5183 in patients with R/R -AML and HR -MDS after at least 2 cycles of therapy at the RP2D . 1.2. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: 1.2.1. To determine pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of IRX5183 and assess bioactivity thr ough pharmacodynamics (PD) studies. 1.2.2. To measure clinical activity of IRX5183 as defined by best International Working Group (IWG) response at any time, time to response, improvement in transfusion requirements, cytopenias, quality of life assessment s, event -free survival ( EFS), and overall survival (OS) and to d etermine the toxicity profile of IRX5183 at the optimal dose. 2. BACKGROUND 2.1. Acute myeloid leukemia : Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) describes a group of heterogeneous disorders charact erized by malignant transformation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) involving both maturation and apoptotic defects leading to an overabundance of immature myeloid cells and suppression of normal hematopoiesis . Although AML affects people of all ages, t he median age at diagnosis is 67 years of age and is most frequently diagnosed (22.9% of new cases) between the ages of 75 and 84. AML is more common in whites (3.4 to 5 per 100,000 females and males, respectively) (Howlader N, 2015) . Biologically, AML is a heterogeneous array of disorders and can arise de novo or secondarily as a consequence of exposure to environmental toxins such as benzene, ionizing ra diation, or previous chemotherapy (topoisomerase II inhibitors or alkylating agents). Although the complexities of genetic abnormalities resulting in AML are yet to be fully characterized, it is well established that abnormal expression of oncogenes and t umor suppressor control within a pluripotent stem cells lead to abnormal myeloid maturation and resistance to apoptosis (Godwin & Smith, 2003) . Prognosis is dependent on a number of factors including age at diagnosis, specific cytogenetic abnormalities, white blood cell count at time of presentati on, previous chemotherapy or exposure to toxins, and previous hematologic problems. Cytogenetic abnormalities such as inversion 16, t(8;21) and t(15;17) are associated with a good prognosis while abnormalities involving loss of 5 or 7, partial deletions of 5 or 7,"
7,page_7,"Sponsor: Io Therapeutics, Inc. J15219 (IRB00083855) Version date: September 8, 2017 Io Page 8 of 66 and complex cytogenetics are associated with a poor prognosis. Characteristic cytogenetic abnormalities are seen in treatment -related AML with unbalanced translocations or deletions of 5 and 7 seen with alkylating agent exposure and balanced trans locations involving the 11q23 MLL gene with topoisomerase II inhibitor exposure. In addition, AML associated with myelodysplasi a is associated with a poor prognosis. Conventional Frontline Treatment : Standard chemotherapy in younger patients with a go od performance status involves induction chemotherapy using cytarabine an d an anthracycline, either dauno rubicin or idarubicin, and can yield a complete remission (CR) rate of 60 -70%. Consolidation chemotherapy is then required to remove any microscopic di sease (Hiddemann et al., 2005) . Despite remission after induction and consolidation chemotherapy, the risk of recurrence is approximately 50 -60% (Schumacher, Alvares, Blough, & Mazzella, 2002) . Patients who are poorer risk in terms of cytogenetic abnormalities or age may be offered other treatment modalitie s. For patient s who are older or are not able to tolerate intensification of therapy to bone marrow transplant, other drug modalities may be employed including but not limited to more biologically targeted agents such as FLT -3 inhibitors, immunomodulatory therapies , DNA methyltra nsferase inhibitors, farnesyltransferase inhibitors, etc (Norsworthy, Luznik, & Gojo, 2012) . For those patients who are higher risk disease and are younger with a good performance status, proceeding with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in CR1 or in CR2 is an option. Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplant : Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is a treatment modality considered to be a possible curative option for patients with AML. It is typically reserved for patients with intermediate to high risk AML and those whose ag e and performance status permit the increased intensity of the treatment. According to the Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplant Research ( CIBMTR) data, outcomes for an HLA -matched sibling transpl ant for adult patients 20 years or older in CR1 showed 58% survival at 3 years and in CR2 a 50% survival at 3 years. For a matched -unrelated donor transplant survival ou tcomes were slightly lower at 49% in CR1 and 47% in CR2 at 3 years (Pasquini MC, 2014) . In recent years, the development of approaches to limit graft -versus host disease in half -matched donors have allowed for tr ansplantation of HLA haplo -identical bone marrow with similar outcomes (McCurdy et al., 2015) . Limitations of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation include co -morbidities , performance status, treatment -related com plications including graft versus host disease and infectious complications. Because of these limitations, transplantation is not an option for everyone and alternative treatment strategies need to be investigated. Conventional salvage/relapse therapy : Relapse is unfortunately a far too common occurrence for AML patients and there is no one standard of care. Multiple regimens have been studied, but popular ones include MEC (mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine), HAM (high -dose cytarabine and mitoxantr one), CLAG -M (cladribine, cytarabine, G -CSF, and mitoxantrone), and FLAG -ida (fludarabine, cytarabine, G -CSF, and idarubicin). Response rates can be as high as 40 -60% in patients with prolonged first remissions beyond 1 year. However, in patients with shorter CR durations, response rates are dismal at approximately 10 -15%, with the exception of core - binding factor AML or CEBPA double mutants (Thol, Schlenk, Heuser, & Ganser, 2015) . In addition, many patients in the relapsed and refractory setting are not fit for administration of these chemotherapeutic regimens. Studies looking at hypomethylating agents in the relapsed and refrac tory setting have shown overall response rates of 15 -20% (Itzykson et al., 2015; Ritchie et al., 2013) with overall survival of about"
8,page_8,"Sponsor: Io Therapeutics, Inc. J15219 (IRB00083855) Version date: September 8, 2017 Io Page 9 of 66 6-8 months; poor risk cytogenetics and high peripheral blast count predicted for poor response. Given these unfavorable response rates, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommendations are for a clinical trial in this setting. 2.2. Myelodysplastic syndrome : Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a complex and heteroge neous group of disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis manifest by cytopenias, dysplasia, and increased risk of infection. In the general population the incidence is approximately 5 cases per 100,000 people; however, as age increases the incidence rises to approximately 50 cases per 100,000 people age over 70 (Howlader N, 2015) . Complete understanding of the pathophysiology of MDS is yet to be e lucidated. However, it is generally accepted that there is an initial genetic event within a pluripotent progenitor cell followed by a sequence of inflammation with increased release of cytokines such as TNF -alpha and Interferon -gamma. This all occurs in the setting of an initial pro -apoptotic and proliferative state lending some explanation to the typically seen hypercellular marrow with peripheral cytopenias. Prognosis is predicted by cytogenetics, number of cytopenias, and blast percentage and is calcu lated by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and revised IPSS (IPSS -R) (Appendix B ). Conventional Treatment of MDS : There are four major generalizable goals of medical treatment: 1) Control the symptoms caused by cytopenias; 2) Decrease p rogression to AML; 3) Improve overall survival; 4) Im prove overall quality of life (Cheson et al., 2006) . For those individuals of advanced age or poor performance status options are limited to supportive care in the form of transfusions, growth factor support with erythropoietin or G -CSF, and prophylactic antibiotics (Blinder & Roboz, 2003) . For those individuals of younger age and good performance status treatment is more aggressive and focused on cure with hematopoietic stem cell transplant the only current option (Benesch & Deeg, 2003) . Patients who are eligible for curative allogeneic tr ansplant will not be candidates for this trial. Supportive Care : Due to the usual advanced age of patients at presentation, poor performance status, or low risk disease, supportive care in the form of transfusions, prophylactic antibiotics, and growth factor support are sometimes the only option for treatment. Erythropoietin has been used in MDS patients with significant anemia; however, the responders are typically those patients who are already transfusion independent and only yield a hematologic response of approximately 16%. In combination with G -CSF, the response rate can be inc reased to approximately 36 -40% (Stein, 2003) . G-CSF is only recommended in situations of repeated neutropenic fevers or infections or in combina tion with Erythropoietin support. Due to significant costs and low response rate in transfusion -dependent patients, long -term erythropoietin is not of overall long-term benefit. Differentiation/Epigenetic Modification Agents : DNA methylation and histone acetylation are two areas of intense investigation in epigenetic modulation for MDS treatment. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors, such as 5 - azacytidine, are now approved for use in high risk MDS patients and yield an overall response rate of appr oximately 40-63% (Silverman, 2004) . These drugs lead to demethylation by incorporating into DNA as nucleoside analogues and subsequently"

J15219 (IRB00083855) Version date: September 8, 2017 Io Page 10 of 66 inhibiting the methy ltransferase activity, a process which appears to b e both dose and time -dependent (Kizaki & Koeffler , 1992) . Histone acetylation and deacetylation also play a significant role in expression of DNA and process is being targeted in investigational MDS therapy. The intricacies of histone deacetylase inhibition are beyond the scope of this background intro duction but in brief involve multiple genes affecting differentiation (p21), cell cycle (p21/p27/ upregulation of Cyclin A, and D/CDK4 downregulati on), and apoptosis alterations (Bhalla, 2005) . Immune The rapy: Many studies have substantiated the role of the T cell activity in MDS pathogenesis. Anti T -cell therapies have been evaluated by multiple investigators and include such agents as ATG and cyclosporine serving as immunosuppression in patients with M DS (Jonasova et al., 1998; Molldrem et al., 1997) . Additionally, the basis for the graft versus leukemia/MDS effect in allogeneic bone marrow transplant lends weight to the argument for immune system involvement in the pathogenesis of MDS as allogeneic bone marrow transplant is the only current curative regimen for MDS. The role of other methods of immune modulation has been ill ustrated with trials involving t halidomide and lenalidomide. Thalidomide has been show n to cause a shift of T cell response from a Th1 to a Th2 response and inhibit producti on and secretion of TNF alpha (Candoni et al., 2004) . A 2001 study showed that thalidomide was effective at improving cytopenias in certain MDS p atients (Raza et al., 2001) . Lena lidomide, a thalidomide analogue with few er side effects , was also shown to have a hematologic response (Catenacci & Schille r, 2005) . These studies, and multiple others, have been done and substantiate the immune modulatory effects of these agents on patients with MDS. Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation : Allogeneic bone marrow transplant is the only curative treatment o ption for patients with MDS. The European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation ( EBMT ) reported a 36% disease free survival and a 37% non -relapse mortality at 3 years in a group of 885 patients receiving allogeneic sibling transplants for MDS (de Witte et al., 2000) . The same group later reported similar data for unrelated peripheral blood and cord blood transplants (Robin et al., 2015) . The CIBMTR reporte d a 3-year p robability of survival of 53% and 49% for recipients of sibling and unrelated donor transplan ts for early MDS, respectively, and a mong patients with advanced MDS, probabilities were 45% and 39% (Pasquini MC, 2014) . Overall, transplant data shows that patients with low level of disease have a better outcome with transp lant (Sierra et al., 2002) . In recent years, with the development of post -transplant cyclophosphamide, haplo -identical transplants have been an excellent option for patients with MDS without a matched sibling donor, with one seri es showing PFS of 41% for patients with MDS and AML (Di Stasi et al., 2014) . Many factors limit the use of transplant. The majority of patients with MDS are older than 60 and often have a poor performance status. Furthermore, t here is significant potential for treatment related morbidity and mortality. Because MDS is a heterogeneous population of disease with a wide spectrum of clinical severity where the sole current curative measure of transplantation carries wit h it significant risk, other options for treatment are in high demand. Treatment of refractory disease :"

J15219 (IRB00083855) Version date: September 8, 2017 Io Page 11 of 66 Patients with MDS unfortunately have dismal outcomes after failure of demethylating agent therapy. One series of 435 patients with high -risk MDS and former refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB -T) after azacitidine treatment failure had an overall survival of only 5.6 months and 2-year survival of 15%. In this study, outcomes were improved when patients received allogen eic stem cell transplant or an investigational therapy (Prebet et al., 2011) . Furthermore, a small retrospective analysis showed that treatm ent with decitabine post -azaciti dine failure in patients with MDS or AML resulted in stable disease (SD) in only 20 % of patients , with no CRs or PRs, and OS was 5.9 months (Duong et al., 2015) . Per these observations and lack of other approved therapies, NCCN guidelines dictate that clinical trials or best supportive care are the best and only options for these patients. 2.3. Previous C ell Differentiation Therapies in Myeloid Malignancies : Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a prime example of success with the differentiation therapy all - trans retinoic acid (ATRA). A characteristic ge netic finding in APL, the PML /RARA fusion protein, likely mediates the ability of ATRA to induce differentiation of leukemic blasts. However, it is unlikely that APL is unique among neoplastic diseases in its responsiveness to differentiation therapy. With standard induction chemotherapy and observation in patients with APL, the disease free survival at 5 years was less than 20% compared to greater than 70% DFS with ATRA induction and maintenance (Tallman et al., 2002) . Thus, ATRA has become the standard of care for treatment of APL. In recent years, we have been able to completely eliminate conventional chemotherapy from the treatment of low -risk APL with the combination of ATRA and arsenic. Lo -Coco et al showed that this therapy was non -inferior to ATRA - chemot herapy, and perhaps even superior with EFS of 97% at 2 years with ATRA -arsenic versus 86% with ATRA -chemotherapy (Lo-Coco et al., 2013) . Unfortunately, ATRA has had limited success in non-APL AML (Burnett et al., 2010; Burnett et al., 2007; Estey et al., 1999; Milligan et al., 2006; Schlenk et al., 2004) ; similarly, other differentiating agents have failed to make a major clinical impact for unclear reasons. A second example of effective differentiation therapy is the use of myeloid growth factors, namely GM - CSF, in the differentiation of the earliest progenitors of CML. During normal hematopoiesis, homeostasis is maintained by the balance between self -renewa l and differenti ation; however, specific genetic changes within tumor cells may lead to the preferential enhancement of proliferation or survival by growth factors and result in clonal expansion. Previous laboratory studies have demonstrated that p210 expression in CML increases myeloid cell survival by inhibition of apoptosis (Bedi et al., 1993) . Previous clinical studies have explore d the role of myeloid growth factors in eradication of CML via differentiation. One phase II tri al performed prior to the approval of imatinib showed that interferon in combination with GM -CSF resulted in cure in a small proportion of patients with CML (Zeidner et al., 2014) . Another study utilized GM -CSF in the setting of autologous BMT in patients with CML (Gladstone et al., 1999) . Autologous bone marrow grafts were treated in vitro with GM -CSF and growth factor was administered to patients following grafting. All pa tients engrafted Ph - indicating that in vitro graft treatment preferentially expanded normal hematopoietic progenitors. Extensive in vitro and in vivo investigations have shown that combining growth factors with differentiating agents can enhance the anti -leukemic activity. GM -CSF enhances the differentiation activity of various agents such as interferon -alpha, ATRA, arsenic trioxide, and bryostatin (Angstreich et al., 2005; W. Matsui et al., 2005; W. H. Matsui et a l., 2002; Smith et al., 2011; Zeidner et al., 2014) . For example, bryostatin -1 acts as a partial agonist of protein kinase C (PKC), and previous studies found that it inhibited the clonogenic growth of AML cell lines by inducing cell cycle arrest and dif ferentiation (Berkow & Kraft,"
11,page_11,"Sponsor: Io Therapeutics, Inc. J15219 (IRB00083855) Version date: September 8, 2017 Io Page 12 of 66 1985; Grant, Pettit, Howe, & McCrady, 1991; Vrana, Saunders, Chellappan, & Grant, 1998) . Our group found that the addition of myeloid growth factors markedly enhanced leukemic differen tiation, and neutralizing antibodies directed against myeloid growth factors blocked the differentiating potential of bryostatin -1, suggesting that growth factors were necessary for its full anti -leukemic activity (W. Matsui et al., 2005; W. H. Matsui et al., 2002) . We studied the combination of bryostatin and GM -CSF in a phase I trial in poor -risk myeloid malignancies (Smith et al., 2011) . The combination improved neutrophi l counts and led to rare clinical responses, but severe myalgias and arthralgias limited dose escalation. Our group also showed that GM -CSF substantially increases the differentiation potential of the synthetic retinoid bexarotene and the HDAC inhibitor e ntinostat (formerlyMS -275), in leukemia cell lines, as measured by increased expression of differentiation markers by flow cytometry and decreased clonogenic growth (Eunpi et al., 2010) . Our group previously conducted two companion phase II trials investigating dual differentiation and growth factor therapy in patients with high -risk MDS or relapsed/refractory AML by co mbining GM -CSF with agents known to differentiate AML in vitro but with different mechanisms of action: bexarotene (BEX), a retinoid, and entinostat (ENT), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (Eunpi et al., 2010; Norsworthy KJ, 2015) . 26 patients received BEX + GM -CSF and 24 patients received ENT + GM -CSF. Of the 13 patients treated with BEX who completed 2 or more cycles, 5 patients had hem atologic improvement (HI) for an overall response rate (ORR) of 38%, and 3 had SD . Of the 10 patients treated with ENT who completed 2 or more cycles, 1 patient had a partial response (PR) and 5 had HI for an ORR of 60% and 1 had SD. Both combinations sh owed a trend in improved neutrophil count with near doublin g of mean ANC for BEX and a near four-fold expansion in the ENT study without increase in peripheral blast counts in either group. The drugs were well tolerated with similar toxicity profiles. Ne ither agent resulted in CRs in the poor -risk cohorts studied, but many had HI or stabilization of disease, supporting the impact of the combination strategy on differentiation. 2.4. Impact of bone marrow microenvironment on sensitivity to retinoids : APL and most non -APL AMLs undergo terminal differentiation and elimination by ATRA in vitro . However , as mentioned above, ATRA has not proven effective in non -APL AML in randomized clinical trials to date (Burnett e t al., 2010; Burnett et al., 2007; Estey et al., 1999; Milligan et al., 2006) . Retinoic acid (RA) plays a significant role in the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) . Recent data from our group show that the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP26 e xpressed in bone marrow (BM) stromal cells inactivates RA, thereby limiting differentiation of HSCs (Ghiaur et al., 2013) . We have also shown that several APL and non -APL AML cell lines are sensitive to RA -induced differentiation and elimination in vitro , but this was prevented in the presence of BM stroma; a ddition of the CYP 26 inhibitor R115866 reversed stroma -induced resistance to RA (Su et al., 2015) . Use of R115866 in a clinical trial is not possible due to lac k of availability. A secon d strategy is to use a retinoid resistant to metabolism by CYP26. IRX5183 and AM80 are synthe tic retinoids resistant to CYP26 metabo lism, 10 times more potent than ATRA as in vitro inducer s of differentiation in APL cells, and have been studied clinically to treat APL and other malignancies (Osanai & Petkovich, 2005; Sanford D, 2014) . IRX5183 i s more selective for retinoic acid receptor alpha than AM80, potentially leading to a milder side effect profile. Preliminary clinical experience with IRX5183 in a phase I/II study in solid tumor patients showed the drug was well tolerated without any ser ious adverse events; it has also been used in a few patients with newly diagnosed APL (company data). D ata from our laboratory show that both AM80 and IRX5183 are resistant to stroma -mediated inactivation, similar to the"

IRX5183 : IRX5183 is a synthetic retinoid produced by Io Therapeutics, Inc. that specifically targets retinoic acid receptor alpha ( RARα ). Understanding of the function of the retinoid family of receptors is crucial for comprehension of the functi on of IRX5183 in treatment of AML . Although an extensive review is beyond the scope of this protocol background, the general principles in retinoid acid receptors are discussed below. In general, retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RX Rs) are ligand -dependent transcription factors that are a part of the steroid/thyroid family. RARs play an important role in the differentiation and growth regulation of many adult tissues, especially hematopoiesis , with 6 different domains involved in con stitutional transcript activation, DNA binding, ligand binding, dimerization, and ligand -induced transcriptional activation (Morosetti et al., 1996) . Metabolites of Vitamin A bind to the RARs but do not bind to the RXRs. The RARs and RXRs have inte grated function and alter gene transcription based on their dimerization eithe r as homodimers or heterodimers (Morosetti et al., 1996) . An example of the interaction between the RA Rs and RXRs and treatment with retinoids that bind the RARs is seen with all -trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for acute promyelocytic leukemia. The overwhelming success of ATRA inducing terminal differentiation of blasts in APL is an example of use of agents tha t affect the RARs and RXRs that is now the standard of care for treatment of APL. ATRA is known to target RAR α, β, and γ at pharmacologic concentrations, but only RARα and γ are expressed in immature and maturing hematopoietic cells. Preclinical studies by Chee et al suggested that ATRA enhances hematopoietic stem cell self -renewal through RAR γ, while promoting differentiation of committed myeloid progenitors through RAR α activation (Chee, Hendy, Purton, & McArthur, 2013) . They found that IRX5183 decreased clonogenicity and increased mature myeloid mar kers by flow in AML1 - ETO -expressing murine BM progenitors in vitro , whereas ATRA had the opposite effect (potentiation of clonogenicity and immature myeloid phenotype by flow), suggesting the efficacy of a RAR α specific agent in non -APL AML. In addition to being a pan -RAR agonist, ATRA is known to induce CYP26 expression, which l ikely impacts its bioactivity (Ozpolat, Mehta, Tari, & Lopez -Berestein, 2002) . In contrast, metabolism studies in liver microsomes from multiple species, including human, indicate that IRX5183 is not subject to oxidative metabolism (Investigator’s Brochure, 2008). Unlike other retinoids with pan RAR activity, IRX5183 did not induce dermal irrit ation in a mouse model. However, it does retain the hypertriglyceridemic effect of other retinoids. A receptor -specific retinoid such as IRX5183 may induce fewer adverse effects when compared to a receptor -non-specific retinoid such as ATRA, while retain ing the modulation activity of the cell cycle. The clinical use of ATRA has been complicated by the development of ATRA resistance due to pharmacokinetic reasons. Chronic oral ATRA therapy in APL patients results in progressively lower blood levels of AT RA presumably because of autoinduction of metabolism (Adamson, 1996) . In contrast, structural features incorporated into the IRX5183 molecule have been designed to make the compound resis tant to this degradative catabolism. Full pharmacokinetic evaluation in rats demonstrates that, for the most part, maximal concentrations (Cmax) and area-under -the-curve (AUC) values are not changed between days 8 and 30 at any of the doses tested. Simil ar evaluations in dogs show that IRX5183 Cmax and AUC values are unchanged between days 7 and 28. This pharmacokinetic profile observed in rats and dogs appears to be retained in humans, where Cmax and AUC values on day 14 were increased relative to day 0 after the first dose ( Investigator’s Brochure, 2008 ). Therefore, persistently high blood drug levels should be obtained upon chronic oral dosing with IRX5183."
13,page_13,"Sponsor: Io Therapeutics, Inc. J15219 (IRB00083855) Version date: September 8, 2017 Io Page 14 of 66 IRX5183 was studied in an animal model of t(8;21) AML1 -ETO, where fet al liver cells were tran sfected and transduced with AML1 -ETO9a plasmids and transplanted into irradiated Ptprca mice (Chee et al., 2013) . The mice developed leukemia by 5 weeks post -transplant. IRX5183 or DMSO was given orally at 45 mg/kg da ily six days per week for four weeks. The IRX5183 treated mice had significantly lower total white blood cell counts , peripheral blood blasts, and green fluorescent protein positive cells two weeks after completion of treatment. In addition, they had sig nificantly more maturing intermediate myeloid cells and neutrophils. There was no effect on survival of the mice, but treatment ceased after only four weeks of therapy; after drug withdrawal, the blast cell population expanded and ultimately led to death from leukemia. IRX5 183 has been used in humans in two separate studies. The first was a single -center, phase I trial evaluating the safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and pharmacokinetics of IRX5183 administered daily for a minimum of 4 weeks, perfor med in patients with refractory malignancies. The starting dose was 60 mg/m2/day as a single daily dose in the morning based on pre -clinical data. A total of 15 patients were accrued, and 12 completed at least one 4 -week cycle of therapy. Due to dose -limiting toxicities (DLTs), the dose was reduced to 30 and then 15 mg/m2, with 15 mg/m2 determined to be the MTD. 3 of 4 DLTs were elevated alkaline phosphatase (all in patients with liver metastases and 2 had elevated alkaline phosphatase at baseline). The 4th DLT was grade 3 mucosal inflammation. 10 patients came off study because of progressive disease (PD) and no antitumor activity was observed. The drug was absorbed rapidly and reached peak concentrations approximately 1 to 3 hours following dosing. The terminal elimination half - life ranged from 3.3 to 16.1 hours on the first day of dosing. Based on persistently high drug levels, stable anti-proliferative, pro -differentiation and anti -apoptotic effects could be expected with oral IRX5183. The secon d trial evaluating IRX5183 in humans was a randomized, open label, single center phase I/II trial studying peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) mobilization in combination with G -CSF, with intra- patient con trol and an additional control arm of two mobil izations with G -CSF alone , after high dose chemotherapy in patients with multiple myeloma and lymphoma. For the intra -patient control, each patient underwent 2 mobilizations and mobilization variables were compared between each episode. IRX5183 was given at a dose of 60 mg/m2 daily and G -CSF was given at a dose of 10mcg/kg daily. 8 patients were accrued to the study and patients were administered IRX5183 60 mg/m2 daily for up to 28 days. No serious adverse events associated with IRX5183 were reported an d no DLT was observed. The conclusion from the study was that IRX5183 and G -CSF in combination was unlikely to benefit poor progenitor cell mobilizers, but it may benefit good mobilizers, particularly if pretreated prior to a second mobilization with G-CSF alone. Preclinical studies at Johns Hopkins : Precl inical studies were conducted in the labs of Gabriel Ghiaur and Richard Jones at Johns Hopkins Oncology Center. Leukemia cell lines NB4 (an APL cell line with t( 15;17)), OCI -AML3 (an AML cell l ine with NPM1 mut ation), and Kasumi -1 (AML cell line with t(8;21)) were used in the experiments. Cells were incubated with control media vs. equal concentrations of ATRA or IRX5183 in the presence and absence of BM stroma . Differentiation was assessed vi a flow analysis for marker CD11b and c lonogenic growth was assessed using a colony forming unit assay. ATRA and IRX5183 showed similar increased differentiation and inhibition of clonogenic recovery compared to control in liquid culture, but in the presen ce of BM stroma, only IRX re tained its efficacy (Figure 1, unpublished data ). Therefore, IRX5183 is resistant to inactivation by stromal CYP26."

Colony forming unit (CFU) experiments with (A) OCI -AML3 and (B) NB4 cells treated with ATRA or IRX5183 at doses of 10-6 and 10-7M for the different cell types , respectively , showed a decrease in clonogenic grow th compared to control with IRX5183 both off and on stroma. We additionally incubated NB4 cells with CD437 , a RAR γ specific agent that is also resistant to metabolism by CYP26, and this resulted in a complete lack of increase in differentiation markers compared to control and no decrease in clonogenic recovery. Therefore, targeting RAR γ had no impact on cellular differentiation . qRT-PCR experiments showed that IRX5183 had minimal impact on CYP26 expression in OP-9 stromal cells, unlike ATRA an d CD437, suggesting the impact of RAR γ in the marrow microenvironment is induction of CYP26, while targeting of RARα leads to myeloid differentiation. Moreover, IRX5183 is a RARα specific agent that is able to bypass me tabolism by CYP26 in BM stroma. The demonstrated preclinical data in combination with the successful use of retinoids in APL provides the foundation for the proposed trial. 2.6. Rationale : We postulate that , to date, retinoids have not been proven effective in the treatment of non -APL AML due to stromal protection by CYP26. Our lab has published recently that this mechanism of stromal resistance to cancer therapies is not limited to ATRA. There are a multitude of li ver enzymes present in the BM stroma, including CYP3A4, which metabolize s BEX and etoposide, among many other agents, and cytidine deaminase, which metabolizes cytarabine (Alonso et al., 2015) . BEX + GM -CSF previously showed some differentiating ability in our phase II trial, but may have not been fully effective due to high CYP3A4 expression. IRX5183 is a novel retinoi d, which as a single agent bypasses this mechanism of protection afforded leukemia cells in the BM microenvironment. In addition, its RAR α specificity is attractive as RAR γ does not appear to have an effect on differentiation and may lead to additional side effects. The preclinical data with IRX5183 inducing differentiation in leukemia cell lines and the prior in vivo mouse model give supp ort for p roceeding with a trial of single agent IRX5183 in AML and HR -MDS . In addition, the oral bioavailability, and good tolerance of IRX5183 in solid tumor patients previously make it an attractive agent to study. Given that the phase I trial was in s olid tumor patients previously, many with underlying liver dysfunction, we would like to perform a phase I/II trial in order to establish the safety and toxicity profile in patients with AML and MDS . Although there is no current data for the use of IRX518 3 in myeloid malignancies to describe the baseline response we expect to see OCI -AML3 cells NB4 cells n=3 n=3"

TREATMENT PLAN 5.1. IRX5183 Administration : IRX5183 is an oral capsule that will be administered once daily . Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in Sectio n 9. Appropriate dose modifications are described in Section 6 . No investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those described below may be administered with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy. Patients will be instructed to t ake the daily dose of IRX5183 each morning after food, as close to the same time as possible. IRX5183 will be self - admini stered at home, except for days 1 and 14 of cycle 1, on which patients will receive their doses in clinic after trough PK levels are d rawn . Each patient will keep a pill diary to help with compliance. If a patient forgets to take a dose in the morning and it is before 8:00 p.m., they should be instructed to take their dose. If the subject forgets to take their daily dose and it is aft er 8:00 p.m., they should be instructed to wait for the next morning to dose. If vomiting occurs after dosing, the subject should not receive another dose, but instead wait until the next morning to dose. The schedule of IRX5183 administration and the do se escalation schema are shown in figure 2 and table 1, respectively . At any point, patients will be withdrawn from treatment for undue toxicity, disease progression, and/or deterioration of performance status, per guidelines in section 3.5 above . For induction therapy , single agent IRX5183 will be administered orally once daily for two 28 -day cycles. Bone marrow assessments will be performed after each cycle, but the primary assessment/endpoint is after cycle 2 of induction. IRX5183 may be held for 5 -7 days post induction therapy to allow for study drug wash -out if the PI has concerns that the drug is limiting the interpretation of the assessment marrow testing needed to measure response . All study patients who have drug held only for marrow assessment are eligible to resume study drug following the completion of the marrow testing , while awaiting final pathology review and response assessment. Patients achiev ing at least SD , i.e. CR , partial remission (PR), hematologic impro vement (HI), or SD ,"
19,page_19,"Sponsor: Io Therapeutics, Inc. J15219 (IRB00083855) Version date: September 8, 2017 Io Page 20 of 66 will be eligible to continue the study treatment planned consolidation/maintenance therapy , which will consist of up to four continuous 4 week (28 day) cycles using the same dose of IRX5183 used in the induction phas e for each individual patient. This will be re ferred to as consolidation therapy if the patient achieves CR after induction, and will be referred to as maintenanc e if the patient achieves a PR, HI, or SD. Consolidation /maintenance therapy may be initiated following the completion of marrow assessment and no longer than 14 days after completion of induction therapy provided there is no evidence of PD . BM testing will be performed after every other cycle in the consolidation/maintenance phase of therapy. IRX5183 may be held for 5 -7 days post each cycl e of consolidation/maintenance where a BM assessment will be performed if the PI has concerns that the drug is limiting the interpretation of the assessment marrows . The next cycle of therapy may begin anytime the assessment marrows are completed and no l onger than 14 days from the completion of the previous cycle provided there is no clinical evidence of PD. If the patient is in a CR after 4 cycles of consolidation/maintenance, IRX5183 will be withdrawn and the patient will enter observation with biwee kly counts for the first month, then monthly for at least 6 months, and bimonthly bone marrow assessments for at least 6 months. If their disease relapses, they will be eligible to re -initiate therapy daily in continuous 4 week cycles. If the patient a chieves at least SD, but not a CR, after 4 cycles of consolidation/maintenance, they will continue on extended maintenance therapy , receiving continuous 4 -week cycles of daily IRX5183 for up to an additional year. Bone marrow assessments will be required at least every 4 months while the patient is on this extended maintenance phase of therapy. Drug may be held 5 -7 days post each cycle of extended maintenance where a BM assessment will be performed if the PI has concerns that the drug is limiting the inte rpretation of the assessment marrows . The next cycle of therapy will be initiated following the completed marrow testing and no longer than 14 days after completion of the prior cycle provided there is no evidence of PD . If any patient remains with at l east SD after the 1 year of extended maintenance therapy, with no undue toxicity and in good condition, they may be eligible for extended therapy indefinitely , per discretion of Io Therapeutics and the Principle Investigator. These patients will continue with bone marrow assessments at least every 6 months and blood counts as clinically indicated. Study Phase I : In the dose -escalation part of the study, we will abide by a traditional 3+3 design with 3 dose levels ( dose level 1 [DL1] with 50 mg IRX5183 , DL2 with 75 mg, and DL3 with 100 mg ), with 1 additional dose level , DL( -1), to be only used if excessive toxicity is noted at the DL1. There will be no intra -patient dose escalation. The first p atient will enter the trial on DL1. The dose for level 1 will be a flat dose of 50 mg IRX5183 daily per the schedule above . We will enroll 3 patients at a time to determine the toxicity profil e of IRX5183 . If none of the 3 patients receiving DL1 experiences a DLT, another 3 patients will be treated at the next higher dose level. However, if 1 of the first 3 patients experiences a DLT, 3 more patients will be treated at the same dose level. The dose escalation will continue until at least 2 patients among a cohort of 3 to 6 patients experience s DLTs. If 2 or more patients experience a DLT on DL1, the next patient will be recruited to DL( -1). The RP2D of single agent IRX5183 will generally be the highest dose at which the DLT rate is <33% in at least six patients. If no MTD is determined, the highest dose"
20,page_20,"Sponsor: Io Therapeutics, Inc. J15219 (IRB00083855) Version date: September 8, 2017 Io Page 21 of 66 explored will be 100 mg. At the end of phase I, the RP2D will be determined after careful review of all of the clinical data available . The first 3 subjects enrolled to any cohort must have passed the 28 day DLT evaluation point before the 4th subject will be gin treatment. IRX5183 will be initiated at the company’s currently recommended dosage for use in APL patients of 50 mg daily (about 30 mg/m2/day). The drug is available in 25 mg capsules, so we will be using a flat dosage. This dose of 50 mg is above t he MTD of 15 mg/m2/day from the prior phase I trial conducted in solid tumor patients. However, the DLTs seen in this trial were elevations in alkaline phosphatase in patients with known liver metastases. In addition, the phase I/II trial in patients wit h myeloma and lymphoma used a dose of 60 mg/m2, which was well tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs). The roughly 2 months of induction therapy followed by consolidation/maintenance described above is modeled after prior studies of ATRA and othe r synthetic retinoids, in which it can take up to 60 days to see an initial response (Lo-Coco et al., 2013; Sanford D, 2014; Tobita et al., 1997) . Study Ph ase II : The phase II part of the study will use the opti mal dose identified in the phase I part of the study and will aim to recruit a total of 27 patients with AML and HR -MDS at the RP2D (see sample size calculation in section 11). The primary goal of the therapy in this phase of the trial is to determine resp onse after receiving at least 2 cycles of therapy per IWG criteria. Analysis of clinical response will take place after the first 13 patients complete induction therapy, and enrollment will continue to the planned 27 patients if the first stage has at lea st 1 patient achieve a CR or CRi or PR (AML) or CR or PR or HI (MDS). We will halt enrollment after the first 13 patients complete induction therapy until we have their response data. In addition to IWG response, many secondary endpoints will be assessed as outlined in section 11 below. Figure 2 : IRX5183 Administration Schema. Induction phase will consist of 56 days of oral IRX5183 daily. Consolidation/maintenance phase will begin once patient has confirmed SD or better and will continue for up to four 28-day cycles. If patient is in CR after consolidation/maintenance, will hold therapy and monitor, and resume therapy if they relapse. If they have SD or better after consolidation/maintenance, they will continue on maintenance therapy for up to 1 addition al year. Select patients may be eligible to continue for longer. * Bone marrow assessment ♦ PK collection Table 1: Dose Escalation of oral I RX5183 administration in phase I part of the study. *: DL( -1) will only recruit if the maximally -7-14 1 14 28 56 ~66 122 178 290 ------ 543 Study D ays if PD if PD if PD IRX5183 po qd ay * ♦ *♦ * * * * * * * v Off study Induction Consolidation/Maintenance if CR if relapse Observation Extended Maintenance if CR/PR/HI/SD if PR/HI/SD 4 cy 2 cy 2 cy 2 cy 4 cy 4 cy"

Definition of dose -limiting toxicity : For pu rposes of dose -escalation, dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as the occurrence of any of t he following during the first 28 days of therapy:  Any grade 3 or 4 non -hematologic toxicity with the following exceptions:  Transient laboratory abnormalities that can be treated or resolve to grade 2 or less within 1 week from holding study drug .  Grade 3 -4 non -hematologic toxicities that resolve to  Grade 1 within 1 week of holding study drug  Grade 3 -4 expected and know n drug class -related toxicities associated with differentiation syndrome (see definition below in section 9.2.4) that resolve within 2 week s of steroid therapy to grade 1 will be excluded as DLT for purposes of dose escalation. This is due to the fact that such events are expected of therapy with retinoids that are effectively causing differentiation . If grade 3 or above differentiation syndrome recurs after this time , it will then be considered a DLT.  Asymptoma tic Grade 3 hypertriglyceridemia will not be considered a DLT for purposes of dose escalation .  Grade 4 hematologic toxicity, including only treatment -associated aplasia (to be investigated with a BM test) that persists beyond 4 weeks . Given that severe anemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are features of AML and are commonly encountered in this patient population, they will not be used to define DLT except if associated with prolonged treatment -assoc iated aplasia .  If the bone marrow at the end of cy cle 1 or 2 of therapy is hypoplastic, as defined by less than 5% cellularity, the patient may have a drug -fee window of up to 2 weeks to look for count recovery and treatment will be re -initiated after this time if toxicity returns to  Grade 3 Management and dose modifications associated with the above adverse events are outlined in Section 6. Toxicities will be assessed during the first cycle of therapy and throughout the trial to make sure there are no late adverse effects. If any chronic toxicity be comes apparent, we will evaluate whether changes in trial design are required. Dose escalation will proceed within each cohort according to the following scheme. Table 2: Dose escalation rules. Number of Patients with DLT at a Given Dose Level (DL) Escalation Decision Rule 0 out of 3 in DL1 Enter 3 patients at the next dose level (DL2) . If DL2 the maximally administered dose (MAD), enroll 3 more pts at DL1 and if < 2 of 6 have DLT, DL1 will be the RP2D 1 out of 3 in DL1 Enter 3 additional patients at DL1 and if < 2 of 6 have a DLT,"
23,page_23,"Sponsor: Io Therapeutics, Inc. J15219 (IRB00083855) Version date: September 8, 2017 Io Page 24 of 66 Note: DL( -1) will be only used if maximal ly administered dose reached at DL1. If DL( -1) is use d and DLT occurred in < 2 of 6 patients, then DL(-1) will be used as the recommended phase 2 dose. If ≥ 2 out of 6 patients in DL( -1) have DLT , then the study will be terminated . 5.3. General concomita nt medication and supportive care guidelines : The patients will receive appropriate standard of care supportive measures as per the institutional guidelines of the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer center, including but not limited to blood and platelet transfusions, antibiotics , anti -emetics, etc. Hematopoietic growth factors will not be used routinely. 5.3.1. Differentiation syndrome Patients with suspected evidence of differentiation syndrome, as defined in section 9.2.4 below will be admitt ed to the hospital and immediately started on dexamethasone 10 mg IV twice daily and continued until disappearance of signs and symptoms for a minimum of 3 days. In addition, IRX5183 will be held until resolution of symptoms , at least until improvement to grade 2 or below differentiation syndrome , while on concomitant steroids . As above, grade 3 -4 signs/symptoms of differentiation syndrome that do not return to grade 1 within 2 week s of steroid therapy will be considered a DLT. 5.3.2. Leukocytosis Patie nts who develop leukocytosis on study drug will be administered hydroxyurea at a dose of 500 mg qid for WBC between 20,000 and 50,000/ L and 1 g qid for WBC >50,000/ L. Hydroxyurea may be considered for a WBC between 10,000 and 20,000/ µL on a case by case basis, in consultation with the study PI. Hydroxyurea can be discontinued when WBC returns below 10-20,000/L, per the judgment of the investigator , and must be stopped with WBC <5,000/L. If a consistent need for hydroxyurea persists beyond induction th erapy, the patient will be withdrawn from the protocol. enter 3 patients at the next dose level (DL2) ≥ 2 out of 6 in DL1 Dose escalation will be stopped.

Hypertriglyceridemia Per the FDA drug label for the similar agent Tretinoin, “up to 60% of patients experienced hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia, which were reversible upon co mpletion of treatment. The clinical consequences of temporary elevation of triglycerides and cholesterol are unknown, but venous thrombosis and myocardial infarction have been reported in patients who ordinarily are at low risk for such complications.” In attempt to prevent such complications , patients who develop the known drug -class side effect of hypertrigly ceridemia grade 3 -4 (>500 mg/dL) should be treated with gemfibrozil 600 mg orally twice daily , given 30 minutes before morning and evening meals . IRX 5183 should be held in the setting of grade 4 (>1000 mg/dL) hypertriglyceridemia until resolution to grade 3 or less , while on concomitant gemfibrozil. Lovaza (omega -3-acid) 4 grams orally divided qday to bid with meals may be considered on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the PI. Grade 3 -4 elevations associated with clinical symptoms, such as pancreatitis , will result in permanent discontinuation of IRX5183. 5.4. Duration of therapy : Treatment is planned for 56 days of induction therapy (as a bove) and four 28 -day cycles of consolidation/maintenance in patients with at least SD after induction, with an opportunity to continue on maintenance if patients remain in at least SD after 4 cycles of consolidation/maintenance (see details in section 5.1 above), or until one of the following criteria applies: 1) Disease progression as defined in IWG -2003 (Appendix A1 ) for AML and IWG -2006 for MDS ( Appendix A2 ). 2) Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment or inability of the patient to continue treatment for any other reason. 3) Unacceptable adverse event(s) requiring temporary or permanent stopping of study drug defined in section s 5.2 and 6. 4) Patient decide s to withdraw from the study. 5) General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator. 6) Pregnancy All WOCBP should be instructed to contact the investigator immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) at any time during study participation. Institutional policy and local regulations should determine the frequency of on study pregnancy tests for WOCBP enrolled in the study. The investigator must immediately notify Io Therapeutics in the event of a confirmed pregnancy in a patient participating in the study or partner of the patient ."

Duration of follow -up: Patients will be followed closely throughout the study period and for 6 months after the last dose of IRX5183 or 6 months after they are removed for the presence of any toxicity (early or late). During maintenance: Patients will be followed and seen by a member of the study team at least monthly in person, or by phone when study visits are not required. During the 6 months after the last dose or after removal from study: A ll patients will be evaluated by the study team at least monthly. Evaluations may be done during routine clinic visits in patients followed longitudinally at JH or via phone for those patients followed outside of JH. The study team will note the follow -up in the medical records and source documents will be sought for any change in condition related to the study or study drug. Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event OR for at least 6 months after removal fr om study. T he vast majority of patients with relapsed and refractory AML will not survive past 1 year. Therefore , we expect to capture most events of progression, relapse , or death during the maintenance and follow -up phases of the study. For patients who are still alive at end of follow -up period, we will check social security Death Index every 3 months for 2 more years to obtain death dates for OS calculations. 5.6. Criteria for removal from study : Patients will be removed from study when any of the criteria listed in Section s 3.5, 5.2, and 5.4 applies. The reason for study removal and the date the patient was removed will be documented in the Case Report Form. Some patients may have improvement in their baseline PB counts , including a decrease in peripheral blasts following the start of IRX5183 dosing. It is also possible that peripheral counts will worsen or the number of BM blasts will increase with the initiation of therapy. In some cases, patients will not have had sufficient time to develo p the required amount of differentiation to impact the counts. It is also possible that increases in blasts or other disease parameter s may represent differentiation of leukemia cells in response to IRX5183 . In conventional studies, such changes may be worrisome for PD and lead to the premature discontinuation of study drug . Patients with minor blast increases (defi ned as an increase of < 50% of baseline bone marrow blast count) or worseni ng PB counts prior to week 8 may continue on study provided that they remain stable clinically. Primary t umor assessments will be made using IWG 2003 and IWG 2006 criteria at the co mpletion of induction therapy (Appendix A 1-A3). 6. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS: Patients will be monitored for toxicity during the induction, maintenance, and follow -up parts of the dose expansion phase in a similar fashion of the dose escalation phase (see calendar in"
26,page_26,"Sponsor: Io Therapeutics, Inc. J15219 (IRB00083855) Version date: September 8, 2017 Io Page 27 of 66 section 10) with biweekly evaluations during the first cycle of therapy, weekly for the second cycle, and then every other week during the following 4 cycles, and at least monthly after 6 months . Safety data will be captured using C TCAE criteria (version 4) . Dose delays and off treatment criteria for IRX5183 associated toxicities are provided below : Given that severe neutropenia is a common feature of advanced AML and MDS and very mild fluctuations in absolute neutrophil count can lead to significant percent change from baseline, changes in neutrophil count will not be used to hold therapy. If the patient has a neutrophil count at baseline of 1500 or more and the count drop s to less than 500 at any point during administration, the nurse will notify the physician who will decide on further action at his or her discretion . Intra-patient dose reductions or escalations are not allowed. 6.1. Dose Modifications for IRX5183 : Decisions to hold or discontinue a specific IRX5183 dose will be made on safety criteria. Treatment with IRX5183 will be skipped or discontinued if the subject experiences at least one adverse event, specified below, considered by the investigator to be “possibly,” probably,” or “definitely” related to IRX5183 treatment. Any adverse event that will prompt a skipped dose or discontinuation of IRX5183 must be reported. The investigator should conta ct the study PI to discuss any questions. The following criteria will be used to determine dose skipping, restartin g doses, or discontinuing IRX5183 during the trial: It is necessary to avoid study drug dosing and initiate appropriate evaluation and/or treatment for the following adverse events: Any ≥ grade 3 skin related adverse event regardless of causality. Any ≥ g rade 2 non -skin related adverse event, except for easily correctable laboratory abnormalities that do not reflect underlying organ pathology. Any ≥ grade 3 laboratory abnormality , aside from cytopenias. Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality or intercur rent illness that, in the judgment of the investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with continued dosing. It may be necessary to hold study drug to evaluate Grade 1 events that suggest ongoing or incipient differentiation syndrome, including unexplained fever, dyspnea, renal failure, hypotension, and/or unexplained weight gain until diagnosis is determined. IRX5183 may be restarted if/when the adverse event(s) resolve(s) or returns to baseline or ≤ grade 1 within 2 weeks : If the adverse event has been determined not to be related to IRX5183: If >1 dose is to be skipped or > 1 week delay is expected due to current events not related to the study , the dosing schedule modifications must be discussed with the principal investigator prior to implementation. If the adverse event has resolved to ≤ grade 1, IRX5183 dosing may be restarted where the patient left off in their cycle of therapy ."
27,page_27,"Sponsor: Io Therapeutics, Inc. J15219 (IRB00083855) Version date: September 8, 2017 Io Page 28 of 66 The following criteria will be used to determine dose skipping , restarting doses, or discontinuing IRX5183 during phase II of the trial: Hepatotoxicity: Grade 3 -4 hepatotoxicity according to CTCAE is defined as an increase in serum bilirubin of >3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or alkaline phosphatase (AlkPhos) >5 times the ULN. During the dose expansion phase of the trial, this will be managed with temporary discontinuation and subsequent dose adjustment of IRX5183. As soon as the bilirub in, AST, ALT, and/or AlkPhos returns to Grade 2, IRX5183 will be resumed at less than or equal to 50% of the previous dose (e.g. 25 mg for 50 mg or 75 mg dosing, 50 mg for 100 mg dosing) during the first week. Thereafter, in the absence of worsening previ ous toxicity, IRX5183 will be resumed at full dosing. In the case of reemergence of hepatotoxicity, the drug will be permanently discontinued. These stipulations are based on prior reports that ATRA -induced hepatotoxicity improves with temporary disconti nuation of the drug. Other non -hematologic toxicities: During phase II of the trial, IRX5183 should be dose reduced by 1 dose level for grade 2 non - hematologic toxicity. If the RP2D is DL( -1), this dose will be 25 mg every other day. For grade 3-4 non -hematologic toxicity, therapy will be discontinued until resolution to grade <2 and then restarted at a 2 level dose reduction. If the R P2D is DL( -1), the patient will go to 25 mg every other day since this is the lowest feasible dose. If symptoms recur to a grade 3 -4 the patient will be removed from the trial. Myelosuppression: If the bone marrow at the end of cycle 1 or 2 of therapy is hypoplastic, as defined by less than 5% cellularity, and the patient has grade 4 hematologic toxicity per CTCAE, th e patient may have a drug -fee window of up to 2 weeks to look for count recovery. Treatment will be re - initiated after this time. For grade 4 hematologic toxicity that is treatment -related and lasts m ore than 5 weeks, one DL reduction will be recommended . If the patient is on DL( -1), the dose will go to 25 mg every other day. If myelosuppression lasts beyond 7 weeks or persists for 2 consecutive courses, bone marrow aspirate will be collected and assessed for disease progression. In the case of PD, patients will come off study. I f the patient has SD or better, they can go back on therapy on the next lower dose than the previous. If the patient was already taking IRX5183 25 mg every other day, they will stop therapy for up to 2 weeks to allow for count recovery prior to resuming the same dose. The following criteria will be used to determine dose skipping, restarting doses, or discontinuing IRX5183 during the all phase s of the trial: Differentiation syndrome: Grade 3 -4 toxicities associated differe ntiation syndrome (unexplained fever, dyspnea, pleural"
28,page_28,"Sponsor: Io Therapeutics, Inc. J15219 (IRB00083855) Version date: September 8, 2017 Io Page 29 of 66 and/or pericardial effusion, pulmonary infiltrates, renal failure, hypotension, and unexplained weight gain greater than 5 kg) will be treated with dexamethasone 10 mg IV twice daily as per section 5.3 .1 above and IRX5183 will be temporarily discontinued until resolution of symptoms to grade 2 or below, while on concomitant steroid therapy . Signs or symptoms of differentiation syndrome that do not return to grade 1 within 2 week s of steroid therapy will be considered a DLT and the patient will be removed from the trial. If differentiation syndrome subsequently recurs to 3 or above, the patient will also be removed from the trial. Rash: Rashes can be common with retinoid therapies. Therefore, there will be no dose modifications for a grade 1 -2 rash. Patients with a grade 1 -2 rash should be treated with topical steroids. If the patient develops or progresses to a grade 3 rash, then the patient should be started on oral steroids (specific type and d osing to be determined by the treating physician) and the drug should be held for up to 2 weeks until the rash resolves to  grade 2. If the patient develops a grade 4 rash, they should permanently discontinue IRX5183 and come off study. 6.2. Discontin uation of IRX5183 for related adverse events : Permanently discontinue IRX5183 for any of the following: 1) Persistent adverse reaction(s) thought to be due to IRX5183 therapy, which require holding more than 2 weeks of treatment doses. 2) Any grade 3 or 4 event (see exceptions in section 5.2 and 6.1 above ). 3) Severe or life -threatening adverse reactions, including any of the following:  Stevens -Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or rash complicated by full thickness dermal ulceration, or nec rotic, bullous, or hemorrhagic manifestations  Respiratory failure non -responsive to steroid therapy  Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality or intercurrent illness , which in the judgment of the investigator presen ts organ specific injury and/or a substan tial clinical risk to the patient with continued dosing.  The following neurological adverse event requires permanent discontinuation of IRX5183 and defines unacceptable neurotoxicity:  Any motor neurologic toxicity >/= grade 3 regardless of causality  Any > /= grade 3 treatment related sensory neurologic toxicity 6.3. Exceptions to permanent discontinuation : 1) Potentially reversible inflammation (< grade 4), attributable to a local anti -tumor reaction and a potential therapeutic response. This includes infla mmat ory reactions at sites of myeloid sarcoma or in draining lymph nodes. 2) Hospitalization for ≤ grade 2 adverse events where the primary reason for hospitalization is to expedite the clinical work -up. 3) Patients with the following conditions where in the investigator’s opinion continuing study drug administration is justified base d on the potential f or continued clinical benefit:  Patients with grade 3 -4 differentiation syndrome -related symptoms if symptoms resolve within 2 week s of high -dose dexamethasone therapy."

TREATMENT EVALUATION AND TOXICITY MONITORING 7.1. Clinical Responses : All patient s initiated on therapy will be evaluable for toxicity. The primary endpoint of clinical efficacy will be evaluated following at least two cycles of therapy. See Section 7 .3 for response criteria. 7.2. Assessment of Response : 1. Complete blood counts with WBC differential will be measured twice weekly during the first cycle of treatment, at least weekly throughout the second cycle of therapy, at least every other week during consolidation/maintenance, and at least monthly during extended maintenance, or as often as clinically indicated . 2. Blood chemistries will be measured twice weekly during the first cy cle of treatment, at least weekly throughout the second cycl e of therapy, at least every other week during consolidation/maintenance, and at least monthly during extended maintenance, or as often as clinically indicated . 3. Fasting lipids with triglyceride evaluation will occur q2 weeks through the first month and then q8 weeks subsequently for assessment of toxicity . 4. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsies for clinical assessment (morphologic analysis, cell count/differential, flow cytometry, FISH/cytogenetics for patients with baseline abnormalities, and molecular studie s for patients with baseline abnormalities) and biologic correlates (see section 8 below) will be collected at the following time points:  Day 14 (± 3 days ) of cycle 1 (not required to stay on study)  At the completion of cycle 1  At the completion of cycle 2  At the end of every two cy cles of treatment during consolidation/maintenance  After every 4 cycles of treatment during extended maintenance  Drug levels will be obtained in the peripheral blood (PB) and BM with liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LCMS ), described in detail in section 7.8. 5. PT/PTT will be followed as needed for those patients who are receiving an anticoagulant during protocol therapy. 6. A track of the total number of transfusions required will be kept. 7.

Response to t reatment will be assessed after completion of at least 2 cycles. Patients will be categorized based on standard IWG -2003 response criteria for AML (Appendix A1) and IWG -2006 criteria for MDS (Appendix A2 -A3) and patients with at least SD will continue on treatment (see section 5.1 ). 9. All p atients will be evaluated for hematologic improvement (HI) per IWG -2006 MDS criteria (Appendix A2). 10.

Patients will be allowed to resume treatment if they relapse during this observation period. 11. If patients continue with SD, HI, or PR after consolidation/maintenance, they w ill continue onto extended maintenance for up to an additional year. 12. At the end of extended maintenance, patients may be able to continue on therapy, per the discretion of Io Therapeutics and the PI. 13. Time to first response (CR/CRi/PR for AML, CR/CRi/PR/H I for MDS) and time to best response will be tracked for each patient. 14. Time from treatment initiation to progression (as defined per IWG criteria in Appendix A1 - A2) will be tracked for each patient. 15. Time from treatment initiation to death will be tracked for each patient. 7.3. Measurement of Response / Response Criteria : The primary endpoint of clinical response is defined by the International Working Group recommendations (see Appendix A1 -A3) for therapeutic trials in AML and MDS and includes CR, comp lete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi, formerly known as morphologic leukemia -free state or marrow CR), partial remission (PR), HI, SD , and PD (Cheson et al., 2003) . We will also include an assessm ent of HI per MDS IWG -2006 recommendations as one of our secondary endpoints in our AML patients (see Appendix A2). In addition to the criteria in Appendix A1, the following will be con sidered as PD : 1) A significant increase in bone marrow blasts beyond 4 week s of starting the drug : a. if baseline 51 -100% blasts – an increase of greater than 50% of baseline b. if baseline 26 -50% blasts – an increase up to 2 x the baseline c. if baseline 0 -25% blasts – an increase up to 3 x the baseline 2) A rising peripheral WBC after adequate dosing with hydroxyurea (see section 5.3 above ) 7.4. Adverse Events : An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not nec essarily have a causal relationship with treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whet her or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product. AEs are to be coded using an internationally recognized dictionary. This study will utilize the Common T oxicity Criteria (CTC) version 4 .0 for toxicity where applicable and adverse event reporting. In cases where CTC can not be applied to the toxic event, the investigator will quantify the toxicity bas ed on intensity, as per section 14.1 below. Patients are to be followed for adverse events for 30 days after the last dose of study d rug. Any adverse event occurring in a patient 30 days after stopping the study drug must be reported. The"

Serious Adverse Event (SAE) : An SAE is defined in the FDA CFR 312 as any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that results in any of the fol lowing outcomes: death, a life -threatening adverse drug experience, inpatient hospitalization, or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events th at may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention t o prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 7.6. Toxicity Reporting : Toxicity scores will be assigned using the NCI Co mmon Toxicity Criteria version 4 .0 twice weekly by the attending or research nurse through the initial cycle of therapy an d weekly thereafter. A copy of the CTC version 4 .0 can be downloaded from CTEP online (http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ). If an unexpected and serious toxicity is seen that results in patients being subjected to unacceptable risk, the trial will be placed on hold while this toxicity is investigated. 7.7. Toxicity Monitoring : The Principal Investigator is responsible for the ongoing safety evaluation of the study and shall provide to Io Therapeutics , Inc. all S erious Adverse Events (SAEs) within 24 hours of the Principal Investigator’s awareness. All fatal and life -threatening events will be reported immediately by phone. A written report will be submitted within ten working days. The first occurrence of any p reviously unexpected clinical event, regardless of grade, will be reported by phone within 24 hours. A written report is also required. Unexpected SAEs are defined as those adverse effects not described in the Io therapeutics investigator’s brochure . Drug -related SAEs are defined as those adverse events that indicate a possible, probably, or likely relationship between IRX5183 administration and the SAE. In addition to standard reporting to the FDA and clinical trials network, SAEs wil l be reported to Io T herapeutics, Inc. within 24 hours of the awareness of the SAE.

Footnote “1” above applies after this reporting period. Effective Date: May 5, 2011 7.8. Pharmacokinetics : In phase I, we plan to first determine pharmacokinetic ( PK) parameters o f IRX5183 on days 1 and 14 (±3) of cycle 1 in the PB an d BM compartments (may be obtained post cycle 1 if day 14 BM specimen not available) . In phase II, we will perform confirmatory testing at these time points in a subgroup of patients. Full sampling, processing, storage, and shipment instructions will be provided in the Laboratory manual. Briefly, trough and peak levels of IRX5183 wil l be determined in the plasma and mononuclear cells (MNC) by obtaining a 4 mL sample of blood (green top tubes -sodium heparin ) ½ hour before the morning dose and then 2 hours (  30 minutes) post drug administration. Phas e I PK data showed that T max generally was in the range of 1-3 hours post dose across individual patients. We will isolate platelet rich plasma (PRP) and"

Drug levels will be determined by liquid chromatography mass spectr oscopy (LCMS), per techniques as previously reported (Kane, 2012) . Peak drug levels will also be determined in the BM compartment on day 14 (± 3 days ) (may be obtained post cycle 1 if day 14 BM specimen not available) , approximately 1 to 3 hours after dosing (as close to 2 hours post as possible, but up to 4 hours post drug administration) . We will allow for flexibility in timing of the BM due to difficulties with scheduling and wait times, but we will aim for collection as close to that of the PB as possible, for optimal comparison of drug concen trations. We are interested to see whether intracellular levels will differ between LSCs, normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and bulk AML cells, and how these levels compare to plasma. We will isolate BM plasma and MNC from the BM aspirate and sort for LSCs, normal HSCs, and bulk AML (when possible) and then freeze at -80 degrees Celsius ( as per the Lab Manual and section 8.2 below) . Depending on the type of AML, we may not be able to isolate CD34+CD38-ALDHint LSCs, in which case we will isolate CD3 4+CD38- cells. Samples will be shipped and analyzed in a batch at the end of the study by LCMS in the laboratory of Dr. Kane, as above . If for any reason during enrollment on the trial, a patient requires a lumbar puncture, we will obtain a specimen for measurement of IRX5183 levels, in order to determine whether the drug penetrates the blood b rain barrier. We would obtain 2 mL CSF to be frozen and sent to Dr. Kane on dry ice for analysis by LCMS. We would also collect a 4 mL sample of PB ( green top tu be- sodium heparin ) at the same time point, isolating and freezing PRP and MNC as above. See lab manual for details on processing, storage, and shipment instructions. 8. CORRELATIVE STUDIES 8.1. Biologic activity : Assessi ng the biologic activ ity of IRX5183 in AML and MDS patients is critical to the interpretation of any clinical activity. Successful induction of terminal differentiation would be expected to be measurable by changes in the malignant cell phenotype as well as possib le cytogenet ic changes . The following biologic correlatives will be conducted in the laboratories o f Drs. Gabriel Ghiaur and Richard Jones : 1. In vivo induction of terminal differentiation - PB and BM markers of myeloid differentiation such as CD15 and CD11b (as direct ed by disease phenotype ) will be measured by flow cytometry prior to the initiation of therapy and repeated on the day 14 (± 3) and/or post cycle 1 specimens, with a preference for day 14 (± 3), while ongoing differentiation is more likely. 2. Effect on l eukemia stem cells as an indicator of differentiation – ratio of LSC population to normal HSC population will be determined at baseline, day 14 ( ± 3 days ), and later endpoints in select patients. If the patient’s leukemia consists of an ALDH intermediate population, we will determine the ratio of CD34+CD38-ALDHint LSCs to"

We will use techniques as we have previously published (Gerber et al., 2012) . 3. In vivo changes in measurable cytogenetic alterations – baseline clinical fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis will be done prior to starting treatment and subsequent analyses will take place with each clinical BM, in order to assess for a cytogenetic response to therapy. When possible, FISH will additionally be used to quantify the cytogenetic changes in PB and marrow myeloid progenitors prior and following therapy on day 14 (± 3 days ) and/or after cycle 1 . The presence of mature neutrophils with the malignant cytogeneti c abnormality in the PB will serve as evidence for terminal differentiation of leukemia cells from the therapy. 4. In vitro induction of terminal differentiation – the susceptibility of malignant progenitors to IRX5183 will be studied in vitro . CD34 positi ve progenitors will be isolated from bone marrow or PB and exposed to IRX5183 in the presence and absence of the patient’s own stromal feeder layer. We will look at the impact on differentiation by flow cytometry using various differentiation markers (e.g . CD15, CD11b) and by CFU assay. Techniques will be done as previously reported (Su et al., 2015) and per Laboratory Manual. 5. Plasma differentiating activity – the differentiating ability of different dose levels of IRX5183 will be assessed by treating NB4 APL cell lines with patient plasma obtained at day 14 and beyond and then measuring CD11b expression by flow cytometry, compared to control (see Lab Manual). 6. Cell cycle and apoptosis assays – cell cycle and apoptosis assays will be performed in CD34+ cells at baseline and different time points throughout the trial. We will assess viable MNCs with flow cyto metry, looking at Annexin -5 and Propidium Iodide (PI) as markers of apoptosis and Ki67/Hoechst to assess cells in G 0/G1/SG 2M. In addition, we will assess Bcl -2 expression levels by Western blot. See Lab Manual for full details. 8.2. Cellular Collection and Processing : The lab s of Drs. Gabriel Ghiaur an d Richard Jones will support the pl anned biologic correlatives through the timely collectio n and processing of the patient PB and marrow samples. All operating procedures for specimen collection, handling and storage will be standardized. Common standardiz ed operating procedures (SOPs) will be to collect approximately 1 0 mL PB (1 green top tube -sodium heparin ) at the time points of bone marrow assessments ( i.e., pre -study, day 14 ±3, after cycle 1, cycle 2, cycle 4, cyc le 6 (and beyond as per f igure 2 in section 5.1 above) . Bone marrow aspirate , approximately 10 mL (1 green top tube -sodium heparin) , will be collected at the above listed time points , per the protocol in figure 2 . For a patient that progresses and is removed from study treatment, additional blood or BM may be obtained at the time of routine collection. Re-adjustment of the direction of bone marrow aspirate needle should take a place after the clinical collection to prevent hemodilution. At the time of collection, tubes must be thoroughly mi xed to prevent clotting."

Teratogenic Effects : There is a high risk that a severely deformed infant wi ll result if IRX 5183 is administered during pregnancy. If, nonetheless, it is determined that I RX 19518 3 represents the best available tr eatment for a woman of childbearing potential, it must be assured that the patient has received full information and warnings of the risk to the fetus if she were to be pregnant and of the risk of possible contraception fa ilure and has been instructed in the need to use two reliable forms of contraception simultaneously during therapy and for 1 month following discontinuation of therapy, and has acknowledged her understanding of the need for using dual contraception, unless abstinence is the chosen method. Within 1 we ek prior to the institution of IRX 5183 therapy, the patient should have blood or urine collected for a serum or urine pregnancy test with a sensitivity of at least 50 mIU/mL. When possible, IRX 5183 therapy shou ld be delayed until a negative result from this test is obtained. When a delay is not possible, the patient should be placed on two reliable forms of contraception. Pregnancy testing and contraception counseling should be repeated mo nthly throughout the period of IRX 5183 treatment. 9.2.3. Toxicity Profile of Oral Retinoids (Class Effect): The safety profile of IRX 5183 may correspond with the characteristic profil e of systemic RAR agonists (ATRA [tretinoin], 13 -cis-retinoic acid [isotretinoin], acitretin an d etretinate) currently in use for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), acne, and psoriasis. The most frequently reported adverse events in this drug class include headache, fever, skin/mucous membrane dryness, bone pain, nausea/vomiting, rash, mucositis, pruritus, increased sweating, visual disturbances, ocular disorders, alopecia, skin changes, changed visual acuity, bone inflammation, and visual field defects. Headache occurring several hours after drug ingestion is also a common side -effect. Mild analgesics generally suffice for control and the patient usually develops a tolerance to the effect. Bone pain occurs in 10% to 20% of patients and usually remits with continued treatment: occasionally narcotic analgesia may be required to overcome the pain. Skin and mucous membrane effects can be managed with topical lubricants."

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 11.1. Study design & endpoints : In the dose -escalation part of the study, there will be 3 dose levels (dose level 1 [DL1] with 50 mg, DL2 with 75 mg, and DL3 with 100 mg), with 1 additional dose level to be only used if excessive toxicity noted at the DL1. There will be no intra -patient dose escalation. Dose - escalation rules are defined through a standard 3+3 algorithm as outlined in Section 5.2. The phase II expansion part of the study will aim to recruit a total of 27 patients with either R/R - AML or HR -MDS, and there will be an interim analysis after 13 patients for futility through a Simon two -stage minimax design based upon a Type I error rate of 0.05, power of 0.8, response probability of poor drug 0.05, and response probability of good drug of 0.2 , based on pri or relapsed and refractory AML trials and CTEP data on non -pediatric oncology trials from 2001 to 2012 (Itzykson et al., 2015; Ritchie et al., 2013; Thol et al., 2015; Yoko Korenaga Fukuda, 2014) .

Response wil l be defined per IWG criteria as CR, CRi , or PR for AML patients and as CR, CRi, PR, or HI for MDS patients (see definitions in Appendix A) and will be determined with each BM assessment . The composite of these responses acros s our study population will be referred to as the overall response rate (ORR). Rates of CR, CRi, PR, HI, and the composite endpoint of ORR will be summarized and reported with an exact 95% confidence interval. 11.2. Primary endpoints : 1) Phase I - description of toxicity of IRX5183 by grading and tabulation using NCI -CTC Version 4.0 criteria (section 8). The DLT will be defined as per section 5.2. 2) Phase II – best response after at least 2 cycles of therapy per IWG criteria ( Appendix A ). 11.3. Secondary endpoints : 1) Phase I - Description of PK parameters of IRX5183 at baseline and day 14, both in the peripheral blood and BM compartments, markers of myeloid differentiation by flow cytometry (e.g. CD15, CD11b), BM blast count, ANC before and af ter treatment, and changes in detectable cytogenetic abnormalities in the blood and BM compartments at the different dose levels . We will also describe best response per IWG criteria at any time , time to first and best response, and clinical parameters suc h as transfusion requirements, blood counts, qual ity of life assessments, and time to either progression or death. 2) Phase II – Description of IWG response and other clinical criteria assessed in the dose escalation phase for the RP2D. We will also meas ure markers of differentiation assessed in the dose escalation phase for the RP2D, and lastly, the toxicity profile at the RP2D dose. 11.4. Sample size considerations : For the dose -escalation part of the trial, we will enroll up to 18 patients, per stan dard 3+3 design with 3 DLs (see table 2 in section 5.2). Once we have determined our RP 2D, we will proceed to phase II of the trial, where we will recruit an additional 21 R/R-AML or HR -MDS patients at the RP2D, for a total sample size at the RP2D of 27 ( inclusive of pa tients treated at the RP2D in phase I ). This sample size was determined using a minimax Simon two -stage design, as described in Section 11.1. Based on prior experience at our i nstitution in this patient population, we will account for a dr opout rate of 3 0%, so we wil l aim to recruit an additional 8 patients to the dose expansion phase, so that our t rial will accrue up to 35 patients to this phase . In phase II of the trial, the study team will meet regularly to determine whether it is worth while to continue enrollment, if an excessive number of patients are unable to complete 2 full cycles of therapy at the RP2D, whether for reasons of DLTs or PD."

Expected accrual rate : We expect to accrue up to 3 patients with R/R -AML and/or HR -MDS per month once the study is open. Enrollment is expected to be compl ete within 12 -18 months . The duration of therapy and follow -up period is up to 24 months (excluding any patients that may be eligible to continue on therapy after the trial period per di scretion of Io Therapeutics and the PI) . Therefore, the total expected duration of the study, including recruitment, therapy, and follow -up, is expected to be a maximum of 50 months. 11.6. Stratification factors : There are no planned stratifications fo r this protocol. 11.7. Analysis of secondary endpoints : Pharmacokinetics: In the dose escalation phase, we plan to first determine PK parameters of IRX5183 at baseline and day 14 (± 3 days ) in the PB and BM compartments. In the dose expansion phase, we will perform confirmatory testing in a subgroup of patients at the same time points . PK analyses will be largely descriptive , using Student’s t -tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests comparing drug concentrations at both time points. We will also assess th e peak and trough levels in the PB at the above time points. Pharmacodynamics: Biologic correlates include measurement of markers of myeloid differentiation by flow cytometry (e.g. CD15, CD11b), BM blast count, and ANC at the different dose levels in the dose escalation phase and at the RP2D in the expansion phase at the different time points compared to baseline. In addition, we will look at the ratio of ANC to BM blast count as clinical marker for differentiation at the different time points compar ed to baseline. Statistics will be descriptive and will consist of paired Student’s t -tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests comparing averages between 2 time points (e.g. after induction therapy compared to baseline). We will furthermore assess in vivo chang es in detectable chromosomal abnormalities in patients with baseline cytogenetic alterations that define their malignant clones. This will be measured by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with cells from the individual cellular compartments quantified as a ratio of malignant to non-malignant cells (i.e., mononuclear cells with the cytogenetic finding to those without). Successful differentiation would be expected t o result in a decrease in mononuclear cells harboring the cytogenetic abnormality. Th ese results will be summarized using descriptive statistics and exploratory plots will be used to illustrate results. Clinical activity: In the dose expansion phase, we will quantify best IWG response at any time, clinical parameters such as weekly trans fusion requirements after each cycle of therapy compared to baseline, blood"

We will also assess for best IWG response at any time and HI in our AML patients per the IWG-2006 MDS criteria (Appendix A3 ). We will look at all clinical parameters both in aggregate and as a subgroup analysis in AML and MDS patients. For response calculation s, the report will contain at least a section with all eligible patients. Another section of the report will detail the response rate for evaluable patients only. T he response rate analysis based on a subset of patients will explain which patients were excluded and for what reasons. We will provide 95% confidence limits as appropriate . Average weekly transfusion requirements over the duration of a 28-day cycle will be compared to the baseline average weekly transfusion requirement over the 4 to 8 weeks prior to treatment initiation. Event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) will be reported with a 95% confidence interval. FACTleu version 4 questionnaire s will be analyzed per instructions on FACIT.org (Cella et al., 2012) . Scoring gui delines are listed in Appendix D . We hypothesize that QOL will improve over the course of the study; however, without a comparison arm, it will be difficult to determine whether this regimen will yield a better or worse QOL outcome than other regimens. Therefore, the questionnaire will serve as more of an exploratory assessment to use when planning further studies. We will look at m arkers of feasibility, including pe rcentage of completed questions, the time it takes to complete, and how many patients participate in the survey. Toxicity: Beyond the dose escalation portion of the study, we will continue to track for adverse even ts throughout the duration of the trial. We will evaluate the number of patients who experience different toxicities with percentages and descriptive statistics and will explore any potential correlations between IRX5183 -induc ed differentiation , toxicity, and clinical responses (e.g. whether patients who experience toxicities characteristic of DS have a higher chance of clinical response) . Therefore, IWG responses and survival endpoints will be qualitatively compared between patients who do and do not hav e evidence of DS, if we do happen to see this clinical syndrome in our study population . Exploratory assessments: We plan to assess whether observed in vivo evidence of differentiation per flow cytometry markers, ANC, or BM blast count correlate with ORR, EFS, and/or OS. 11.8. Reporting and exclusions : 11.8.1. Evaluation of toxicity: All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with IRX5183 . 11.8.2. Evaluation of response:"

The primary endpoint to the dose expansion phase is response per IWG criteria after receiving at lea st 2 cycles of therapy. Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received a t least 2 cycle s of therapy, and have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered evaluable for response. These patients will have their res ponse classified according to the definitions stated in Appendix A . Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prio r to the end of cycle 2 will be considered not evalu able and will be taken off study . An incorrect treatment schedule or drug adm inistration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate. Patients with disease progression, death due to their disease, and death due to toxicity prior to completion of in duction therapy will be excluded from the primary analysis . This will prevent dismissal of an active drug based on progression in patients with highly refractory disease who are unable to receive enough of the drug to see a clinical benefit . Patients who are unable to complete induction therapy for any reason will be treated as missing data and additional patients will be recruited in their place to reach our target sample size of 27 for p hase II . 12. DATA SAFETY MONITORING PLAN The study principal investigator will be responsible for the conduction of the stu dy, including the monitoring of the study’s safety and oversight of the data collection. The PI will follow the Data Safety and Monitoring plan (DSMP) outlined in the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center’s policy. This is a DSMP Level I study under t he SKCCC D SMP (12/6/2012) , based on the risk and monitoring needs . The Clinical Research Office will perform an audit after the first subject has been treated and then periodically depending on the rate of accrual and prior audit results. All trial monitor ing and reporting will be reviewed annually by the SKCCC Safety Monitoring Committee. The PI is responsible for internally monitoring the study. Data must be reviewed to assure the validity of data, as well as, the safety of the subjects. The PI will also monitor the progress of the trial, review safety reports, and clinical trial efficacy endpoints and to confirm that the safety outcomes favor continuation of the stu dy. 12.1. Data Reporting : External data monitoring will be performed by the Johns Hopkin s Clinical Research Office in accordance with a level I risk/complexity study, as described in the Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Cancer Center (JHCCC) Clinical Trial Monitoring Program guidelines. Intensity: The CTC 4 .0 will be used to grade adverse event s. If an adverse event can not be assessed using the CTC, the investigator will classify the intensity of an adverse event according to the following definitions: 1) Mild: The subject is aware of signs or symptoms, but they are easily tolerated. Usually d oes not require additional therapy or discontinuation of study drug."
45,page_45,"Sponsor: Io Therapeutics, Inc. J15219 (IRB00083855) Version date: September 8, 2017 Io Page 46 of 66 2) Moderate: The signs and symptoms are sufficient to restrict, but do not prevent usual activity; possibly requires additional therapy but usually does not require discontinuation of st udy drug. 3) Severe: The subject is unable to perform usual activities and usually requires discontinuation of study drug. Drug relationship: The investigator is to classify the study product relationship of an adverse event to the investigational prod uct according to the following definitions. Adverse events that are classified as “possible”, “probable”, or “definite” will be considered drug related. 1) None: The time course between the administration of study product and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event rules out a causal relationship and/or another cause is confirmed and no indication of involvement of the study product in the occurrence/worsening of the adverse event exists. 2) Unlikely: The time course between administration of t he study product and occurrence or worsening of the adverse event makes a causal relationship unlikely; the known effects of the study product or of the substance class provide no indication of involvement in occurrence/worsening of the adverse event and a nother cause adequately explaining the adverse event is known; regarding the occurrence/worsening of the adverse event, a plausible causal chain may be deduced from the known effects of the study product or the substance class but another cause is much mor e probable; or another cause is confirmed and involvement of the study product in the occurrence/worsening of the adverse event is unlikely. 3) Possible: Regarding the occurrence/worsening of the adverse event, a plausible causal chain may be deduced fro m the pharmacological properties of the study product or the substance class, but another cause just as likely to be involved is also known; although the pharmacological properties of the study product or the substance class provide no indication of involv ement in the occurrence/worsening of the adverse event, no other cause gives adequate explanation. 4) Probable: The pharmacological properties of the study product or of the substance class and/or the course of the adverse event suggest involvement of th e study product in the occurrence/worsening of the adverse event, although another cause cannot be ruled out. 5) Definite: The pharmacological properties of the study product or of the substance class and the course of the adverse event indicate involvem ent of the study product in the occurrence/worsening of the adverse event and no indication of other causes exists. 6) Unclassifiable: [only used for SAE] The available information is not sufficient for causality assessment. Outcome: The investigator will record the outcome of the AE choosing one of the following categories: Recovered/resolved,"

Data handling and record keeping : 1) Case report forms (CRFs) - The investigator and study coordinator will document in the patient files (hospital files). Data required according to this protocol are to be recorded on the CRFs developed by the Principal Investigator. Entries on the CRF must be made with a ballpoint pen and must be legible. Any documents related to the study must be archived at the study site or in a central archive. This includes the careful listing of the identities of the patients involved in the study. This list and the signed informed consent statements are key documents in the files to be stored by the investigator. Patient (hospital) files will be archived according to local regulations. All documents related to the study must be retained until at least 15 years after the end of the study. 2) Laboratory data and reference laboratories - For laboratory services provided by the investigator, the investigator must supply the sponsor with a complete list of all normal laboratory values for the laboratory u tilized, as well as proof of laboratory certification by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) . 3) Patient registry - The investigator should maintain a patient registry of all patients entered into the study in the event a safety issue arises after study completion. 13. REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS / ETHICS 13.1. Institutional review board (IB) / ethics committee (EC) approval : The protocol for this study has been designed in accordance with the general ethical principles outlined in t he Declaration of Helsinki. The review of this protocol by the IRB/EC and the performance of all aspects of the study, including the methods used for obtaining informed consent, must also be in accordance with principles enunciated in the declaration, as well as ICH Guidelines, Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 50 Protection of Human Subjects and Part 56 Institutional Review Boards. The Investigator will be responsible for preparing documents for submission to the relevant IRB/EC and obtaining written approval for this study. The approval will be obtained prior to the initiation of the study. The approval for both the protocol and informed consent must specify the date of approval, protocol number and version date. Any changes to this protocol after receipt of IRB/EC approval made by the Sponsor or the Investigator must be in the form of a written amendment and the amendment will be appended to"

Any protocol amendment suggested by the Investigator has to be approved by the Sponsor prior to implementation. Approval of amendments by the IRB is required prior to their implementation unless there are overriding safety reasons. If the change or deviation increases risk to the study popul ation, or adversely affects the validity of the clinical investigation or the subject’s rights, full approval must be obtained prior to implementation. For changes that do not involve increased risk or affect the validity of the investigation or the subjec t’s rights, approval may be obtained by expedited review. When appropriate, an amendment may require a change to a written consent form as well. The Investigator is also responsible for notifying the IRB/EC of any serious deviations from the protocol, or a nything else that may involve added risk to subjects. Any advertisements used to recruit subjects for the study must be reviewed and approved by the IRB/EC prior to use. 13.2. Recruitment: Potential participants may be identified during chart review in ad vance of a routine clinic visit or during a routine clinic visit with a provider. Individuals will be approached by the provider or study team to determine willingness to learn more about a study for which they may be eligible. Discussions regarding study participation will take place privately and individuals will be provided with the IRB approved consent form. In addition, potential participants may contact the study team directly. This contact may be in the form of telephone, email, etc. Initial discussi ons regarding study participation may take place by phone, email, etc., and individuals may be provided with the IRB approved consent form and other IRB reviewed and approved materials (e.g., Patient Handout), as applicable. In all cases, as much time as i s needed to consider study participation will be allowed to possible participants; resulting in multiple phone calls, visits, emails, or other communication, as necessary. For individuals who choose to take part, informed consent will happen as per the con sent process. 13.3. Subject confidentiality : The study will conform to the subject’s right to protection against invasion of privacy. In compliance with United States federal regulations, when necessary, representatives of the FDA or other regulatory au thorities to review and/or copy any medical records relevant to the study in accordance with local laws. Should direct access to medical records require a waiver or authorization separate from the subject’s statement of informed consent, it is the responsi bility of the Investigator to obtain such permission in writing from the appropriate individual. 13.4. Study records requirements : The Investigator must ensure that the records and documents pertaining to the conduct of the study and the distribution of the study drug, that is copies of CRFs and source documents (original documents, data, and records [e.g., hospital records; clinical and office charts; laboratory notes; memoranda; subject’s diaries or evaluation checklists; SAE reports, pharmacy dispensin g records; recorded data from automated instruments; copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate copies; microfiches; photographic negatives, microfilm, or magnetic media; x -rays; subject files; and records kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and"

The Investigator agrees to adhere to the document/records retention procedures by signing the protocol. PHI will be retained to justify screen failures, and will be stored under the same secure conditions as all study -related data for the length of the trial. 13.5. Evaluation of benefits and risks/discomforts : Potential benefits : Patients will receive ev aluation and treatment of their malignancy as a result of participating in this trial. The trial will provide information on how IRX5183 should be administered to patients, but may or may not help a specific patient personally. This treatment may offer tem porary control of the disease, but is not expected to be curative by this protocol. Alternative approaches to entering this trial, including supportive care only, will also be discussed before the verbal and written consent is obtained regarding the risks, benefits, and the treatment requirements of this trial. Measures for minimizing risk : Administering IRX5183 to patients may involve risks that are currently unforeseeable. Side effects can be unpredictable in nature and severity, although all care will be taken to minimize them. If patients suffer any physical injury as a result of participating in this study, immediate medical treatment is available at the treatment center. Frequent blood work will be taken to monitor side effects. Although no compensat ion is available, any injury will be evaluated and treated in keeping with the benefits or care to which patients are entitled under applicable regulations. Malignancies with no further standard treatment options generally have a poor prognosis. Therefore, patients may experience significant treatment -related morbidity, and/or complications from progression of their disease. 13.6. Risks/benefits analysis : Data gathered from both clinical and laboratory evaluations in this trial will be analyzed frequen tly to ensure safety of patients. Any new or significant finding(s) found during the course of the research will be shared and explained to each participant since that may affect a patient’s willingness to participate further. Patient’s anonymity will be p rotected to the maximum extent in all publications and presentations that result from this research. 13.7. Patient information and consent : The investigator or consent designee will explain the nature of the study, its purpose and associated procedure s, the expected duration, and the potential benefits and risks of participation to each patient prior to his/her entry into the study (i.e., before examinations and procedures associated with selection for the study are performed). Each patient will have a mple opportunity to ask questions and will be informed about the right to withdraw from the study at any time without any disadvantage and without having to provide reasons for this decision."

J15219 (IRB00083855) Version date: September 8, 2017 Io Page 50 of 66 Following this informative discussion, a patient will be asked if he/she is willing to sign and personally date a statement of informed consent. Only if the patient voluntarily agrees to sign the informed consent statement and has done so, may he/she enter the study. The patient will receive a copy of the signed and d ated informed consent form. Those members of the research team (principal investigator, co -investigator, research nurses) who consent patients have been trained in informed consent procedures, are familiar with the protocol, and are listed as a consente r in the application document. Patients are given adequate time and privacy to consider the research study. Before the patient signs the consent, the consenter must be satisfied that the participant understands the information provided, has had an opportun ity to discuss the information and ask questions, and is aware that he/she may withdraw from the study at any time. Non -English speaking participants will be consented according to OHRP and JHMIRB policies. The signed informed consent statement is to rema in in the investigator's files. The informed consent form and any other written information provided to patients will be revised whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the patient's consent, or there is an amendment to the protocol which necessitates a change to the content of the written informed consent form. The investigator will inform the patient of changes in a timely manner and will ask the patient to confirm continuation of his/her participation in the study by his/her signature on the revised informed consent form. Any revised written informed consent form must receive the IRB’s approval/favorable opinion in advance of use. 13.8. Financial disclosure : Each investigator (including the principal investigator and any subinvestigators) who is directly involved in the treatment or evaluation of research subjects must disclose certain financial arrangements. The following arrangements with, and interests of, investigators (including the spouse and depe ndent chil dren) must be disclosed to the FDA: A) Compensation made to the investigator in which the value of compensation could be affected by study outcome (e.g., higher compensation for a favorable outcome than for an unfavorable outcome, or a royalty interest re lated to product sales); B) A proprietary interest by the investigator in the tested product, including, but not limited to, a patent, trademark, copyright or licensing agreement; C) Any equity interest in the sponsor of this study, i.e., any ownership i nterest, stock options, or other financial interest whose value cannot be readily determined through reference to public prices, or any equity interest in a publicly held company that exceeds $ 50,000 in value held during the time the investigator is carry ing out the study and for 1 year following completion of the study; D) Significant payments of other sorts, i.e., payments that have a cumulative monetary value of $25,000 or more, made by the sponsor of a covered study to the investigator or the investig ator’s institution to support activities of the investigator exclusive of the costs of conducting the clinical study or other clinical studies, (e.g., a grant to fund ongoing research, compensation in the form"
