The overall reason for the amendment: The protocol is being amended due to FDA feedback and correction of errors. Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s) Rationale: Incorrect EudraCT Number updated to correct EudraCT Number . Cover page; Synopsis EudraCT Number changed from : 2016 -001163 -27 To: 2016 -001163 -37 Rationale: DLQI assessment isnot being completed in this study. Synopsis, Time and Events Schedule, Abbreviations, Endpoints, Efficacy Evaluations, Source DocumentationRemove all references to DLQI (endpoints, Psoriasis Response Assessments, T&E, etc.) as this assessment is not included in this study and should not have been included in the original protocol .

6,page_6,"CNTO 1959 (guselkumab) Clinical Protocol CNTO1959PSA3001 Amendment 1 7 Approved, Date: 25 January 2018Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s) Rationale: To update the footnotes in Table 1 to provide clarification. Table 1, Time and Events Schedule from screening through Week 60Footnote ‘w’ was m odified from : Prior to randomization, FSH is required for selected female subjects to determine childbearing potential. This test is only required for a female subject of any age with amenorrhea for at least 6 months. This test should NOT be done for any female subject of childbearing potential or female subjects >45 years of age with amenorrhea for at least 12 months. Refer to Inclusion Criterion 11for details. Updated to: Prior to randomization, FSH is required for selected female subjects with amenorrhea for less than 12 months. T wo FSH m easurements are needed to confirm amenorrhea in these subjects. This test should not be done for any female sub ject of childbearing potential or female subjects w ith amen orrhea for at least 12 months. Refer to Inclusion Criterion 11 for details. Rationale: All visits through Week 24 have a visit window of ± 4 days, all visits after Week 24 up to Week 60 have a visit window of ± 7 days , and the Week 60 visit orthe safety visit (12 w eeks after the last dose in subjects who discontinued study treatments) w ill have a visit window of ±14 day s instead of all visits t hrough Week 60 have a visit window of ±7 day s. Time & Events ScheduleUpdate footnote b in the T&E from : All other visits through Week 60 will have a visit window of ±7 days counting from Week 0 as Day 1 ; Week 60 visit will have a visit window of ±14 days. Updated t o: Through Week 24, study visits will have a visit window of ± 4 days; after Week 24, study visits at the site will have a visit w indow of ± 7 days; Week 60 visit or the final safety visit (12 w eeks after the last dose in subjects who discontinued study treatment) will have a visit window of ± 14 days. Section 7 Treatment Com plianceUpdated paragraph 7 from : All post -baseline visits through Week 52 w ill have a visit window of ±7 days counting from Week 0 as Day 1. The safety follow -up visit at 12 weeks after the last study agent administration will have a visit w indow of ±14 days. If a study visit occurs outside this window , the Sponsor should be consulted about how the subject should resume his or her norm al dose schedule. Updated to: Through Week 24, study visits will have a visit window of ±4 days. After Week 24, study visits at the site will have a visit w indow of ±7 days. The Week 60 visit or the safety visit (12 w eeks after the last dose in subjects who discontinue study treatment) will have a visit window of ±14 days. If a study visit o ccurs outside this window , the Sponsor should be consulted about how the subject should resume his or her normal dose schedule. Rationale: Revised for clarification. Time and Events ScheduleFootnote ‘r’ revised from : All patient questionnaires should be completed before any other tests, procedures, or evaluations on the day of the visit for baseline and post -baseline visits. The questionnaires will be completed/recorded on the tablet. To: All patient questionnaires s hould be completed before any other tests, procedures, or evaluations on the day of the visit for baseline and post -baseline visits. NCT03162796"

Therefore footnote ‘r’ no longer applie s. Time and Events ScheduleRemove footnote ‘r’ from PsA Evaluations for Arthritis. Rationale: Typographical error. Time & Events Schedule Footnote ‘t’ should be footnote ‘u’ for the following items in the T&E: Hepatitis B and C Serologies HIV Antibody Test Chemistry Lipid Panel C-reactive Protein Rheumatoid factor Follicle Stimulating Hormone. Rationale: Typographical error. Section 4.1.

The binding of guselkumab to the IL-23p19 subunit blocks the binding of extracellular IL-23 to the cell surface IL-23 receptor, inhibiting IL-23 specific intracellular signaling and subsequent activation and cytokine production. In this manner, guselkumab inhibits the biological activity of IL-23 in all in vitro assays examined.

These subjects will remain on the dosing regimen they were randomized to at We ek 0. At Week 16, subjects who meet early escape criteria will be allowed to initiate or increase the dose of one of the permitted concomitant medications up to the maximum allowed dose as specified above, as selected by the investigator. Titration to a stable dose of the medication should be completed for subjects qualifying for early escape by the Week 24 visit. At Week 24, all subjects in the placebo group (Group III) will cross over to receive guselkumab 100 mg SC q4w through Week 52; this will allow for collection of additional safety data for the 100 mg SC q4w dose. Subjects in the guselkumab groups (Groups I and II) will remain on the dosing regimen they were randomized to at Week 0, through Week 52. Subjects will be followed for new adverse events (AEs)and serious adverse events ( SAEs ) up to 12weeks following the last study agent administration. The end of the study is defined as the time the last subject completes the last study visit. For subjects who complete the Week 52visit, the last study visit is the Week 60 visit. For subjects who discontinue study agent prior to Week 52, the last study visit is the final safety visit (12 weeks after the last study agent administration) . An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DM C) will be established to monitor unblinded data on an ongoing basis through at least the Week 24 database lock (DBL )to ensure the continuing safety of the subjects enrolled in this study. Samples for the analysis of pharmacodynamic biomarkers will be co llected from all subjects. A pharmacogenomic blood sample will be collected from subjects who consent separately to this component of the study where local regulations permit. Subject participation in pharmacogenomic research is optional . Database locks are scheduled at Weeks 24 and End of Study (Week 60). SUBJECT POPULATION The target study population is subjects with active PsA who have had inadequate response to standard therapies (eg, non-biologic DMARDs, apremilast or NSAIDs). In addition, approxim ately 30% of the study population may have been previously exposed to up to 2 anti-TNFα agents. Stable doses of concomitant NSAIDs, oral corticosteroids, and selected non-biologic DMARDs (limited to MTX, SSZ, HCQ, or LEF) will be allowed but are not requir ed. This population is considered appropriate to provide relevant efficacy and safety information for the intended use of guselkumab in PsA. Subjects must also meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Guselkumab 100 mg and match ing liquid placebo for guselkumab will be provided in a single -use prefilled syringe (PFS) assembled with the UltraSafe PLUSTMPassive Needle Guard (PFS -U). Study agent will be administered at the site by a health care professional (HCP) until the subject (or caregiver) is trained for self-administration. Study agent will be administered by site personnel at Week s 0 and 4.Beginning at Week 8, at the discretion of the investigator and subject, and after appropriate and documented training, subjects may self-administer study agent at the investigative site under the supervision of an HCP. A caregiver may also be trained to administer study agent. Subjects unable or unwilling to self -administer will continue to have study agent injections performed by an H CP. The option to begin self-administration of study agent at home will begin at Week 32. At Week 28, subjects (or a caregiver) who are able to self-administer will be supplied study agent for self-administration away from the site (ie, at home). Subjects will be instructed to contact the investigator NCT03162796"

The samples will be used to better understand the biology of PsA, to provide a biological assessment of the response of patients to treatment with guselkumab, to analyze differences between responders and non-responders, and to determine if the markers can be used to classify patients as potential responders prior to treatment.  Ribonucleic acid (RNA) from whole blood samples will be used for gene expression analysis to determine themolecular profile of PsA and to assess changes in gene expression post guselkumab treatment.  Pharmacogenomics testing is optional. For subjects who provide consent, a whole blood sample will be utilized for pharmacogenomics evaluati on. The analysis may include complete genome -wide testing and/or targeted sequencing. The testing will be done to search for links of specific genes to disease or response to drug. SAFETY EVALUATIONS The safety and tolerability of study agent (guselkumab and placebo) will be monitored by collecting information on adverse events (including injection site and allergic reactions), clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, vital signs, suicidal ideation or behavior (using the electronic Columbia -Suici de Severity Rating Scale questionnaires), concomitant medication review, and early detection of tuberculosis. Serum and/or plasma samples collected for pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic analyses may also be used to evaluate safety concerns that may arise during or after the study period. Safety wi ll be monitored through Week 60. STATISTICAL METHODS Simple descriptive summary statistics, such as n, mean, standard deviation (SD) , median, inter quantile range, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables, and counts and percentages for discrete variables will be used to summarize most data . Sample Size Determination The sample size was chosen based on the data from a Sponsor’s recent PsA study with ustekinumab , CNTO1275PSA3002 ,that included subjects previo usly treated with biologic anti-TNFα agents. The ACR 20 response rates at Week 24 from CNTO1275PSA3002 were 20.2%, 43.7% and 43.8%, respectively, for the placebo, ustekinumab 45 mg, and ustekinumab 90 mg treatment groups. In order to ensure a statistical power of >90% at the significance level of 0.05 (2-sided), assuming that each of guselkumab 100 mg groups achieves an ACR 20 response of 40% compared with the placebo group response of 20% at Week 24, a total of 360 subjects are planned to be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to each of treatment groups. The table below provides the power evaluation of various assumptions. NCT03162796"

Note that the intercurrent event of Treatment Failure prior to Week 24 (defined below) will be treated as non-respo nse for the primary analysis, regardless of the observed ACR 20 response status. Treatment Failure Criteria 1.Discontinued study agent injections due to lack of efficacy. 2.Terminate study participation for any reason. 3.Initiated or increased the dose of DMARDs (MTX, SSZ, HCQ, LEF) or oral corticosteroids over baseline for PsA. 4.Initiated protocol prohibited medications/therapies for PsA. Subjects with missing data at Week 24 will be considered nonresponders. The treatment effect of each guselkumab group versus placebo will be tested using the Cochran-Mantel- Haenszel test stratified by prior exposure to anti -TNF agents (yes/no) and baseline DMARD (MTX, SSZ, HCQ, LEF) use (yes/no). The magnitude of the effect will be estimated by the difference in ACR 20 response rates between the guselkumab and placebo groups with the 95% confidence interval calculated based on Wald statistics. In order to control the overall Type 1 error rate, the primary analysis will be tested in a fixed sequence. 1.Guselkumab 100 mg q4w ve rsus placebo in ACR 20 response at Week 24. 2.Guselkumab 100 mg at Week 0, 4 then q8w versus placebo in ACR 20 response at Week 24. With the above specified order, each of the hypotheses will be tested at a 2 -sided α -level of 0.05 provided that significance is achieved for the preceding hypothesis in the specified order. If a given comparison is not significant at the 2-sided α-level of 0.05, the remaining treatment group comparisons will be considered as supportive analysis. NCT03162796"

INTRODUCTION CNTO 1959 (guselkumab) is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 lambda monoclonal antibody that binds to the p19 protein subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL‑23) with high specificit y and affinity . The binding of guselkumab to the IL-23p19 subunit blocks the binding of extracellular IL-23 to the cell surface IL-23 receptor, inhibiting IL-23 specific intracellular signaling and subsequent activation and cytokine production. In this manner, guselkumab inhibits the biological activity of IL -23 in all in vitro assay s examined. Guselkumab has been extensively studied in 3 large Phase 3 studies in psoriasis.

Disease Background Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthropath y of the peripheral and axial joints associated with psoriasis.42The estimated prevalence of PsA in the general population varies from 0.02% to 1.0% across the world.11,42 In patients with psoriasis, the prevalence of PsA ranges from 6% to 42%.11Psoriatic arthritis is a multi -faceted disease that impacts the joints, soft tissues, and skin, all of which affect qualit y of life.14,41 The burden of disease can be severe, with some patients developing destructive arthritis leading to bony erosion and loss of joint architecture; some patients even require surgical intervention to alleviate pain and restore function of severel y damaged joints .52 Psoriatic arthritis not only results in functional disability and impaired qualit y of life, but patients with this disease have increased mortality .12,43,45,51 1.1.2. Treatment Options Current treatment options for PsA include conventional therapies such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), intra-articular corticosteroid injections, low -dose systemic steroids, oral disease -modify ing antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs; eg, methotrexate [MTX], sulfasalazine [SSZ], and leflunomide [L EF]), and immunosuppressive drugs (eg, cy closporine A, tacrolimus). The addition of biologic treatments for PsA, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitors (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab ), ustekinumab, an IL-12/IL -23 inhibitor, and secukinumab (an IL-17 inhibitor) significantly improved skin and joint responses in patients when used on top of conventional DMARDS or alone . Apremilast, a new oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, is also available for the treatment of PsA; however, its use is associated with less degree of skin and joint improvements compared with biologic treatments. Despite these recent advances in treatment options for PsA, there remains an unmet medical need for novel therapeutic agents that address the heterogeneous clinical manifestations of PsA and offer an improved benefit/risk profile for the individual patient.

Phase 2 Study in Psoriatic A rthritis (CNTO1959PSA 2001) Study Design CNTO1959PSA2001 is a Phase 2a, multicenter, randomi zed, double -blind, placebo- controlled, study evaluating the efficacy and safet y of guselkumab in subjects with active PsA and ≥3% body surface area (BSA) of plaque psoriasis despite current or previous treatment with standard -of-care therapies, including those previously exposed to anti-TNF αagents. In this study , 149 subjects with active PsA were randomized in a 1:2 ratio to receive either placebo or guselkumab 100 mg SC at Weeks 0, 4, then every 8 w eeks (q8w) through Week 44. At Week 16, subjects in both treatment groups who had <5% improvement from baseline in both tender and swollen joint counts qualified for early escape and switched to open -label therapy with ustekinumab. At Week 24, subjects remaining in the placebo group crossed over to receive guselkumab 100 mg at Weeks 24, 28, then q8w through Week 44. All subjects will have a final follow -up visit at Week 56. Preliminary efficacy , safety and PK results through Week 24 are summarized below: Efficacy Results The study met its primary and all secon dary endpoints. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects who achieved an American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 response at Week 24, and was significantly higher in the guselkumab group (58.0%) compared with the placebo group (18.4%, p<0.001) . In addition, significantly more guselkumab subjects achieved ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses, and PASI 50, PASI 75, and PASI 90 responses at Week 24 compared with the placebo group (Table 2).Significant treatment effect on ACR 20 response was observed as early as Week 4 (21% vs 0, p<0.001), and the effect increased over time reaching the maximum by Week 16 (60.0% vs. 16.3%, p<0 .001) versus placebo. Other secondary efficacy endpoints are summarized in Table 2.These results demonstrated that treatment with guselkumab signific antly improved joint symptoms, physical function, psoriasis, enthesitis, dacty litis and quality of life in this population.

No deaths, malignancies, anaphy lactic or serum sickness - like reactions were reported in the study through Week 24. Infections (as assessed by the investigators) were comparable between the placebo (20.4%) and guselkumab (16.0%) groups. Infections reported by >1 subject in the guselkumab group included nasophary ngitis (6 [6.0%]), gingivitis (2 [2.0%]) and urinary tract infection (2 [2.0%]). No serious infections, tuberculosis (TB) or opportunistic infections were reported through Week 24. The proportions of subjects with 1 or more infections requiring oral or parenteral antimicrobial treatment were similar between the placebo (14.3%) and guselkumab (10.0%) groups. Overall, there were no clinically important findings for hematology or chemistry laboratory parameters. Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicit y Results Steady state of serum guselkumab concentration was achieved by approximately Week 20 following SC administrations of 100 mg guselkumab at Week 0 and 4, and q8w thereafter. The median stead y-state trough serum guselkumab concentration at Week 20 w as 0.93 µg/mL , which is similar to those observed in Phase 3 studies in subjects with psoriasis. Only one subject (1%, 1/100) was positive for antibodies to guselkumab through Week 24 with low antibody titers (1:20). Conclusions In subjects with active PsA who had ≥3% BSA involvement of psoriasis, guselkumab demonstrated robust efficacy across all efficacy endpoints on joint signs and sy mptoms, phy sical function, skin disease, enthesitis, dacty litis, and health -related quality of life. Efficacy was generall y demonstrated both in subjects receiving MTX and in subjects not receiving MTX. Similarly , guselkumab 100 mg was well tolerated in the PsA population through Week 24 with no unexpected safet y findings. 1.1.3.2. Phase 2 Study in Psoriasis (CNTO1959PSO200 1, X- PLORE) Study Design In the X-PLORE study, 293 subjects with moderate to severe plaque -type psoriasis were randomized to receive 1 of 5 guselkumab SC dose regimens (5 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and then every 12 weeks [q12w], 15 mg q8w, 50 mg at Weeks 0, 4, andthen q12w, 100 mg q8w, or 200 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and then q12w), placebo, or adalimumab (HUMI RA®) 80 mg at Week 0, 40 mg at Week 1, and then 40 mg every 2 weeks (q2w). Efficacy Results The proportions of subjects who achieved a Physician’s Global Assessme nt (PGA) score of cleared (0) or minimal (1) were significantl y higher at Week 16 in all guselkumab treatment groups compared with the placebo group. In addition, higher proportions of subjects in the guselkumab 50 mg q12w, 100 mg q8w, and 200 mg q12w groups achieved a PGA score of NCT03162796"

A dose -response in efficacy was observed up to 100 mg q8w; the proportions of subjects who achieved a PGA of 0 or 1 were similar in the 100 mg q8w and 200 mg q12w dose groups. Results for improvements in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI ) scores were generally similar to those observed for PGA. Safety Results Treatment with guselkumab was generally well-tolerated through Week 52. The proportions of subjects with 1 or more adverse events (AEs) were comparable across the combined guselkumab, placebo, and the adalimumab groups through Week 16, with no evidence of a dose-response in the occurrence of AEs across the guselkumab groups. Through Week 16, the proportion of subjects with 1 or more SAEs was low across all treatment groups. Two serious infections (appendicitis and lung abscess in the guselkumab 50 mg group), no malignancies, and no major cardiovascular events were reported. Similar patterns of AEs were observed through Week 52. Events of interest through Week 52 included the 2 serious infections noted through Week 16, 1malignancy (cervical dysplasia, including carcinoma in situ) in the 200 mg q12w group, and 3 major cardiovascular events (1 fatal myocardial infarction in the 5 mg q12w group and 1 nonfatal my ocardial infarction and 1 stroke, each in the 100 mg q8w group). Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity Results Approximate dose -proportionality in serum guselkumab concentrations through Week 52 was observed after multiple SC administrations at dose levels ranging from 15 mg to 200 mg. Steady state serum guselkumab concentrations were achieved by approximately Week 16 for both the q8w and q12w regimens. In each treatment group, mean or median trough serum guselkumab concentrations were maintained at stead y state through Week 40 (q8w groups) or Week 52 (q12w groups). There was no evidence of accumulation in serum guselkumab concentrations over time with SC q8w or q12w administrations. Serum guselkumab concentrations appeared to be affected by subject body weight; higher -weight subjects (>90 kg) had lower mean steady -state trough serum guselkumab concentrations compared with lower- weight subjects ( ≤90 kg). The overall incidence of antibodies to guselkum ab across all guselkumab treatment groups through Week 52 was 3.8%, with generall y low titers. None of the subjects who were positive for antibodies to guselkumab had antibodies that were able to neutralize the bioactivity of guselkumab in vitro. No consis tent impact of antibodies to guselkumab on serum guselkumab concentrations was observed across the guselkumab treatment groups. Conclusions Treatment with guselkumab was well tolerated across a wide range of doses and led to substantial, clinically meaning ful improvements in psoriasis, with several dose regimens y ielding superior outcomes to those observed with adalimumab.

Role of Interleukin- 23 and TH17 Pathway s in the Treatment of Psoriatic A rthritis Interleukin (IL)-23 is a member of the IL-12 family of heterodimeric cytokines. IL-23 shares the p40 subunit with IL-12. However, in contrast to IL-12, which is formed from p40/p35 heterodimers, the p40 subunit is paired with a p19 subunit to form IL-23.35 IL-23, alone or in combination with other cytokines (tran sforming growth factor -βand IL-6 or IL-1β), drives the expansion and/or maintenance of mouse and human CD4+ IL-17 producing T helper 17 (Th17) cells. Th17 cells produce downstream pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, IL-6, and TNFα.4,24,46 Inhibition of upstream signaling by IL-23 blockade is expected to interrupt Th17 pathway s that contribute to the chronic inflammation underly ing the pathophy siology of many immune mediated diseases37,44including PsA, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and axial spondyloarthritis. In addition, susceptibility to psoriasis, PsA, and inflammatory bow el disease has been shown to be associated with genetic polymorphisms in IL-23/IL-23R receptor components.1,6,25,34,36 In addition to the robust efficacy demonstrated in the treatment of psoriasis, biologic treatments targeting Th17 pathways, including ustekinumab, secukinumab, and ixekizumab, have been shown to induce rapid and significant improvement of arthritis and psoriasis in subjects with active PsA. The efficacy andsafet y of ustekinumab, a fully human IgG1κ that binds with high affinity and specificit y to the shared p40 subunit of both human IL -12 and IL -23, in subjects with active PsA have been demonstrated in 3 adequate, placebo -controlled studies (1Phase 2 study , C0743T1016; and 2 Phase 3 studies , CNTO1275PSA3001 [PSUMMI T1]22,27and CNTO1275PSA3002 [PSUMMI T240]). In the Phase 3 PsA studies FU TURE 128, FUTURE 232, and SPIRIT-P129, both secukinumab and ixekizumab, the 2 anti-IL17 agents, demonst rated significant reduction on signs and symptoms of PsA, improvement of physical function and inhibition of structural damage. The robust efficacy of the treatments targeting Th17 pathway s observed in both psoriasis and PsA, including that demonstrated byguselkumab across all efficacy endpoints in the Phase 2 PsA study (CNTO1959 PSA2001 ; Section 1.1.3.1 ),highlights the central role that IL- 23/IL-17 axis hasin the pathogenesis of both psoriasis and PsA .

43,page_43,"CNTO 1959 (guselkumab) Clinical Protocol CNTO1959PSA3001 Amendment 1 44 Approved, Date: 25 January 20181.2.2. Study Rationale Psoriatic arthritis is a multi -faceted disease that impacts the joints, soft tissues, and skin, all of which affect quality of life. Up to 42% of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis have PsA. There is often a medical need to have a single therapeutic agent to control both skin and joint psoriatic symptoms, as well as to control enthesitis, dact ylitis, and to prevent joint damage. Investigation of guselkumab in the current Phas e 3 PsA clinical study is supported by the following: Robust efficacy results and a favorable safet y profile from a Phase 2 study of guselkumab in PsA (Section 1.1.3.1 ), in which the primary and all secondary endpoints were met. Efficacy and safet y results of guselkumab observed in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in psoriasis including the subset of subjects with PsA (Sections 1.1.3.2 and 1.1.3.3 , respectivel y). The purpose of this study is to further define the clinical efficacy of guselkumab in the reduction of signs and s ymptoms and to evaluate the safet y profile of guselkumab in the treatment of PsA . 1.2.3. Dose Rationale Based upon guselkumab clinical efficacy , safety , PKdata, and exposure -response modeling analysis using data from the Phase 2 study (CNTO1959PSA2001) in subjects with PsA, 2 dose regimens have been chosen for evaluation in the guselkumab Phase 3 PsA program: 100 mg Weeks 0 and 4 then q8w 100 mg q4w The rationale for these dose regimens of guselkumab is presented below in Section 1.2.3.1 (100 mg Weeks 0 and4 then q8w) and Section 1.2.3.2 (100 mg q4w). 1.2.3.1. Rationale for Guselkumab 100 mg at Weeks 0 and 4 ,then Every 8Weeks Dose Regime n This dose regimen was evaluated in the Phase 2 PsA study (CNTO1959PSA2001) and in the 3 global Phase 3 studies in psoriasis. In the CNTO1959PSA2001 study , robust efficacy and clinically meaningful improvement was observed with this dose regimen in all important domains of PsA including joint signs and symptoms, physical function, psoriasis, enthesitis, dactylitis, and quality of life in patients with active PsA and ≥3% BSA of psoriasis (Section 1.1.3.1 ). Additionally , significant benefit was also observed with this dose regimen on plaque psoriasis in patients with moderate -to-severe psoriasis in the Phase 3 psoriasis studies (Section 1.1.3.3 ). PsA is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy which can result in irreversible structural damage of joints, therefore, rapid control of the disease is desired. An additional dose is being included at Week 4 to ensure that trough guselkumab levels do not fall below those obtained at stead y-state levels. This additional Week 4 dose results in a slightly higher Cmaxand Ctrough in the first 12 weeks than those at steady state (~21% and ~18%, respectivel y) and NCT03162796"
44,page_44,"CNTO 1959 (guselkumab) Clinical Protocol CNTO1959PSA3001 Amendment 1 45 Approved, Date: 25 January 2018may result in a more rapid onset of response. However, this dosing regimen is not expected to result in substantially higher levels of efficacy at Week 24 than would be achieved by q8w dosing during mainte nance, ie, from Week 24 and onwards. The safety of this dosing regimen has been established in a large psoriasis development program. Furthermore, the safet y profile in the Phase 2 studies in patients with PsA and RA is consistent with that seen in the p soriasis program. In summary , the efficacy and safet y data in both the PsA and psoriasis studies support further evaluation of this dose regimen in the Phase 3 PsA studies . 1.2.3.2. Rationale for Guselkumab 100 mg Every 4 Weeks Dose Regim en A dose regimen of 100 mg q4w is being included in this study in order to determine if more frequent dosing may achieve higher efficacy in PsA . Modeling analyses based on data from CNTO1959PSA2001 suggest that a higher or more frequent dose regimen may achieve better efficac y in PsA : Based on population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation , the 100mg q4w dose regimen was predicted to result in an approximately 4-fold higher median steady -state trough concentration (3.95 µg/mL ) compared to 100 m g q8w (0.99 µg/mL), and higher trough concentrations, may provide an opportunity to maximize efficacy in PsA. Anexposure -response modeling and simulation analy sis based on the data from CNTO1959PSA2001 predicted that the 100 mg q4w dose regimen could achieve higher efficacy (ie, ACR responses) in PsA patients at Week 16 compared with the q8w dose regimen. Conversel y, this analy sis showed that a lower dose regimen (50mgq8w) could have lower efficacy (ie, ACR responses) . Patients who have had inadequate response to anti-TNFα or other biologic treatments are more difficult to treat and may benefit from a higher dose.27 Treatment with the100 mg q4w dose regimen is expected to result in acceptable safet y based on the exposure -safety anal ysis in the Phase 3psoriasis program : No consistent pattern suggesting an association between sy stemic guselkumab exposure quartiles and the rates of occu rrence of SAEs or AEs leading to discontinuation was evident, with a possible exception of non-serious infections. Moreover, the clinical relevance of this finding appears to be limited, given that the vast majority of these non-serious infections were mild to moderate in intensity and that the frequency of the infections requiring treatment was generall y similar across all 4 exposure quartiles. Guselkumab has been shown to have an acceptable safet y profile in multiple patient populations, including with a higher dose regimen that was studied in a Phase 2 RA study (200 mg q8w). Therefore, guselkumab 100 mg q4w is expected to be well tolerated in the Phase 3 PsA population.

STUDY DESIGN A ND RA TIONA LE 3.1. Overview of Study Design This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 3-arm study of guselkumab in subjects with active PsA who had inadequate response to standard therapies (eg, non-biologic disease -modify ing antirheumatic drugs [DMARDs ], apremilast , or NSAI Ds). In addition, subjects (approximately 30%) may have been previously treated with up to 2 anti- TNF αagents. The study will include approximately 360 subjects. Stable dosesof concomitant NSAIDs, oralcorticosteroids, and selected non-biologic DMARDs (limited to MTX, SSZ, HCQ, and LEF) will be allowed (Table 3 ) but arenot required. The study consi sts of the following phases: a screening phase of up to 6 weeks a blinded treatment phase of approximately 1 year(ie, 52weeks), including a placebo- controlled period from Week 0 to Week 24 and an active treatment period from Week 24 to Week 52 . a safet y follow -up phase of 8weeks after Week 52. An overview of the stud y design is provided in Figure 1. At Week 0, approximately 360 subjects who satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of the following 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1ratio using permuted NCT03162796"

At Week 16, all subjects in Groups I, II, and IIIwith < 5% improvement from baseline in both tender and swollen joint counts will be considered as meeting early escape criteria. These subjects will remain on the dosing regimen they were randomized to at Week 0. A t Week 16, subjects who meet early escape criteria will be allowed to initiate or increase the dose of one of the permitted concomitant medications up to the maximum allowed dose as specified in Table 3 as selected by the investigator. Titration to a stable dose of themedication should be completed for subjects qualify ing for earl y escape b y the Week 24 visit. At Week 24, all subjects in the placebo group (Group III) will cross over to receive guselkumab 100 mg SC q4w through Week 52; this will allow for collection of additional safet y data forthe 100 mg SC q4w dose. Subjects in the guselkumab groups (Groups I and II) will remain on the dosing regimen they were randomized to at Week 0, through Week 52. Subjects will be followed for new AEs and SAEs up to 12 weeks following the last study agent administration. The end of the study is defined as the time the lastsubject completes the last study visit .For subjects who complete the Week 52visit, the last study visit is the Week 60 visit. For subjects who discontinue study agent prior to Week 52, the last study visit is the final safet y visit (12 weeks after the last study agent administration) . Database locks are scheduled at Weeks 24 and End of Study (Week 60). The first DBL will occur when all randomized subjects have either completed the Week 24 assessments or terminated study participation prior to the Week 24 visit (referred to as Week 24 DBL). The second DBL will occur when all randomized subjects have either completed their final safety visit or have terminated study participation (referred to as Final DBL) . An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be established to monitor unblinded data on an ongoing basis through at least theWeek 24 DBL to ensur e the continuing safet y of the subjects enrolled in this study .Refer to Section 11.11 for further detail. Samples for the anal ysis of pharmacody namic biomarkers will be collected from all subjects. A pharmacogenomic blood sample will be collected from subjects who consent separately to this component of the study where local regulations permit.

Study Population The target study population is subjects with active PsA who have had inadequate response to standard therapies (eg, non-biologic DMARDs, apremilast or NSAIDs). In addition, approximately 30% of the study population may have been previously exposed to up to 2anti-TNFα agent s. Stable dosesof concomitant NSAI Ds, oral corticosteroids, and selected non-biologic DMARDs (limited to MTX, SSZ, HCQ, or LEF) will be allowed but arenot required. This population is considered appropriate to provide relevant efficacy and safet y information for the intended use of guselkumab in PsA. 3.2.2. Study Control, Randomization, and Blinding A placebo control will be used to establish the frequency and magnitude ofchanges in endpoints that may occur in the absence of active treatment.

51,page_51,"CNTO 1959 (guselkumab) Clinical Protocol CNTO1959PSA3001 Amendment 1 52 Approved, Date: 25 January 2018Randomization will be used to minimize bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment groups, to increase the likelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (eg,demographic and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. Blinded treatment will be used to reduce potential bias during data collection and evaluation of clinic al endpoints. 3.2.3. Study Phases and Duration of Treatment There will be 4 phases in this study : screening, double -blind placebo -controlled, active treatment, and safet y follow -up. The screening phase of up to 6 weeks will allow for sufficient time to perform screening study evaluations and determine study eligibility . The second phase of the study will be the double -blind, placebo -controlled phase from Week 0 to Week 24.The primary endpoint is evaluated at Week 24 as guselkumab is expected to achieve maximal efficacy between Weeks 20 to 24of treatment based on the findings in the guselkumab Phase 2 study (CNTO1959PSA2001) in PsA . The third phase of the study will be thedouble -blind active treatment phase from Week 24 through Week 52.This duration will provide adequate time to evaluate the maintenance of the efficacy and long -term safet y of guselkumab in PsA over a 1 -year exposure period. The fourth phase of the study will be the safet y follow -up phase (Week 52 to 60) and will be 12 weeks from the last administration of study agent (at Week 48) to the final safet y follow -up visit. The safety follow -up allows for monitoring of the subjects for a period equivalent to approximately 5 times the half -life of guselkumab. The placebo -control led period is limited to 24 weeks. An early escape option is included in the study design to provide additional treatment options for subjects who have <5% improvement in swollen and tender joint counts at Week 16. 3.2.4. Study Evaluations Efficacy evaluations chosen for this study were established in previous studies of therapeutic biologic agents for the treatment of PsA. Patient reported outcomes (PROs) chosen for this study are also consistent with clinically relevant measurements that are accepted in the medical literature for other studies in PsA and applicable United States/European Union regulatory guidance documents. Subjects will be monitored closel y for safet y with visits at the clinical site as described in the Time and Events Schedule (Table 1) while on therap y. Safet y monitoring will include collecting information on AEs, review of concomitant medications, vital signs, laboratory assessments, physical exams, and early detection of TB as described in Section 9.4. Safety data will be reviewed by the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor on an ongoing basis. An independent DMC composed of clinicians and statisticians not associated with the conduct of the study will review unbli nded study data for safet y purposes on a periodic basis through at least the Week 24 DBL.

52,page_52,"CNTO 1959 (guselkumab) Clinical Protocol CNTO1959PSA3001 Amendment 1 53 Approved, Date: 25 January 2018Serum samples will be collected to evalu ate the PK of guselkumab, as well as the immunogenicit y of guselkumab (antibodies to guselkumab) as described in the Time and Events Schedule ( Table 1). DNA and Biomarker Collection It is recognized that genetic variation can be an important contributory factor to interindividual differences in drug distribution and response and can also serve as a marker for disease susceptibility and prognosis. Pharmacogenomic research may help to explain interindividual variability in clinical outcomes and may help to identify population subgroups that respond differentl y to a drug. The goal of the pharmacogenomic component is to collect deox yribonucleic acid (DNA )to allow the identification of genetic factors that may influence efficacy of guselkumab and to identify genetic factors associated with PsA. Biomarker samples will be collected to better understand the biology of PsA, to provide a biological assessment of the response of patients to treatment with guselkumab, to analyze differences between responders and non-responders, and to determine if the markers can be used to classify patients as potential responders prior to treatment. The goal of the biomarker anal yses is to evaluate the pharma codynamics of guselkumab and aid in evaluating the drug-clinical response relationship. DNA and biomarker samples may be used to help address emerging issues and to enable the development of safer, more effective, and ultimately individualized therapies. 4.

At Week 0, subjects will be randomly assigned (1:1:1 ) to 1 of 3treatment groups (guselkumab 100 mg q4w, guselkumab 100 mg Weeks 0, 4 then q8w, or placebo) based on a computer -generated randomization schedule prepared before the study by or under the supervision of the Sponsor. Permuted block randomization with stratification by baseline non-biologic DMARD (MTX, SSZ, HCQ, LEF) use (yes / no) and by prior exposure to anti-TNFα agen ts (yes/no) will be used. The interactive web response system (IWRS) will assign a unique treatment code, which will dictate the treatment assignment and matching study agent kit for the subject. Therequestor must use his or her own user identification and personal identification number when contacting the IWRS and will then give the relevant subject details to uniquely identify the subject.

Each unit will be uniquely identifiable through a medication number. A tear-off label is designed to be torn off, separated from the study agent container, and attached to the subject's source documents. The label will not identify the study agent in the container. However, if it is necessary for a subject's safet y, the study blind may be broken and the identity of the study agent ascertained. The study agent number will be entered in the case report form (CRF) when the study agent is administered. The study agents will be identical in appearance and will be packaged in identical containers. The investigator will not be provided with randomization codes. The codes will be maintained within the IWRS, which has the functionality to allow the investigator to break the blind for an individual subject . In general, randomization codes will be disclosed fully only if the study is completed and the clinical database is closed. Under normal circumstances, the blind should not be broken for individual subjects until the End of Study DBL of the study . Otherwise, the blind should be broken only ifspecific emergency treatment/course of action would be dictated by knowing the treatment status of the subject. In the event of an emergency , the investigator may determine the identity of the treatment from IWRS. It is recommended that the investigator contact the Sponsor or its designee if possible to discuss the particular situation, before breaking the blind. Telephone c ontact with the Sponsor or its designee will be available 24 hours per day , 7 day s per week. In the event the blind is broken, the Sponsor must be informed as soon as possible. The date and reason for the unblinding must be documented by site personnel in the appropriate section of thecase report form (CRF ) and in the source document. The investigator is also advised not to reveal the study treatment assignment to the stud y site or Sponsor personnel. Subjects who have had their treatment assignment unblinded are expected to continue to return for scheduled evaluations. Further study agent administrations should be discussed with the study responsible physician. At the Week 24 DBL, the data will be unblinded for analy sis to some Sponsor personnel while subjects are still participating in the study . Identification of Sponsor personnel who will have access to the unblinded subject -level data will be documented prior to unblinding . Investigative study sites and subjects will remain blinded to initial treatment assignment until after the final database is locked. Data that may potentially unblind the treatment assignment (ie, study agent serum concentrations, antibodies to study agent, treatment allocation) will be handled with special care so that, prior to unblinding, such data will only be available to data management staff for purposes of data cleaning and, if applicable, clinical pharmacology representatives for the purposes of performing PKand antibodies to guselkumab analyses and quality assuranc e representatives for the purposes of conducting independent drug audits. A given subject’s treatment assignment may be unblinded to the Sponsor, Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC), and site personnel to fulfill regulatory reporting requirements .

Study agent will be admi nistered at the site by a health care professional (HCP) until the subject (or caregiver) is trained for self-administration. Study agent will be administered by site personnel at Weeks 0 and 4.Beginning at Week 8, at the discretion of the investigator and subject, and after appropriate and documented training, subjects may self-administer study agent at the investigative site under the supervision of an HCP. A caregiver may also be trained to administer study agent. Subjects unable or unwilling to self-administer will continue to have study agent injections performed by an HCP. The option to begin self-administration of study agent at home will begin at Week 32. At Week 28, subjects (or a caregiver) who are able to self-administer will be supplied study agent for self -administration away from the site (ie, at home). Subjects will be instructed to contact the investigator promptl y in the event of any signs of an allergic reaction, infection, or bleeding. Subjects unable or unwilling to have injection (s)administered away from site will be required to return to the site for administration of study agent injection(s) by an HCP . After Week 28, subjects will have study visits and assessments approximately every 8 weeks through Week 52. Through Week 24,study agent administration at the site should be ±4 days from the scheduled dayof study agent administration; after Week 24all administrations should be ±7 days from scheduled study agent administration day.Study agent administrations must alway s be at least 14 days apart. The dose regimens are as follows: Group I(n=120): Subjects will receive SC guselkumab 100 mg q4w from Week 0 through Week 48; Group II (n=120): Subjects will receive SC guselkumab 100 mg at Weeks 0and4, then q8w (at Weeks 12, 20, 28, 36, 44 ) and placebo injections at other visits (Weeks 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48) to maintain the blind . Group III(n=120): Subjects will receive SC placebo q4w from Week 0 to Week 20, and will cross over at Week 24 to receive SC guselkumab 100 mg q4w from Week 24 through Week 48. At Week 16, a ll subjects inGroups I, II and III with <5% improvement from baseline in both tender and swollen joint counts will be considered as meeting early escape criteria.

TREA TMENT COMPLIA NCE Study agent will be administered at the investigational site through Week 28 and study personnel will maintain a log of all study agent administrations. Study agent supplies for each subject will be inventoried and accounted for. All ongoing therapies administer ed at the time of screening must be recorded. Subjects will receive instructions on compliance with study treatment when they begin self-administration of study agent at home. When subjects begin self-administration at home, the investigator or designated study personnel will maintain a log of all study agent dispensed and returned. When study agent is self-administered by subjects at home, subjects will record all study agent administrations on a diary card. During the course of the study , the investigato r or designated study research personnel will be responsible for providing additional instruction to reeducate any subject who is not compliant with taking the stud y agent. Compliance with the treatment schedule is strongl y encouraged. It is understood that treatment may be interrupted for health -related or safety reasons. Therefore, if for any reason a subject cannot receive a dose of study agent at the scheduled visit, the subject must make every effort to still come infor the scheduled assessments at that visit. The dose should be administered within 2 weeks of that scheduled visit. The subject should then resume the normal study schedule relative to the baseline visit (Week 0).In the case when a subject does not come into the investigational site for a scheduled visit, the site will follow -up with that subject. Due diligence could include telephone calls, certified letters, and email requests. Measures taken to obtain follow -up information must be documented. Study -site personnel will keep a log of all study agent dispensed and will compare the amount of study drug dispensed with the amount returned. Additional details may be provided in the Site Investigational Product Manual that is provided separately and n oted in Section 15. Through Week 24, study visits will have a visit window of ±4days. After Week 24, study visits at the site will have a visit window of ±7 days. TheWeek 60 visit or the safet y visit (12 weeks after the last dose in subjects who discontinue study treatment) willhave a visit window of ±14 days. If a study visit occurs outside this window, the Sponsor should be consulted about how the subject should resume his or her normal dose schedule. Information regarding study agent administrations that are administered outside of the scheduled windows or missed will be recorded. Subject charts and worksheets may be reviewe dand compared wit h the data entries on the CRFs to ensure accuracy . 8.

For women of childbearing potential only, additional serum or urine pregnancy tests may be performed, as determined necessary by the investigator or required by local regulation, to establish the absence of pregnancy at any time during the subject's participation in the study . Also additional TB tests may be perfo rmed as determined necessary by the investigator or required b y local regulation. Except at the screening visit, all PRO assessments should be conducted/completed before any tests, procedures, or other consultations at all other visits as specified in the Time and Events Schedule to prevent influencing subject perceptions. For additional details, and the order for which they are to be performed, refer to the PRO user manuals. NCT03162796"

Study -site personnel will train the subjects on how to use the electronic device, including instructions to capture the data according to the stud y design. 9.1.2. Blood Sample Collection Blood samples should be collected at the visits indicated in the Time and Events Schedule. The date and time of collection will be recorded. When blood samples are to be collected for safet y, PK, efficacy , biomarkers, and pharmacogenomics/epigenetic evaluations at the same time point, the order of blood draws will be samples for: CRP, chemistry/lipids, hematology , PK/I mmunogenicit y, serum biomarkers, pharmacogenomics, epigenetics, and RNA expression. The total blood volume to be collected in this study from each subject will be approximately 269 m L.Subjects who consent to participate in the optional pharmacogenomics will have an additional blood volume collected of approximately 40 mL, for a total of approximately 309mL. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safet y reasons or for technical issues with the samples . 9.1.3. Screening Phase Screening procedures will be performed as indicated in the Time and Events Schedule. After written informed consent has been obtained and within a period of 6 weeks before randomization, all screening evaluations will be performed. The screening visit may be completed in a single visit or may be divided into more than 1 visit. It is recommended that after obtaining informed consent, the investigator may complete all laboratory tests at the first visit. The subject may then return for the remainder of the screening procedures onl y if the subject is eligible for the study as determined by the central laboratory test results. Subjects who meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be enr olled in the study . Subjects who choose to participate in the optional pharmacogenomics research component of the stud y must provide consent on a separate ICF. The recording of AEs and concomitant medications will start after the signing of the informed consent and will continue until the last study -related procedure has been completed. If the screening visit is a single visit, the electronic Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (eC-SSRS ; Lifetime version ) should be performed after the joint assessment (after signing informed consent). If the screening visit is divided into more than 1 visit, the eC -SSRS should be performed after thejoint assessment and thesubject is determined to be eligible by the central laboratory test results. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to randomization and a negative urine pregnancy test at all dosing visits prior to administration of study agent.

The methods of contraception used by each subject must be documented. For details, see Section 4.1. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed locally at baseline prior toadministration of study agent to ensure that,should the subject require an ECG during the study for any reason, an ECG before first study agent administration is available for comparison to detect changes. A chest radiograph (posterior -anterior view) will be performed at screening to ensure that the subject does not have any abnormality suggestive of current, active TB or old, inactive TB. Chest radiographs taken up to 3 months before the first administration of study agent may be used. The BASDAI will be completed only in subjects with spondy litis with peripheral arthritis as their primary arthritic presentation of PsA (confirmation of sacroiliitis should be performed at the screening visit by the investigator, with evidence of spondy litis from a prior pelvic or SI joint x-ray or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI )when available. Results must be documented.) Subje cts as outlined inInclusion Criterion 15must undergo testing for TB (Attachment 2or Attachment 3) and their medical history assessment must include specific questions about a history of TBor known occupational or other personal exposure to individuals with active TB. The subject should be asked about past testing for TB, including chest radiograph results and responses to tuberculin skin or other TB testing. Investigators have the option to use both the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test and the tuberculin skin test to screen for latent TB if they believe, based on their judgment, that the use of both tests is clinically indicated in order to evaluate a subject who has high risk of having latent TB.If either the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test or the tuberculin skin test is positive, the subject is considered to have latent TB infection for the purposes of eligibility for this study . Subjects with a negative QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test result (and a negative tuberculin skin test result in countries in which the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test is not approved/registered* or the tuberculin skin test is mandated by local health authorities) are eligible to continue with pre-randomization procedures. *Exceptions are made for those countries where the tuberculin skin test is not feasible due to various reasons (eg, shortage of test reagents) with the permission of respective health authorities, as applicable. Subjects with a newly identified positive QuantiFERON®-TB Gold or tuberculin skin test result must undergo an evaluation to rule out active TB and initiate appropriate treatment for latent TB. Appropriate treatment for latent TB is defined according to local country guidelines f or immunocompromised patients. If no local country guidelines for immunocompromised patients exist, United States guidelines must be followed, or the subject will be excluded from the stud y. NCT03162796"

In the event that the second QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test result is also indeterminate, the subject may be enrolled without treatment for latent TB if active TB is ruled out, their chest radiograph shows no abnormality suggestive of TB (active or old,inactive TB), and the subject has no additional risk factors for TB as determined by the investigator. This determination must be promptly reported to the Sponsor’s medical monitor and recorded in the subject's source documents and initialed by the invest igator. Subjects will undergo screening for HBV ( Attachment 4) and antibodies to HCV and HIV. Retesting The re-testing of abnormal screening laboratory blood tests and CRP levels, which are exclusionary , is allowed only once using an unscheduled visit during the screening period (to reassess eligibility ). Repeat Screening If a subject was a screen failure in the past but currently the subject is expected to be able to meet the subject eligibility criteria, the subject may be screened again on one occasion only after consultation with the Sponsor (ie, study responsible physician, scientist, or designee ). For the second screening, the subject will be assigned a new subject number, and must undergo the informed consent process and all other screening procedu res again as in the Time and Events Schedule. Chest x -rays, if done within the specified allowed time, are not required to be repeated. If the QFT and/or TST ispositive in the first screening, these tests should not be repeated. Also if the QFT and TST w ere done within the specified allowed time, they should not be repeated . 9.1.4. Treatment Phase The treatment phase includes the placebo -controlled and active treatment phases. At Week 0, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 treatments: guselkumab SC 100 mg q4w, guselkumab SC 100 mg at Weeks 0, 4 then q8w, or placebo SC. For additional details, see Section 6. Safet y and efficacy assessments must be performed before study agent administration as noted in the Time and Events Schedule. Early Detection of Active Tuberculosis To aid in the early detection of TB reactivation or new TB infection during study participation, subjects must be evaluated for signs and symptoms of active TB at scheduled visits (refer to Time and Events Schedule) or by telephone contact approximately every 8 to 12 weeks if a subject misses scheduled visits. The following series of questions is suggested for use during the evaluation: “Have you had a new cough of >14 day s’ duration or a change in a chronic cough?” “Have you had an y of the following s ymptoms: NCT03162796"

If the evaluation raises suspicion that a subject may have TB reactivation or new TB infection, an immedia te and thorough investigation should be undertaken, including, where possible, consultation with a phy sician specializing in TB. Investigators should be aware that TB reactivation in immunocompromised subjects may present as disseminated disease or with extrapulmonary features. Subjects with evidence of active TB should be referred for appropriate treatment. Subjects who experience close contact with an individual with active TB during the conduct of the study must have a repeat chest radiograph, a repeat QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test, a repeat tuberculin skin test in countries in which the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test is not approved/registered or the tuberculin skin test is mandated by local health authorities, and, if possible, referral to a physician specializing in TB to determine the subject’s risk of developing active TB and whether treatment for latent TB is warranted. If the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test result is indeterminate, the test should be repeated as outlined in Section 9.1.3 . Subjects should be encouraged to return for all subsequent scheduled study visits according to the protocol . Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale At all post-baseline visits except during screening , the eC-SSRS (Since Last Contact version) should be the first assessment/questionnaire that the subject must complete. 9.1.5.

Efficacy Evaluations Efficacy assessments will be perfor med at the site by applicable site personnel trained by the Sponsor a s indicated in the Time and Events Schedule. 9.2.1. Psoriatic A rthritis Response Evaluations 9.2.1.1. Joint Assessments Each of 68 joints will be evaluated for tenderness, and each of 66 joints will be evaluated for swelling (hips are excluded for swelling). An independent joint assessor (IJA) with adequate training and experience in performing joint assessments will be designated at each study site to perform all joint assessments. The IJA should prefer ably be a rheumatologist but if a rheumatologist is not available, it should be a health care provider with at least 1 year of experience in performing joint assessments. Health care providers with less than 1 year of experience may serve as an IJA based upon the discretion and approval of the Sponsor. It is strongl y recommended that the designated IJA identify an appropriate back -up IJA for coverage in the event of absences of the designated IJA. It is strongl y recommended that the same IJA who performs the baseline joint assessments for a subject should also perform the joint assessments for that subject at every subsequent visit through Week 52. Through Week 60, the IJA should have no other contact with the subject once the subject is randomized, should not be the treating physician, should not discuss the subject’s clinical status with the subject or other site personnel during the joint assessment, and will not be permitted to review the subject’s medical records or the CRFs, or any of the previous joint assessments or enthesitis/dacty litis assessments . The IJA should maintain a neutral attitude during joint/enthesitis/dacty litis assessment sand should limit interactions with the subject only to activities associated with performing assessment. The IJA will perform only joint, enthesitis, and dacty litis assessments; this individual will not perform or assist in any other assessments in this study such as but not limited to administering patient and/or ph ysician global assessments or administering study agent. The Sponsor will provide training for each site’s designated I JA prior to the screening of the first subject at each site. A back -up IJA must complete training before performing a joint assessment for a subject’s study visit. NCT03162796"

Training documentation of each I JA should be maintained at the study site. All IJA performing the joint evaluation at a site must be listed on the Delegation L og at the study site. 9.2.1.2. Nonevaluable Joints While it may be reason able in clinical practice to identify as nonevaluable any joint which in the past or during study participation has been surgically altered (ie, prosthesis placement) or medically treated (ie, intra-articular injection), the designation of nonevaluable joints for the purposes of this study is slightly different. Joints should only be designated as “non -evaluable” by the IJA if it is physically impossible to assess the joint (ie, joint inaccessible due to a cast, joint not present due to an amputation, or a recent wound near or at the joint so as to make it impossible to assess). In all other cases, the IJA should assess each joint for tenderness and swelling (hips are excluded for swelling). This should be completed regardless of any visual indications of prior surgeries (eg, scars) or knowledge they may have of a subject’s prior joint procedures/injections (eg, if the subject was the IJA’s patient prior to study participation). 9.2.1.3. American College of Rheumatology Responses American College of Rheumatology responses are presented as the numerical measurement of improvement in multiple disease assessment criteria. For example, an ACR 20 response 7is defined as: 1.≥20% improvement from baseline in both swollen joint count (66 joints) and tender joint count (68 joints), AND 2. ≥20% improvement from baseline in 3 of the following 5 assessments: Patient’s assessment of pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Patient’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (arthritis, VAS) Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity (VAS) Patient’s assessment of phy sical function as measured by HAQ -DI CRP ACR 50 and ACR 70 similarly defined except improvement threshold from baseline is 50% and 70%, respectively .

Disability Index of the Health A ssessment Questionnaire The functional status of the subject will be assessed by the HAQ- DI.9This 20-question instrument assesses the degree of difficult y a person has in accomplishing tasks in 8 functional areas (dres sing, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reaching, gripping, and activities of daily living). Responses in each functional area are scored from 0, indicating no difficulty , to 3, indicating inability to perform a task in that area (ie, lower scores are indicative of better functioning). Properties of the assessment have been evaluated and its validity in PsA has been determined.21 It has also been shown to be responsive to changes in a subject’s disease .30 In PsA, a decrease in score of 0.35 has been determined to indicate a meaningful improvement.31 9.2.1.7.

A subject is considered a responder if they have improvement in at least 2 of the following criteria, including at least one of the joint criteria and with no deterioration in the other criteria38: ≥ 30% decrease in the swollen joint count (66 joints) ; ≥ 30% decrease in the tender joint count (68 joints) ; ≥ 20% improvement in the patient's overall assessment of disease (arthritis) on a VAS ; and ≥ 20% improvement in the phy sician ’s overall assessment of disease on a VAS . 9.2.1.13. Bath A nkylosing Spondylitis Disease A ctivity Index The BASDAI was developed as a subject self-assessment for anky losing spondylitis that consists of 6 questions relating to the 5 major symptoms of ankylosing spondy litis.10 Only subject swith spondy litis with peripheral arthritis as their primary arthritic presentation of PsA will complete the BASDAI using a 10-unit VAS to indicate the degree of their symptoms over the past week on the following criteria: NCT03162796"

Higher scores indicate greater disease severit y and a score decrease of 50% or 2 points is considered clinically meaningful (49).53 9.2.2. Psoriasis Response Evaluations 9.2.2.1. Investigator’s Global A ssessment of Psoriasis The IGA documents the investigator’s assessment of the subject’s psoriasis at a given time point . Overall lesions are graded for induration, erythema, and scaling using 0 (no evidence), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate) and 4 (severe) scale . The IGA score of psoriasis isbased upon theaverage of induration, erythema and scaling scores. The patient’s psoriasis is assessed as clear ed(0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), or severe (4). Every effort should be made to ensure that the physician or designee who performed the IGA evaluations for a subject at baseline sho uld also perform the IGAevaluations for the subject at all subsequent visits through Week 52. The Sponsor will provide IGA training. Documentation of this training will be maintained in the site’s training files. Previous IGA training by the Sponsor withi n the last 3 y ears with adequate documentation (eg, training certification) will be considered adequate for this study ; however, repeat training prior to start of the study is encouraged. 9.2.2.2. Psoriasis A rea and Severity Index The PASI is a system used for assessing and grading the severit y of psoriatic lesions and their response to therapy .8 The PASI produces a numeric score that can range from 0 to 72. A PASI 75 response is defined as ≥75% improvement in PASI score from baseline; PASI 90 and PASI 100 are similarly defined. Every effort should be made to ensure that the physician or designee who performed the PASI evalua tions for a subject at baseline should also perform the PASI evaluations for the subject at all subsequent visits through Week 52. The Sponsor will provide PASI training. Documentation of this training will be maintained in the site’s training files. Previ ous PASI training by the Sponsor within the last 3 years with adequate documentation (eg, training certification) will be considered adequate for this study ; however, repeat training prior to start of the study is encouraged. 9.2.3. Other Patient Reported Outcome s 9.2.3.1. 36-Item Short -form Health Survey The SF-36questionnaire was developed as part of the Rand Health Insurance Experiment and consists of 8 multi -item domain scales: NCT03162796"

These scales are scored from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better health. Another algorithm yields 2 summary scores, the PCS and the MCS . These summary scores are also sca led with higher scores indicating better health but are scored using a norm -based sy stem where linear transformations are performed to transform scores to a mean of 50 and standard deviations of 10, based upon general US population norms.49 It has been demonstrated in a study of patients with RA that a change of 4.4 in PCS and 4.7 in MCS was the minimally important change.23There is no specific cut-off for a clinically meaningful change in patients with PsA and a conservative threshold of ≥5 points change in both PCS and MCS have been used in the clinical studies to define clinicall y meaningful improvement for various diseases. The concepts measured by the SF-36 are not specific to any age, disease, or treatment group, allowing comparison of relative burden of different diseases and the relative benefit of different treatments.50 9.2.3.2. Functional A ssessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Fatigue Fatigue has been identified as an important s ymptom and a unique concept in addition to the core disease measures of patients with PsA.3The FACIT- Fatigue questionnaire consists of 13 questions that assess a subject’s level of fatigue and tiredness over the last 7 day s. Each question is graded on a 5 -point scale (0 = not at all; 1 =a little bit; 2 = somewhat; 3 = quite a bit; 4 = very much); accordingl y, scores can range from 0 to 52. Lower scores reflect more severe fatigue. Although not developed for PsA, FACIT -Fatigue has demonstrated strong internal consistency and test-test reliability . It distinguishes between healthy and PsA patients and is correlated with swollen joint count and activel y inflamed joint count. In rheumatology , a change of 4points is considered meaningful and has been used in the PsA population.2 9.2.3.3. Patient -Reported Outcome s Measurement Information Sy stem- 29 Patient- Reported Outcome sMeasurement Information System (PROMIS )-29 profile instrument is intended for adults (ages 18+).26It is a collection of short forms containing 4 items for each of seven PROMI S domains (Depression, Anxiety , Physical Function, Pain Interference, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, and Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities). PROMI S-29 also includes an additional pain intensity 0-10 numeric rating scale . The PROMI S-29 Profile is universal rather than disease -specific. They assess all domains over the past seven days except for Physical Function which has no timeframe specified. The raw score of each domain is converted into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) NCT03162796"

The standardized T-score is reported as the final score for each participant. Pain Intensity is presented as raw responses (0-10). For PROMIS domains of Depression, Anxiety , Physical Function, Pain Interference, Fatigue, a score of 50 is the average for the United States general population with a standard deviation of 10,because testing was performed on a large sample of the general population. However, the other two domains (Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities and Sleep Disturbance) were not centered in a national sample. For these two domains, a score of 50 represents the average of the calibration sample which was generall y more enriched for chronic illness, and a score of 50 likely represents somewhat sicker people than the general population. A higher PROMI S T-score represents more of the concept being measu red. For negativel y-worded concepts like Anxiety , a T-score of 60 is one SD worse than average. By comparison, an Anxiety T-score of 40 is one SD better than average. However, for positively -worded concepts like Physical Function, a T-score of 60 is better than average while a T -score of 40 is better. 9.3. Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity Serum samples will be used to evaluate the PK of guselkumab as well as the immunogenicity of guselkumab (antibodies to guselkumab). Serum collected for PK and immunogenicit yanaly ses may additionally be used to evaluate safet y or efficacy aspects that address concerns arising during or after the study period. Genetic analyses will not be performed on these serum samples. Subject confidentiality will be maintained. 9.3.1. Serum Colle ction and Handling Venous blood samples will be collected at the time points shown in the Time and Events Schedule for the determination of serum guselkumab concentrations and antibodies to guselkumab. Serum samples will also be collected at the final visit from subjects who terminate study participation early. At visits where PK and immunogenicit y will be evaluated, 1 blood draw of sufficient volume can be used. Each sample will be split into 3 aliquots (1 aliquot for serum guselkumab concentration, 1 aliquot for antibodies to study agent, and 1 aliquot as a back -up). Samples must be collected before study agent administration at visits when a study agent administration is scheduled. The exact dates and times of blood sample collection must be recorded in the laboratory requisition form. A random venous blood sample for population PK analy sis will be collected from all subjects on any day between Weeks 4 to 12, except on the days of the scheduled study visit at Weeks 4, 8, and 12. Additionally , this blood sample must be collected at least 24 hours prior to or after the actual time of study agent administration at Weeks 4, 8, or 12. Each population PK serum sample will be split into 2 aliquots (1 aliquot for serum guselkumab concentration and 1 aliquot as a back -up sample). Additional information about the collection, handling, and shipment of biological samples can be found in the Laboratory Manual. NCT03162796"

Analytical Procedures Serum samples will be analyzed to determine serum guselkumab concentrations using a validated, specific, and sensitive immunoassay method by the Sponsor’s bioanaly tical facility or under the supervision of the Sponsor. The Sponsor, or its designee, under conditions in which the subjects’ identity remains blinded, will assay these sample s. 9.3.3. Pharmacokinetic Parameters If feasible, the apparent total systemic clearance and apparent volume of distribution of guselkumab will be estimated using a nonlinear mixed -effects modeling approach. 9.3.4. Immunogenicity Assessments Antibodies to guselkumab will be detected using a validated immunoassay method in serum samples collected from all subjects according to the Time and Events Schedule. Serum samples that test positive for antibodies to guselkumab will be further characterized to determine if antibodies to guselkumab could neutralize the biological effects of guselkumab in vitro (ie, neutralizing antibodies [NAbs] to guselkumab). All samples will be tested by the Sponsor or Sponsor's designee. 9.4. Safety Evaluations Safety assessments will be collected for all subjects as indicated in the Time and Events Schedule. The safety and tolerability of study agent (guselkumab and placebo) will be monitored by collecting information on AEs, including injection site and allergic reactions, clinical laboratory tests, physical examinations, vital signs, eC-SSRS questionnaires, concomitant medication review, and early detection of TB, as specified in the Time and Events Schedule. Serum and/or plasma samples collected for PK or PD analyses may also be used to evaluate safet y concerns that may arise during or after the stud y period. Details regarding the independent DMC are provided in the DMC Charter. Safety will be monitored through Week 60. Any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study must be rec orded on the AE section of the CRF. Clinically important abnormalities persisting at the end of the study /early withdrawal may be followed b y the investigator until resolution or until a clinically stable endpoint is reached . 9.4.1. Evaluations of Safety and Tolerability The study will include the following evaluations of safet y and tolerability according to the time points provided in the Time and Events Schedule: Adverse Events Adverse events will be reported by the subject for the duration of the study .

Allergic Reactions The Sponsor will proactively monitor reported AEs and query the study site, if necessary , to capture anaph ylactic reactio n/serum sickness events in the CRFs. Injection -Site Reactions An injection site reaction is any unfavorable or unintended sign that occurs at the study agent injection site. All subjects will be carefully observed at the study site for at least 30 minutes after the SC injection of study agent for symptoms of an injection -site reaction. If an injection site reaction is observed, the subject should be treated at the investigator ’s discretion. Subjects self-administering study agent away from the study site (at Weeks 32, 40, and 48) will be trained in the recognition and documentation of injection site reactions. Clinical Laboratory Tests Blood samples for serum chemistry and hema tology will be collected. The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source doc uments. All abnormal laboratory values will be evaluated for clinical significance by the investigator. If clinically significant abnormal laboratory values (in the opinion of the investigator) are detected, the test(s) should be repeated as necessary and in discussion with the study responsible physician. Instructions for the collection, handling, and shipping of blood samples are provided in the Laboratory Manual.

It is only needed for determining childbearing potential of a female subject of any age with amenorrhea forless than 12 months. In the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, 2 FSH measurements are needed. FSH is not needed for female subjects with amenorrhea for at least 12 months or any female subject of childbearing potential. Refer to Inclusion Criterion 11for detail. Pregnancy Testing Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and a negative urine pregnancy test at baseline before randomization. Additionally , urine pregnancy testing is required for all women of childbearing potential at every study agent administration visit. Pregnancy tests must be completed and the result must be negative before the administration of any agent for that visit. All pregnancy test results must be recorded in study source documents. Electrocardiogram (ECG) Asupine 12-lead ECG will be performed locally at Week 0 prior to administration of study agent, as specified in the Time and Events Schedule. A full 12-lead ECG will be recorded and the ECG data,including a copy of tracing as well as interpretation ,shoul d be stored in the subject's source document. NCT03162796"

Any abnormalities or changes in severity noted during the review of bod y systems should be documented in the sourc e document. Height and Weight Height and weight will be measured as specified in the Time and Events Schedule. Vital Signs Blood pressure and heart rate measurements will be assessed at the time points specified in the Time and Events Schedule. If any clinicall y significant changes in vital signs are noted, they must be reported as AEs and followed to resolution, or until reaching a clinically stable endpoint . 9.4.2. Electronic Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (eC -SSRS ) No signal of suicidal ideation and behavior has been observed in the clinical trials of guselkumab to date.However, in light of the recent reports concerning suicidal ideation and behavior in patients with plaque psoriasis treated w ith an IL-17R antagonist (brodalumab), the eC- SSRS will be used as a screening tool to prospectively evaluate the potential of guselkumab to induce suicidal ideation and behavior. The eC-SSRS measures five possible levels of suicidal ideation and four possible suicidal behaviors, as well as non-suicidal self-injurious behavior . The assessment is a fully -structured, subject self-report eC-SSRS questionnaire, including standardized questions, follow -up prompts, error handling routines, and scoring conventions .33,39 Two versions of the eC-SSRS will be used in this study , the Lifetime version and the Since Last Contact version. The Lifetime version will be conducted during the screening visit and the Since Last Contact version will be conducted at all other visits through Week 60. Subjects will complete the eC-SSRS questionnaire using the Sponsor -provided electronic tablets (or through an Interacti ve Voice Response System , if available) . Study site personnel will train the subjects on how to use the electronic device and/or a telephone sy stem . The eC-SSRS will be provided in the local languages in accordance with local guidelines. The eC-SSRS will be performed during each evaluation visit according to the Time and Events schedule. During a visit, subjects will be directed to a private, quiet place with the electronic device and/or a telephone to complete the assessment. Subjects who do not have suicidal behavior or ideation will answer a limited number of questions and will usually complete the assessment in about 3 minutes. Subjects with significa nt suicidal ideation and behavior may require up to 10 minutes toanswer all relevant questions. The eC-SSRS should be performed after the joint assessment at the screening visit (after signing informed consent) . At Week 0/baseline and at all post-baseline visits, the eC-SSRS will be the first assessment/questionnaire that the subject complete sprior to study agent administration . NCT03162796"

At screening (“In the last 6 months”) and Week 0, subjects with an Ideation Level (1-5) or any suicidal behaviors or with a response of “YES” for non-suicidal self-injurious behavior must be determined to be not at risk by the investigator based on an evaluation by a m ental health professional in order to be randomized. Subjects with an Ideation Level (1-5)on the eC -SSRS or any suicidal behaviors or with a response of “YES” for non-suicidal self-injurious behavior at any post-baseline visit will also be referred to an appropriate mental health professional for evaluation. If a subject’s psychiatric disorder can be adequatel y treated with psychotherap y and/or pharmacotherap y then the subject, at the discretion of the investigator, should be continued with treatment. Ultimately , the determination of suicidality and risk is up to the investigator’s clinical judgment following evaluation by a mental health professional (eg, psychiatrist, psy chologist, or appropriately trained social worker or nurse). Positive reports are generated from the eC -SSRS vendor for ANY of the following findings : Ideation Level 4: Some intent to act, no plan Ideation Level 5: Specific plan and intent Behaviors: Actual Suicide Attempts Behaviors: Interrupted Attempts Behaviors: Aborted Attempts Behaviors: Preparatory actions Negative suicidality indication reports are generated from the eC-SSRS vendor when there are NO indications of the above. The subject should not be released from the site until the eC-SSRS Findings Report (both for negative and positive reports) is reviewe d by the investigator and the subject’s risk has been assessed and follow -up determined, as appropriate. For each Ideation Level and Behavior , thefollowing actions and associated alerts will be generated, if applicable: No ideation with No Behaviors : No further action is needed. Ideation Levels (1-5)or suicidal behavior : Subject risk assessed and referral to a mental health professional. Ideation level of a 1, 2, or 3 with No Behaviors: Negative findings report will be generated. Ideation Level of a 4 or 5 or any suicidal behavior : Positive findings report will be generated. When the system reports that the subject has a positive suicidal indication (including for an incomplete -positive assessment), the site will be immediately notified by fax/email and a telephone call from the eC -SSRS vendor. Non-suicidal Self-injurious behavior = YES .Subject risk assessed and referral to a mental health professional.

Anticipated Events Anticipated events will be recorded and reported in this study . An anticipated event is an AE (serious or non-serious) that commonly occurs as a consequence of the underl ying disease or condition under investigation (disease related) or background regimen. For the purposes of this study the following events will be considered anticipated events: Worsening of psoriasis Worsening of PsA These even ts will be captured on the CRF and in the database, and will be reported to the Sponsor as described in All Adverse Events (Section 12.3.1 ). Any event that meets SAE criteria will be reported to the Sponsor within the appropriate timeline as described in Serious Adverse Events. These anticipated events are exempt from expedited reporting as individual single cases to Health Authorities. However, ifbased on an aggregate review, it is determined that an anticipated event is possibly related to study agent, the Sponsor will report these events in an expedited manner. An Anticipated Event Review Committee (ARC) will be established to perform reviews of pre-specified anticipated events at an aggregate level. The ARC is a safet y committee within the Sponsor’s organization that is independent of the Sponsor’s study team. The ARC will meet to aid in the recommendation to the Sponsor’s study team as to wheth er there is a reasonable possibility that an anticipated event is related to the study agent.

Subjects who prematurely discontinue study treatment for any reason before completion of the final safet y visit at Week 60will not be considered to have completed the study . 10.2. Discontinuation of Study Treatment A subject will not be automatically withdrawn from the study if he or she has to discontinue treatment before the end of the treatment regimen. A subject's study treatment must be discontinued if: The investigator believes that for safety reasons or tolerability reasons (eg,AE) it is in the best interest of the subject to discontinue study treatment. The subject becomes pregnant or plans to become pregnant. The subject is diagnosed with a malignancy , with the exception of no more than 2localized basal cell skin cancers that are treated with no evidence of recurrence or residual disease. The subject is deemed ineligible according to the following TB screening criteria: A diagnosis of active TB is made. A subject has symptoms suggestive of active TB based on follow -up assessment questions and/or physical examination, or has had recent close contact with a person with active TB, and cannot or will not continue to undergo additional evaluation. A subject undergoing evaluation has a chest radiograph with evidence of current active TB and/or a positive QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test result (or a positive tuberculin skin test result in countries in which the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test is not approved/registered or the tuberculin skin test is mandated by local health authorities), unless active TB can be ruled out and appropriate treatment for latent TB can be initiated before the next administration of study agent and continued to completion.

This determination must be promptly reported to the Sponsor’s medical monitor and recorded in the subject's source documents and initialed by the investigator. A subject receiving treatment for latent TB discontinues this treatment prematurely or is noncompliant with the therap y. The subject initiates the following protocol -prohibited medications: apremilast, systemic immunosuppressive drugs (Section 8.1.3 ), biologic agents, cytotoxic drugs, JAK inhibitors, or investigational ag ents (Section 8.4), and s ystemic therapy for psoriasis (Section 8.7). The subject withdraws consent for administration of study agent . The subject is unable to adhere to the study visit schedule or comply with protocol requirements. The subject develops an allergic reaction such as bronchospasm with wheezing and/or dyspnea requiring ventilatory support, or symptomatic hypotension that occurs following a study agent administration. The subject has a reaction resulting in myalgia and/or arthralgia with fever and/or rash (suggestive of serum sickness and not representative of signs and symptoms of other recognized clinical syndromes) occurring 1 to 14 days after an injection of study agent . These may be accompanied by other events including pruritus, facial, hand, or lip edema, dysphagia, urticaria, sore throat, and/or headache. Disco ntinuation of study treatment should be considered for subjects who report suicidal Ideation Level 4 (Some intent to act, no plan), Ideation Level 5 (Specific plan and intent ),or any suicidal behavior (Actual suicide attempts, Interrupted attempts, Aborted Attempts, or Preparatory actions) on a post-baseline (after Week 0) eC-SSRS assessment . Discussion of such subjects with the medical monitor or designee is required. Discontinuation of study agent should be considered and discussed with the study responsible physician or designee for subjects who develop a serious or opportunistic infection. Subjects who decide to discontinue study agent administration must be interviewed by the investigator to determine if a specific reason for discontinuing study agent can be identified. Subjects should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible AEs or lack of efficacy to their decision to discontinue study agent ; investigators should confirm that any AE information elicited or lack of efficacy has been documented. If a subject elects to discontinue study agent due to an AE or lack of efficacy , the event or lack of efficacy should be recorded as the reason for study agent discontinuation, even if the investigator's assessment is that the AE or the patient’s PsA condition would not require study agent discontinuation. The reason for study agent discontinua tion must be documented in the CRF and in source documents. Study agent assigned to a subject who discontinues may not be assigned to another subject.

If a subject permanently discontinues study agent at or after Week 24and prior to the Week 52 visit, the final efficacy visit should occur at the time of discontinuation or as soon as possible and all assessments under the final efficacy visit/Week 52should be performed .The subject should also return for a final safety visit approximately 12 weeks after the last study agent administration. 10.3. Withdrawal From the Study A subject w ill be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: Lost tofollow -up Withdrawal of consent Death To ensure access for subject follow -up, study sites should try to obtain both primary and secondary telephone contact numbers from subjects (eg, home, work, and mobile phones), as well as other contact information such as email addresses, and emphasize the importance of follow -up information to the subject, before randomization. If a subject fails to return for study visits, study site personnel m ust make all reasonable efforts to contact the subject to determine the subject’s reason for discontinuation/withdrawal before considering the subject to be lost to follow -up. Due diligence should include repeated telephone calls, certified letters, and email requests. Measures taken to obtain follow -up information must be documented. Withdrawal of consent should be a very unusual occurrence in a clinical trial; the investigator should make every effort to maintain good subject relationships to avoid withdrawals of consent. For subjects who truly request withdrawal of consent, it is recommended that the subject withdraw consent in writing and provide a reason, if possible; if the subject or the subject’s representative refuses to do so or is physicall y unavailable, the study site should document the reason for the subject’s failure to withdraw consent in writing, sign the documentation, and maintain it with the subject’s source records. When a subject withdraws before completing the study , the reason for withdrawal is to be documented in the CRF and in the source document. Study agent assigned to the withdrawn subject may not be assigned to another subject. Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. 10.4.

The Sponsor study site contact will, in turn, contact the biomarker representative to execute sample destruction. If requested, the investigator will receive written confirmation from the Sponsor that the sample(s) have been destro yed. Withdrawal From the Optional Research Samples While Remaining in the Main Study The subject may withdraw consent for optional research samples while remaining in the stud y. In such a case, the optional research sample(s) will be destro yed. The sample destruction process will proceed as described above. Withdrawal From the Use of Samples in Future Research The subject may withdraw consent for use of samples for future resea rch (refer to Section 16.2.5 ). In such a case, samples will be destroy ed after they are no longer needed for the clinical study . Details of the sample retention for future research are presented in the main ICF and in the separate ICF for optional research samples. 11. STATISTICA L METHODS Statistical analy sis will be done by the Sponsor or under the authority of the Sponsor. A general description of the statistical methods to be used to anal yze the efficacy and safet y data is outlined below. Specific details will be provided in the Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) . In general, efficacy and subject information analy ses will be based onthe Full Analy sis Set (FAS), includ ingall randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose (complete or partial) of study treatment , which will be analy zed based on the randomized treatment groups, regardless of the treatment subjects actually received. Safety analyses will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose (complete or partial) of study treatment and subjects will be analy zed based on the treatment groups they actuall y received, regardless of the treatment groups to which they were assigned. Pharmacokinetics analyses for guselkumab will include subjects who receive at least one complete dose of guselkumab and have at least one post-dose sample collection. Antibodies to guselkumab will be analy zed for subjects who receive at least one dose of guselkumab and have at least one post -dose sample collection. Simple descriptive summary statistics, such as n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, inter quantile range, minimum, and maximum for continuous variables, and counts and percentages for discrete variables will be used to summarize most data .

In general, for continuous efficacy endpoints, treatment comparisons will be performed using either a Mixed -Effect Model Repeated Measure model or an analy sis of covariance model. All of the models will have treatment group, the baseline non-biologic DMARD (MTX, SSZ, HCQ, LEF) use (yes/no), prior exposure to anti -TNF agents (yes/no), and baseline value as explanatory factors. In general, a ll statistical tests will be performed at a 2- sided significance level of α=0.05 . In addition, graphical data display s (eg, line plots) and subject listings may also be used to summarize/present the data . 11.1. Subject Information Descriptive statistics by the randomized treatment group will be provided for demographics, baseline disease characteristics, and prior and concomitant medications. 11.2. Sample Size Determination The sample size was chosen based on the data from a Sponsor’s recent PsA study , CNTO1275PSA3002 that included the subjects previously treated with biologic anti-TNF α agents. The ACR 20 response rates at Week 24 from CNTO1 275PSA300 2 were 20.2%, 43.7% and 43.8%, respectivel y, for the placebo, ustekinumab 45 mg, and ustekinumab 90 mg treatment groups . In order to ensure a statistical power of >90% at the significance level of 0.05 (2-sided), assuming that each of guselkumab 100 mg groups achieves an ACR 20 response of 40% compared with the placebo group response of 20% at Week 24, a total of 360 subjects are planned to be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to each of treatment groups.

Primary Endpoint Analyses The primary endpoint to be analy zed in this study is the proportion of subjects who achiev e an ACR 20 response at Week 24. Note that the intercurrent event of Treatment Failure prior to Week 24 (defined below) will be treated as non-response for the primary analysis, regardless of the observed ACR 20 response status. Treatment Failure Criteria 1.Discontinued study agent injections due to lack of efficac y. 2.Terminate stud y participation for an y reason. 3.Initiated or increased the dose of non-biologic DMARDs (MTX, SSZ, HCQ, LEF) or oral corticosteroids over baseline for PsA. 4.Initiated protocol prohibited medications/therapies for PsA. Subjects with missing data at Week 24 will be considered nonresponders. The treatment effect of each guselkumab group versus placebo will be tested using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by prior exposure to anti-TNF agents (yes/no) and baseline DMARD (MTX, SSZ, HCQ, LEF) use (yes/no) . The magnitude of the effect will be estimated by the difference in ACR 20 response rates between the guselkumab and placebo groups with the 95% confidence interval calculated based on Wald statistics. In order to control theoverall Type 1 error rate, the primary analysis will be tested in a fixed sequence . 1.Guselkumab 100 mg q4w versus placebo in ACR 20 response at Week 24. 2.Guselkumab 100 mg at Week 0, 4 then q8w versus placebo in ACR 20 response at Week 24. With the above specified order , each ofthe hypotheses will be tested at a 2-sided α-level of 0.05 provided that significance is achieved for the preceding hypothesis in the specified order. If a given comparison is not significant at the 2-sided α-level of 0.05, the rema ining treatment group comparisons will be considered as supportive analy sis. To evaluate the robustness of the primary endpoint analy sis, the exhaustive scenario tipping point sensitivity analyses will be performed by varying the amount of non-responder imputation for missing data. Additional sensitivity /supplemental analyses which vary how intercurrent events (e.g. treatment failures) are handled, how observed data are used, and how missing data are treated will be specified in the SAP to further address the robustness of treatment effect of ACR20 at Week 24 for the primary and alternative estimands (which will also be defined in the SAP).

ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING Timely, accurate, and complete reporting and analy sis of safety information from clinical studies are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, and the Sponsor, and are mandated by regulatory agencies worldwide. The Sponsor has established Standard Operating Procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safet y information; all clinical studies conducted by the Sponsor or its affiliates will be conducted in accordance with those procedures. Method of Detecting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs or SAEs. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. Solicited Adverse Events Solicited AEs are predefined local and systemic events for which the subject is specificall y questioned (see Section 9.1.1 ). Unsolic ited Adverse Events Unsolicited AEs are all AEs for which the subject is specifically not questioned. 12.1. Definitions 12.1.1. Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporal ly associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. (Definition per International Conference on Harmonisation [I CH]) This inc ludes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severit y or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities. Note: The Sponsor collects AEs starting with the signing ofthe ICF (refer to Section 12.3.1 for time of last AE recording). NCT03162796"
98,page_98,"CNTO 1959 (guselkumab) Clinical Protocol CNTO1959PSA3001 Amendment 1 99 Approved, Date: 25 January 2018Serious Adverse Event An SAE based on ICH and EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for Human Use is an y untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose: Results in death Is life -threatening (The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.) Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect Is a suspected transmission of an y infectious agen t via a medicinal product Is Medicall y Important* *Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life threat ening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should usually be considered serious. If a serious and unexpected AE occurs for which there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the study agent and the event (eg, death from anaph ylaxis), the event must be reported as a serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction even if it is a component of the study endpoi nt (eg, all- cause mortalit y). Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information An AE is considered unlisted if the nature or severit y is not consistent with the applicable product reference safet y information. For guselkumab, the expected ness of an AE will be determined b y whether or not it is listed in the I nvestigator's Brochure. Adverse Event Associated With the Use of the Drug An AE is considered associated with the use of the drug if the attribution is possible, probable, or very likely (Section 12.1.2 ). 12.1.2. Attribution Definitions Not Related An AE that is not related to the use of the drug. Doubtful An AE for which an alternative e xplanation is more likely , eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), or the relationship in time suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely . NCT03162796"
99,page_99,"CNTO 1959 (guselkumab) Clinical Protocol CNTO1959PSA3001 Amendment 1 100 Approved, Date: 25 January 2018Possible An AE that might be due to the use of the drug. An alternative explanation, eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is reasonable; therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded. Probable An AE that might be due to the use of the drug. The relationship in time is suggestive (eg,confirmed bydechallenge). An alternative explanation is less likely, eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). Very Likely An AEthat is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be reasonably explained by an alternative explanation, eg, concomitant dru g(s), concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very suggestive (eg, it is confirmed by dechallenge and rechallenge). 12.1.3. Severity Criteria An assessment of severity grade will be made using the following general categorical descriptors: Mild : Awaren ess of symptoms that are easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate :Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference with normal activity . Severe : Extreme distress, causing significant impairm ent of functioning or incapacitation. Prevents normal every day activities. The investigator should use clinical judgment in assessing the severit y of events not directly experienced b y the subject (eg, laboratory abnormalities). 12.2. Special Reporting Situations Safety events of interest on a Sponsor study agent that may require expedited reporting or safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to: Overdose of a Sponsor study agent Suspected abuse/misuse of a Sponsor study agent Accidental or occupational exposure to a Sponsor study agent Medication error involving a Sponsor product (with or without subject/patient exposure to the Sponsor study agent, eg, name confusion) Exposure to a Sponsor study agent from breastfeeding NCT03162796"

Any special reporting situation that meets the criteria of an SAE should be recorded on the SAE page of the CRF. 12.3. Procedures 12.3.1. All Adverse Events All AEs and special reporting situations, whether serious or non-serious, will be reported from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until completion of the subject's last study -related procedure, which may include contact for follow -up of safety . Serious AEs, including those spontaneously reported to the investigator within 12 week s after the last dose of study agent, must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form. The Sponsor will evaluate any safet y information that is spontaneously reported by an investigator beyond the time frame specified in the protocol . All events thatmeet the definition of an SAE will be reported as SAEs, regardless of whether they are protocol -specific assessments. Anticipated events will be recorded and reported as described in Attachment 5. All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severity , or presumed relationship to study agent, must be recorded using medical terminology in the source document and the CRF. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (eg,cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and head congestion should be reported as “upper respiratory infection”). Investigators must record in the CRF their opinion concerning the relationship of the AE to study therap y. All measures required for AE management must be recorded in the source document and reported according to Sponsor instructions. The Sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to the regulatory authorities. The Sponsor will also report to the investigator (and the head of the investigational institute where required) all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs). The investigator (or Sponsor where required) must report SUSARs to the appropriate IEC/IRB that approved the protocol unless otherwise required and documented by the IEC/I RB. A SUSAR will be reported to regulatory authorities unblinded. Participating investigators and IEC/IRB will receive a blinded SUSAR summary , unless otherwise specified. For all studies with an outpatient phase, including open -label studies, the subject must be provided with a ""wallet (study ) card"" and instructed to carry this card with them for the duration of the study indicating the following: Study number Statemen t, in the local language(s), that the subject is participating in a clinical study Investigator's name and 24-hour contact telephone number Local Sponsor's name and 24 -hour contact telephone number (for medical staff only ) Site number NCT03162796"

Serious A dverse Events All SAEs occurring during the study must be reported to the appropriate Sponsor contact person by study -site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of th e event. Information regarding SAEs will be transmitted to the Sponsor using the Serious Adverse Event Form, which must be completed and signed by a phy sician from the study site, and transmitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours . The initial and follow -up reports of an SAE should be made by facsimile (fax). All SAEs that have not resolved by the end of the study , or that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject's participation in the study , must be followed until any of the following occurs: The event resolves The event stabilizes The event returns to baseline, if a baseline value/status is available The event can be attributed to agents other than the study agent or to factors unrelated to study conduct It becomes unlikely that any additional information can be obtained (subject or health care practitioner refusal to provide additional information, lost to follow -up after demonstration of due diligence with follow-up efforts) Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product wil l be reported as an SAE. Any event requiring hospitalization (or prolongation of hospitalization) that occurs during the course of a subject's participation in a study must be reported as an SAE, except hospitalizations for the following: Hospitalizations not intended to treat an acute illness or AE (eg, social reasons such as pending placement in long -term care facility ). Surgery or procedure planned before entry into the study (must be documented in the CRF). Note: Hospitalizations that were planned befor e the signing of the ICF, and where the underly ing condition for which the hospitalization was planned has not worsened, will not be considered SAEs. Any AE that results in a prolongation of the originall y planned hospitalization is to be reported as a new SAE. For convenience ,the investigator may choose to hospitalize the subject for the duration of the treatment period. The cause of death of a subject in a study within 12 weeks after the last dose of study agent, whether or not the event is expected or a ssociated with the study agent, is considered an SAE.

Pregnancy All initial reports of pregnancy in female subjects or partners of male subjects must be reported to the Sponsor by the study -site personnel within 24 hours of their knowledge of the event using the appropriate pregnancy notification form. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form. Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must be promptly withdrawn from the study and discontinue further study treatment. Because the effect of the study agent on sperm is unknown, pregnancies in partners of male subjects included in the study will be reported as noted above. Follow -up information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and any postnatal sequelae in the infant will be required. 12.3.4. Events of Special Interest Any newly identified malignancy or case of active TB occurring after the first administration of study agent in subjects participating in this clinical study must be reported by the investigator according to the procedures in Section 12.2.

Each single -use PFS-U contains 100 mg (1 mL fill of liquid) in a 1 mL glass syringe with a 27 gauge, 1/2 inch fixed needle and a latex -free rigid needle shield. No preservatives are present. The guselkumab solution should be essentially free of visible particulate matter. The PFS-U is a passive safety needle guard that is permanently assembled on the syringe and incorporates a spring driven shield that automaticall y extends beyond the PFS needle following complete injection of the guselkuma b PFS contents. Guselkumab will be manufactured and provided under the responsibility of the Sponsor. Refer to the Investigator's Brochure for a list of excipients. Placebo for guselkumab is supplied as a sterile liquid for SC injection at a nominal volum e of 1.0mL in a single -use PFS assembled with the PFS- U. Concomitant medications, including those inTable 3, will not be supplied by the Sponsor but rather must be acquired from a commercial pharmacy . 14.2. Packaging The investigational supplies will be uniquel y packaged to assure that they are appropriatel y managed throughout the supply chain process. 14.3. Labeling Study agent labels will contain information t o meet the applicable regulatory requirements. 14.4.

Drug A ccountability The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all study agent received at the site is inventoried and accounted for throughout the study . The study agent administered to the subject must be documented on the drug accountability form. All study agent will be stored and disposed of according to the Sponsor's instructions. Study -site personnel must not combine contents of the study agent containers. Study agents must be handled in strict accordance with the protocol and the container label, and must be stored at the study site in a limited -access area or in a locked cabinet under appropriate environmental conditions. Unused study agent (including guselkumab and placebo,) must be available for verification by the Sponsor's study site monitor during on-site monitoring visits. The return to the Sponsor of unused study agents (including guselkumab and placebo) will be documented on thedrug return form. When the study site is an authorized destruction unit and study agent supplies are destroy ed on -site, this must also be documented on the drug return form. Potentially hazardous materials such as used ampules, needles, syringes and vials containing hazardous liquids should be disposed of immediately in a safe manner and therefore will not be retained for drug accountability purposes. The immediate destruction of these drug supplies should be documented in the drug accountability records on site. Study agents should be dispensed under the supervision of the investigator or a qualified member of the study -site personnel, or by a hospital/clinic pharmacist. Study agents will be supplied only to subjects participating in the study . Study agents may not be relabeled or reassigned for use by other subjects. The investigator agrees neither to dispense the study agent from, nor store it at, any site other than the study sites agreed upon with the Sponsor. Subjects who will be self -administering study agent at home will receive detailed instructions for study agent storage and disposal of used syringes and handling of unused study material. These subjects will receive a sharps container to dispose of used syringes and will be instructed to return the sharps container and/or unused cartons with syringes. Subjects who self-administer at home will record stud y agent administrations with time and date information in a Diary . 15.

ETHICA L ASPECTS 16.1. Study -Specific Design Considerations Potential subjects will be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the study and, d uring the study , subjects will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue participation. They will be told that their consent to participate in the study is voluntary and may be withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalt y or loss of benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled. Only subjects who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits, and potential AEs of the study , and provide their consent voluntarily will be enrolled. The primary ethical concern is that subjects with active disease may receive placebo for 24weeks. However, the placebo control is necessary to capture the change in clinical endpoints that may occur in the absence of active treatment and is recommended by regulatory authorities. The disease activity of each subject will be closely monitored during the study and early escape has been incorporated in the study design to allow subjects to receive additional concomitant medications for PsA at the investigator’s discretion if the early escape criterion is met. The duration of the placebo exposure is limited to 24 weeks and is considered acceptable by ICH (http://www.ich.org/fileadmin/Public_Web_Site/ICH_Products/Guidelines/Efficacy /E10/Step4/E 10_Guideline.pdf). The total blood volume to be collected is considered to be an acceptable amount of blood to be collected over this time period from the population in this study based upon the standard of the American Red Cross for blood donation. A chest X-ray may be performed at screening if the subject does not have a chest X-ray within 12 weeks prior to the first administration of study agent. The exposure from 1 standard chest X- ray is 0.1 mSV, comparable to 10 day s of exposure to natural background radi ation. 16.2. Regulatory Ethics Compliance 16.2.1. Investigator Responsibilities The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the study is performed in accordance with the protocol, current ICH guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable regulatory and country -specific requirements. Good Clinical Practice is an international ethical and scientific qualit y standard for designing, conducting, recording, and reporting studies that involve the participation of human subjects. Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety , and well -being of NCT03162796"

At least once a year, the IEC/I RB will be asked to review and reapprove this study , where required. At theend of the study , the investigator (or Sponsor where required) will notify the IEC/I RB about the study completion (if applicable, the notification will be submitted through the head of investigational institution). 16.2.3. Informed Consent Each subject must give written consent according to local requirements after the nature of the study has been fully explained. The ICF(s) must be signed before performance of any study - related activity . The ICF(s) that is/are used must be approved by both the Sponsor and by the reviewing IEC/I RB and be in a language that the subject can read and understand. The informed consent should be in accordance with principles that originated in the Declaration of Helsinki, current ICH and GCP guidelines, applicable regulatory requirement s, and Sponsor policy . Before enrollment in the study , the investigator or an authorized member of the study -site personnel must explain to potential subjects the aims, methods, reasonably anticipated benefits, and potential hazards of the study , and any discomfort participation in the study may entail. Subjects will be informed that their participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw consent to participate at any time. They will be informed that choosing not to participate will not affect the care the subject will receive for the treatment of his or her disease. Subjects will be told that alternative treatments are available if they refuse to take part and that such refusal will not prejudice future treatment. Finally , they will be told that the investigator will maintain a subject identification register for the purposes of long-term follow -up if needed and that their records may be accessed by health authorities and authorized Sponsor personnel without NCT03162796"

By signing the I CF the subject is authorizing such access. The subject will be given sufficient time to read the ICF and the opportunity to ask questions. After this explanation and before entry into the study , consent should be appropriatel y recorded by means of the subject's personally dated signature. After having obtained the consent, a copy of the I CF must be given to the subject. Subjects will be asked for consent to provide optional samples for research (where local regulations permit). After informed consent for the study is appropriatel y obtained, the subject will be asked to sign and personally date a separate ICF indicating agreement to participate in the optional research componen t. Refusal to participate in the optional research will not result in ineligibility for the stud y. A cop y of this signed ICF will be given to the subject. The subject must be able to read and write and should personally sign the ICF. A limited number of s tudy sites may be asked by the Sponsor to obtain informed consent using a validated electronic system instead of a paper -based process. If both parties (Sponsor and the study site) agree, and if participation is allowed by local regulations and IEC/IRB requirements, the means to facilitate such a process will be provided to the sites by Sponsor. The actual mechanism of consenting will be facilitated by the use of an eTablet device (eg, iPad®), but overall the consent process will remain the same, as describ ed in this section . At these study sites, subjects will still be required to review the entire informed consent as a written document on the eTablet and then to apply their handwritten signature electronicall y by the use of a stylus directly onto the eTabl et.Alternatel y, the site will also have the option to print the electronic version of the ICF and apply a handwritten signature. 16.2.4. Privacy of Personal Data The collection and processing of personal data from subjects enrolled in this study will be limited to those data that are necessary to fulfill the objectives of the stud y. These data must be collected and processed with adequate precautions to ensure confidentialit y and compliance with applicable data privacy protection laws and regulations. Appropriat e technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data against unauthorized disclosures or access, accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss or alteration must be put in place. Sponsor personnel whose responsibilities require access to personal data agree to keep the identit y of subjects confidential. The informed consent obtained from the subject includes explicit consent for the processing of personal data and for the investigator/institution to allow direct access to his or heroriginal medical records (source data/documents) for study -related monitoring, audit, IEC/IRB review, and regulatory inspection. This consent also addresses the transfer of the data to other entities and to other countries. NCT03162796"

Reasonable steps will be taken to respond to such a request, taking into consideration the nature of the request, the conditions of the study , and the applicable laws and regulations. Exploratory DNA, PD, PK, and immunogenicity research is not conducted under standards appropriate for the return of data to subjects. In addition, the Sponsor cannot make decisi ons as to the significance of any findings resulting from exploratory research. Therefore, exploratory research data will not be returned to subjects or investigators, unless required by law or local regulations. Privacy and confidentiality of data generat ed in the future on stored samples will be protected b y the same standards applicable to all other clinical data. 16.2.5. Long -Term Retention of Samples for A dditional Future Research Samples collected in this study may be stored for up to 15 years, starting from last patient, last visit (or according to local regulations) for additional research. Samples will only be used to understand guselkumab, to understand PsA, to understand differential drug responders, and to develop tests/assays related to guselkumab andPsA. The research may begin at any time during the study or the post -study storage period. Stored samples will be coded throughout the sample storage and analysis process and will not be labeled with personal identifiers. Subjects may withdraw their consent for their samples to be stored for research (refer to Section 10.3). 16.2.6. Country Selection This study will only be conducted in those countries where the intent is to launch or otherwise help ensure access to the developed product if the need for the product persists, unless explicitly addressed as a specific ethical consideration in Section 16.1. 17. ADMINISTRA TIVE REQUI REMENTS 17.1. Protocol A mendments Neither the investigator nor the Sponsor will modify this protocol without a formal amendment by the Sponsor. All protocol amendments must be issued by the Sponsor, and signed and dated by the investigator. Protocol amendments must not be implemented without prior IEC/I RB approval, or when the relevant competent authority has raised any grounds for non-acceptance, except when necessary to eliminate immedi ate hazards to the subjects, in which case the amendment must be promptly submitted to the IEC/I RB and relevant competent authority . Documentation of amendment approval by the investigator and IEC/IRB must be provided to the Sponsor. When the change(s) involves only logistic or administrative aspects of the study , the IEC/IRB (where required) only needs to be notified. During the course of the study , in situations where a departure from the protocol is unavoidable, the investigator or other physician in attendance will contact the appropriate Sponsor representative listed in the Contact Information page(s), which will be provided as a separate NCT03162796"

Subject Identification, Enrollment, and Screening Logs The investigator agrees to complete a subject identification and enrollment log to permit easy identification of each subject during and after the study . This document will be reviewed by the Sponsor study -site contact for completeness. The subjec t identification and enrollment log will be treated as confidential and will be filed by the investigator in the study file. To ensure subject confidentialit y, no copy will be made. All reports and communications relating to the study will identify subject s by subject identification and date of birth if permitted by the local authorities. In cases where the subject is not randomized into the study , the date seen and date of birth (as appropriate) will be used. The investigator must also complete a subject screening log, which reports on all subjects who were seen to determine eligibility for inclusion in the study . 17.4. Source Documentation At a minimum, source documents consistent in the type and level of detail with that commonly recorded at the study site as a basis for standard medical care must be available for the following: subject identification, eligibility , and study identification; study discussion and date of signed informed consent; dates of visits; results of safety and efficacy parameters as require d by the protocol; record of all AEs and follow -up of AEs; prior and concomitant medication; drug receipt/dispensing/return records; study agent administration information; and date of study completion and reason for early discontinuation of study agent orwithdrawal from the study , if applicable. The author of an entry in the source documents should be identifiable. Specific details required as source data for the study and source data collection methods will be reviewed with the investigator before the study and will be described in the monitoring guidelines (or other equivalent document). The following subject- and investigator -completed PsA scales and assessments designated by the Sponsor will be recorded directl y into an electronic device and will be considered source data: Joint Assessment, Subject’s Assessment of Pain, Subject’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity , Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity , Dacty litis and Enthesitis Assessments, HAQ -DI, SF-36, FACIT -Fatigue, PROMI S 29, BASD AI, IGA, PASI, BSA, eC-SSRS.

An electronic source system may be utilized, which contains data traditionally maintained in a hospital or clinic record to document medical care (eg, electro nic source documents) as well as the clinical study -specific data fields as determined by the protocol. This data is electronicall y extracted for use by the Sponsor. If the electronic source system is utilized, references made to the CRF in the protocol include the electronic source system but information collected through the electronic source system may not be limited to that found in the CRF. Data in this system may be considered source documentation. During at-home administration (Weeks 32, 40, and 48),subjects will enter information on their study agent administration on a patient diary . 17.5. Case Report Form Completion Case report forms are prepared and provided by the Sponsor for each subject in electronic format. All CRF entries, corrections, and alterations must be made by the investigator or authorized study -site personnel. The investigator must verify that all data entries in the CRF are accurate and correct. The study data will be transcribed by study-site personnel from the source documents onto an electronic CRF, if applicable. Study-specific data will be transmitted in a secure manner to the Sponsor. Worksheets may be used for the capture of some data to facilitate completion of the CRF. Any such worksheets will become part of the subject's sourc e documents. Data must be entered into CRF in English. The CRF must be completed as soon as possible after a subject visit and the forms should be available for review at the next scheduled monitoring visit. All subjective measurements (eg, pain scale information or other questionnaires) will be completed by the same individual who made the initial baseline determinations whenever possible. If necessary , queries will be generated in the eDC tool. If corrections to a CRF are needed after the initial entry into the CRF, this can be done in either of the following way s: Investigator and study -site personnel can make corrections in the eDC tool at their own initiative or as a response to an auto query (generated by the eDC tool).

Data Quality Assurance/Quality Control Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified investigators and appropriate study sites, review of protocol procedures with the investigator and study -site personnel before the study , periodic monitoring visits by the Sponsor, direct transmission of clinical laboratory data from a central laboratory to the Sponsor’s clinical database, andelectronic transmission of ePRO data to the ePRO vendor database then to the Sponsor’s clinical database. Written instructions will be provided for collection, handling, storage, and shipment of samples. Guidelines for CRF completion will be provided and reviewed with study -site personnel before the start of the stud y The Sponsor will review CRF for accuracy and completeness during on-site monitoring visits and after transmission to the Sponsor; any discrepancies will be resolved with the investigator o r designee, as appropriate. After upload of the data into the study database they will be verified for accuracy and consistency with the data sources. 17.7. Record Retention In compliance with the ICH/GCP guidelines, the investigator/institution will maintain all CRF and all source documents that support the data collected from each subject, as well as all study documents as specified in ICH/GCP Section 8, Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial, and all study documents as specified by the applic able regulatory requirement(s). The investigator/institution will take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these documents. Essential documents must be retained until at least 2years after the last approval of a marketing applicatio n in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents will be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the Sponsor. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retaine d. If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the responsibility . The Sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new custodian. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study documents before having obtained written approval from the Sponsor. NCT03162796"

Monitoring The Sponsor will use a combination of monitoring techniques (central, remote, on-site monitoring) to monitor this study . The Sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequently as necessary . The monitor will record dates of the visits in a study site visit log that will be kept at the study site. The first post- initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, the monitor will compare data entered into the CRF with the source documents (eg, hospital/clinic/phy sician’s office medical records); a sample may be reviewed. The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that all sources of original data required to complete the CRF are known to the Sponsor and study -site personnel and are accessible for verification by the Sponsor study-site contact. If electronic records are maintained at the study site, the method of verification must be discussed with the study -site personnel. Direct access to source documents (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of verify ing that therecorded data are consistent with the original source data. Findings from this review will be discussed with the study -site personnel. The Sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the relevant study -site personnel will be available, the source docu ments will be accessible, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study conduct. In addition to on-site monitoring visits, remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during these remote contacts, study -site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress of the study at the site. Central monitoring will take place for data identified by the Sponsor as requiring central review. 17.9. Study Completion/Termination 17.9.1. Study Completion/End of Study The study is considered completed with the last visit for the last subject participating in the study . The final data from the study site will be sent to the Sponsor (or designee) after completion of the final subject visit at that study site, in the time frame specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement. 17.9.2. Study Termination The Sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or termina te the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the Sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study -site closure v isit has been performed. The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. NCT03162796"

On-Site A udits Representatives of the Sponsor's clinical quality assurance department may visit the study site at any time during or after completion of the study to conduct an audit of the study in compliance with regulatory guidelines and company policy . These audits will require access to all study records, including source documents, for inspection. Subject privacy must, however, be respected. The investigator and study -site personnel are responsible for being present and available for consultation during routinely scheduled study -site audit visits conducted by the Sponsor or its designees. Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by agents of any regulatory body, either as part of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study in support of a regulatory submission. The investigator should immediately notify the Sponsor if he or she has been contacted b y a regulatory agency concerning an upcoming inspection. 17.11. Use of Information and Publication All information, including but not limited to information regarding guselkumab or the Sponsor's operations (eg,patent application, formulas, manufacturing processes, basic scientific data, prior clinical data, formula tion information) supplied by the Sponsor to the investigator and not previously published, and any data, including pharmacogenomic or exploratory biomarker research data, generated as a result of this study , are considered confidential and remain the sole propert y of the Sponsor. The investigator agrees to maintain this information in confidence and use this information only to accomplish this study, and will not use it for other purposes without the Sponsor's prior written consent. The investigator unders tands that the information developed in the study will be used by the Sponsor in connection with the continued development of guselkumab, and thus may be disclosed as required to other clinical investigators or regulatory agencies. To permit the information derived from the clinical studies to be used, the investigator is obligated to provide the Sponsor with all data obtained in the study . The results of the study will be reported in a Clinical Study Report generated by the Sponsor and will conta in data from all study sites that participated in the study as per protocol. Recruitment performance or specific expertise related to the nature and the key assessment parameters of the study will be used to determine a coordinating investigator. Results of pharmacogenomic or biomarker analyses performed after the Clinical Study Report has been issued will be reported in a separate report and will not require a revision of the Clinical Study Report.

Any work created in connection with performance of the study and contained in the data that can benefit from copyright protection (except any publication by the investigator as provided for below) shall be the propert y of the Sponsor as author and owner of copy right in such work. Consistent with Good Publication Practices and International Committee of Medical Journal Editors guidelines, the Sponsor shall have the right to publish such primary (multicenter) data and information without approval from the investigator. The investigator has the right to publish study site-specific data after the primary data are published. If an investigator wishes to publish information from the study , a copy of the manuscript must be provided to the Sponsor for re view at least 60days before submission for publication or presentation. Expedited reviews will be arranged for abstracts, poster presentations, or other materials. If requested by the Sponsor in writing, the investigator will withhold such publication forup to an additional 60days to allow for filing of a patent application. In the event that issues arise regarding scientific integrity or regulatory compliance, the Sponsor will review these issues with the investigator. The Sponsor will not mandate modif ications to scientific content and does not have the right to suppress information. For multicenter study designs and substudy approaches, secondary results generall y should not be published before the primary endpoints of a study have been published. Simi larly, investigators will recognize the integrity of a multicenter study by not submitting for publication data derived from the individual study site until the combined results from the completed study have been submitted for publication, within 12 months of the availability of the final data (tables, listings, graphs), or the Sponsor confirms there will be no multicenter study publication. Authorship of publications resulting from this study will be based on the guidelines on authorship, such as those described in the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, which state that the named authors must have made a significant contribution to the design of the study or analy sis and interpretation of the data, provided critical revie w of the paper, and given final approval of the final version. Registration of Clinical Studies and Disclosure of Results The Sponsor will register and disclose the existence of and the results of clinical studies as required b y law. NCT03162796"

It utilizes the recently identified M.tuberculosis -specific antigens ESA T-6 and CFP-10 in the standard format, as well as TB7.7 (p4) in the In-Tube format, to detect in vitro cell-mediated immune responses in infected individuals. The QuantiFERON®-TB Gold assay measures the amount of IFN-produced by sensitized T- cells when stimulated with the synthetic M. tuberculosis -specific antigens. In M. tuberculosis -infected persons, sensitized Tlymphocytes will secrete IFN-in response to stimulation with the M. tuberculosis -specific antigens and, thus, the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test should be positive. Because the antigens used in the test are specific to M. tuberculosis and not found in BCG, the test is not confounded by BCG vaccination, unlike the tuberculin skin test. However, there is some cross -reactivit y with the 3 Mycobacterium species, M. kansasii , M. marinum , and M.szulgai . Thus, a positive test could be the result of infection with one of these 3species of Mycobacterium, in the absence of M. tuberculosis infection.  In a study of the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test (standard format) in subjects with active TB, sensitivity has been shown to be approximately 89% (Mori et al, 2004). Specificity of the test in healthy BCG -vaccinated individuals has been demonstrated to be m ore than 98%. In contrast, the sen sitivity and specificity of the tuberculin skin test was noted to be only about 66% and 35% in a study of Japanese patients with active TB and healthy BCG- vaccinated young adults, respectively. However, sensitivity and specificity of the tuberculin skin t est depend on the population being studied, and the tuberculin skin test performs best in healthy young adults who have not been BCG -vaccinated.  Data from a limited number of published studies examining the performance of the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold assay in immunosuppressed populations suggest that the sensitivity of the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test is better than the tuberculin skin test even in immunosuppressed patients (Ferrara et al, 2005; Kobashi et al, 2007; Matulis et al, 2008). The ability of IFN--based tests to detect latent infection has been more difficult to study due to the lack of a gold standard diagnostic test; however, several TB outbreak studies have demonstrated that the tests correlated better than the tuberculin skin test with the degree ofexposure that contacts had to the index TB case (Brock et al, 2004; Ewer et al, 2003). In addition, TB contact tracing studies have shown that patients who had a positive QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test result and were not treated for latent TB infection were much more likely to develop active TB during longitudinal follow -up than those who had a positive tuberculin skin test and a negative QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test result (Higuchi et al, 2007; Diel et al, 2008).  Although the performance of the new IFN--based blood tests for active or latent M.tuberculosis infection have not been well validated in the immunosuppressed population, experts believe these new tests will be at least as, if not more, sensitive, and definitely more specific, than the tuberculin skin test (Barnes, 2004; personal communication, April, 2008 TB Advisory Board). Performing the QuantiFERON®-TB Gold Test  The QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test In-Tube format will be provided for this study. The In-Tube format contains 1 additional M. tuberculosis -specific antigen, TB7.7 (p4), which is thought to increase the specificity of the test.  To perform the test using the In-Tube format, blood is drawn through standard venipuncture into supplied tubes that already contain the M. tuberculosis -specific antigens . Approximately 3 tubes will be needed per subject, each requiring 1mL of blood. One tube contains the M. tuberculosis -specific antigens, while the remaining tubes contain positive and negative control reagents. Thorough mixing of the blood w ith the an tigens is necessary prior to incubation. The blood is then incubated for 16 to 24 hours at 37C, after which tubes are centrifuged for approximately 15 minutes at 2000 to 3000 g. Following centrifugation, plasma is harvested from each tube, frozen, and shipped on dry ice to the central laboratory. The central laboratory will perform an ELISA to quantify the amount of IFN -present in the plasma using spectrophotometry and computer software analysis.  The central laboratory will analyze and report results for each subject, and sites will be informed of the results. Subjects who have an indeterminate result should have the test repeated.  In the rare instance that the site is not able to perform the QuantiFERON® -TB Gold test handling process prior to sendi ng to Covance, this test may be performed locally by another laboratory, as approved by the Sponsor.

Multiple puncture tests (Tine and Heaf) should not be used to determine whether a person is infected because the amount of tuberculin injected intradermally cannot be precisely controlled. Tuberculin skin testing is both safe and reliable throughout the course of pregnancy. The Mantoux tuberculin test is performed by placing an intradermal injection of 0.1 mL of tuberculin into the inner surfa ce of the forearm. The test must be performed with tuberculin that has at least the same strength as either 5tuberculin units (TU) of standard purified protein derivative (PPD) -S or 2TU of PPD-RT23, Statens Seruminstitut, as recommended by the World Health Organization. PPD strengths of 1TU or 250TU are not acceptable (Menzies, 2000). Using a disposable tuberculin syringe with the needle bevel facing upward, the injection should be made just beneath the surface of the skin. This should produce a discrete, pale elevation of the skin (a wheal) 6mm to 10mm in diameter. To prevent needle -stick injuries, needles should not be recapped, purposely bent or broken, removed from disposable syringes, or otherw ise manipulated by hand. After they are used, disposable needles and syringes should be placed in puncture -resistant containers for disposal. Institutional guidelines regarding universal precautions for infection control (eg, the use of gloves) should be follow ed. A trained health care worker, prefer ably the investigator, should read the reaction to the Mantoux test 48 to 72 hours after the injection. Subjects should never be allow ed to read their own tuberculin skin test results. If a subject fails to show up for the scheduled reading, a positive r eaction may still be measurable up to 1week after testing. However, if a subject who fails to return within 72 hours has a negative test, tuberculin testing should be repeated. The area of induration (palpable raised hardened area) around the site of injection is the reaction to tuberculin. For standardization, the diameter of the induration should be measured transversely (perpendicular) to the long axis of the forearm. Erythema (redness) should not be measured. All reactions should be recorded in mi llimeters, even those classified as negative. Interpreting the Tuberculin Skin Test Results  In the US and many other countries, the most conservative definition of positivity for the tuberculin skin test is reserved for immunocompromised patients, and thisdefinition is to be applied in this study to maximize the likelihood of detecting latent TB, even though the subjects may not be immunocompromised at baseline.  In the US and Canada, an induration of 5mm or greater in response to the intradermal tubercul in skin test is considered to be a positive result and evidence for either latent or active TB.  In countries outside the US and Canada, country -specific guidelines for immunocomprom ised patients should be consulted for the interpretation of tuberculin skin test results. If no local country guidelines for immunocompromised patients exist, US guidelines must be follow ed. Treatment of Latent Tuberculosis  Local country guidelines for immunocompromised patients should be consulted for acceptable antituberculo us treatment regimens for latent TB. If no local country guidelines for immunocompromised patients exist, US guidelines must be follow ed. References Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
