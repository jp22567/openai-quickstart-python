Sponsor Medtronic, Inc. Indication under investigation The indication under investigati on is overactive bladder (OAB). There are no investigational dev ices used in this study, all st udy products will be used in accordance with the product labeling. Investigation Purpose To assess the effect of three different amplitude settings (50% of sensory threshold, 80% of sensory threshold and s ensory thresho ld) on urinary urge inco ntinence (UUI). Sensory threshold is defined as the amplitude where the subject first perceives the sensation of the s timulation in the perineum, per ianal, vaginal, or any location deemed appropriate by the investigator while in a seated position. Product Status The InterStim II system is comme rcially approved for the treat ment of patients with OAB. Primary Objective To explore the effect of three different amplitude settings on urinary urge incontinence (UUI). Secondary Objective To characterize results from the ICIQ-OABqol questionnaire for the three different amplitude settings. Additional Measures to summarize safety for the three different a mplitude settings. Study Design This is a prospective, randomize d, multicenter, single-blinded study to explore the efficacy and quality of life (QoL) of 3 different a mplitude settings.

However, there is some evidence that SN M for fecal incontinence is effective at sub-sensory threshold/amplitude.3 This study will explore whether lower amplitude stimulation ca n provide improved symptom control when compared to baseline. P otential effects of lower amplitude may include changes in or sustai ned efficacy, or reduced patien t complaints due to uncomfortable stimulation. This feasibility study will provide an initial und erstanding of various amplitude stimulation settings and the impact on symptoms. The effect of amplitude on SNM therapy efficacy is not well cha racterized clinically for either OAB4 or fecal incontinence5. However, preclinical data suggest the effect of SNM is amplit ude-dependent. Using the rodent model of rhythmic bladder contractions (RBC), Su et al (2012) showed th at increasing amplitude of spinal nerve stimulation from motor threshold ampl itude to 3x motor threshold resulted in inhibition of bladder contractio ns by 20 to 90%, respectively.6 Similarly, using the RBC model in cats, Snellings and Grill ( 2012) showed that stimulation of the of th e pudendal nerves inhibited the frequency of contractions and increased bladder capacity at 0.8, 1, and 2 times motor threshold in an intensity- dependent manner.7 Finally, stimulation of tibial nerve and dorsal nerve of the penis produced an amplitude-dependent inhibition of bladder contractions in the r odent.8 The sum of these studies suggest that the effect of neurom odulation on bladder function is amplitude-dependent. Duelund-Jakobsen et al (2013) demonstrated that there was no si gnificant difference in reduction of fecal incontinent episodes when subjects were programmed to 50% , 75%, and 100% of sensory ÆÅÆÄÆÅÅ½Å¯ÄÍ¾Å¶ÑÏ­ÏµÍ¿Í3 In a recent clinical study u sing fMRI, Gill et al demonstrat ed a stimulation amplitude- dependent response in brain acti vity in 6 patients receiving su b-sensory, sensory, and supra-sensory SNM.6 These studies suggest SNM efficacy at sub-sensory amplitudes. Given the preclinical data showing an amplitude-dependent effec t of neuromodulation on bladder function and the clinical data de monstrating a therapeutic effe ct of sub-sensory amplitude, it is important to understand the effica cy of SNM at different subsen sory and sensory threshold amplitudes. 3XUSRVH The purpose of this prospective, multicenter, randomized, singl e-blind feasibility study is to explore the efficacy and quality of life unde r 3 different amplitude settin gs (sub-sensory amplitudes of 50% and 80% of sensory threshold and sensory threshold).

Change of average UUI per day at 12-week follow-up will be assessed under each amplitude setting . This study requires approximately 42 implanted and randomized subjects with 12-week follow-up data t o be analyzed for the primary objective. Assuming 10% attritio n after full system implant and 80% therapy evaluation success rate, approximately 48 subjects will be implanted and randomized in 3 arms. However, these numbers may be exceeded to ensure that a m inimum of 42 subjects complete th e study. The objectives are descriptive in nature. Confidence interval s will be calculated to describe the precision of the treatment effec t in each arm. Precision is def ined as one-half of the confidence interval (also known as the distance from the confidence limits to the m ean). Sample size calculations were completed using the PASS 11 Confidence Intervals for One Mean m odule. From the randomized portion of the InSite study13, a mean reduction of 2.1Â±1.8 UUI episodes per day was observed at 3 months in SNM subjects; and from the all impl anted cohort of InSite, a mean reduction of 2.3Â±2.7 UUI episodes per day was observed at 3 mon ths in SNM subjects. Based on this, we are assuming mean redu ctions between 1.8 a nd 2.3 will be observ ed in the study, along with standard deviations ranging from 2.2 to 2.7. Based on a confidence interval con structed with a t-statistic, a two-sided type-I error rate of 0.05, and using the largest standard devia tion assumed (2.7), a sample si ze of 14 subjects per arm will have a precision of 1.56 (Table 13-1). This precision is less than our lowest assumed treatm ent effect (1.8 UUI), so that it is expected that the lower 95% CI will be greater th an 0 for all treatment arms, even in the scenario when the largest assume d standard deviation is applied .

The resolved disc repancy will become a part of the eCRF record for the subject. The Oracle Clinical Remote Data Capture (RDC) system which is 2 1CFRÂ§11 Part E compliant controls user access, and ensures data integrit y. This system is a fully vali dated system.
