The safety endpoints of long -term treatment include AEs, clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry from the first dose of study drug in the open -label study, for subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the open -label study. The safety analysis wi ll be descriptive only, and in general will be performed for the pooled population. The secondary objective of the study is the evaluation of long -term efficacy of VX-659 in TC with TEZ/IVA, as assessed by spirometry, documentation of events related to hea lth outcomes (e.g., PEx), height (for ≤21 years of age on the date of informed consent in the parent study only), weight, and CFQ -R. Methods of efficacy analyses will be similar as those used in parent studies. Interim Analyses Interim analyses may ta ke place at any time during the study at the discretion of the sponsor. In the event that a parent study is still ongoing, a limited Vertex team may be unblinded to the treatment assignments in the parent studies for the purpose of reviewing the interim re sults and will not be involved in or influence the conduct of the remaining part of the parent study to protect the integrity of the parent study . IDMC Reviews The independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will conduct regular safety reviews of stud y data as outlined in the IDMC charter."

At present, there is no cure. CF affects approximately 70,000 individuals worldwide1 (approximately 30,000 in the US1,2 and 39,000 in the EU3). B ased on its prevalence, CF qualifies as an orphan disease .4, 5 CF is caused by decreased quantity and/or function of the CFTR protein due to mutations in the CFTR gene. The CFTR protein is an epithelial chloride channel that aids in regulating salt and wa ter absorption and secretion and pH balance in sweat glands and multiple organs, including the lungs, pancreas, and other gastrointestinal organs. Despite progress in the treatment of CF with antibiotics and mucolytics, the predicted median age of survival for a person with CF is approximately 40 years.2,6 Progressive loss of lung function is the leading cause of mortality .7 More effective treatments are needed for CF. The most common disease-causing CFTR mutation, F508de l, accounts for 70% of the identified alleles in people with CF8, and approximately 40% of people with CF are homozygous for F508del (F/F).8, 2, 3 Based on the understanding of the molecular defects caused by CFTR mutations, 2 complementary approaches have been developed to address the decreased quantity and/or func tion of CFTR in order to enhance chloride transport in patients with CF. Correctors facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking to increase the quantity of functional CFTR at the cell surface. Potentiators increase the channel open probability of the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface to enhance ion transport. Depending on the amount of residual CFTR channel activity in the membrane, and the pathophysiology of that activity (reflecting the CFTR genotype of the patient and possibly other factors), both approaches may be required. The therapeutic activity of CFTR correctors and potentiators has been established with products that were developed by Vertex and approved for the treatment of CF: ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy (Kalydeco®), and lumacaftor (LUM) in combination with IVA (Orkambi®). Kalydeco and Orkambi are approved to treat CF in patients with specific CFTR genotypes. A se cond corrector/potentiator combination, tezacaftor (TEZ)/IVA (Symdeko®) is approved in certain countries. VX-659 is a next-generation CFTR corrector being developed for administration in triple c ombination (TC) with TEZ/IVA for the treatment of CF. 5.2 Rationale for the Present Study Subjects who complete the last Treatment Period visit in a parent study and meet eligibility are eligible to enroll. Parent studies are Phase 3 Vertex studies investigating VX-659 in combination with TEZ and IVA. These include, but are not limited to, Study VX17-659-102 (Study 659- 102) and Study VX17-659-103 (Study 659-103). This study will provide data on the long-term safe ty, efficacy, and durability of VX-659 in TC with TEZ and IVA in subjects wi th CF who are homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del mutation."

The ICF and, when appropriate, assent form, can be signed up to 28 days prior to Day 1. After obtaining informed consent and confirming eligibilit y, subjects will receive the first dose of study drug on Day 1. Administration details are provided in Section 9.6. The Day 1 Visit of this study will be on the sa me day as the last scheduled visit of the parent study. S ubjects will NOT have to repeat any Day 1 assessments that were specified to be performed at the last scheduled visit in the parent study . Subjects who were enrolled and remained clinically stable but had Day 1 study drug administration procedures delayed by no more than 7 days for reasons not related to their clinical status will have to repeat the safety (Secti on 11.7) and spirometry (Section 11.6.1) assessments that we re specified to be performed at the Day 1 Visit before receiving their first dose of study drug. Subjects who have not received the first dose of stud y drug within 7 days of the last dose of study drug in the parent study, or subjects who had Da y 1 study drug administration procedures delayed by no more than 7 days for a reason related to clinical status, will have to repeat all Day 1 assessments. 9 .1.2 Safety Follow- up The Safety Follow-up Visit is scheduled to occur 28 (± 7) days after the last dose of study drug. The Safety Follow-up Visit assessments a re listed in Table 3-1. The Safety Follow-up Visit is re quired for all subjects. However, subjects who transition within 28 days of the last dose of study drug to either a commercially available or managed access program-supplied next-generation corrector TC regimen, or to another qualified Vertex study, will complete the Week 96 Visit (or the ETT Visit, if the transition occurs before the Week 96 Visit). In these cases, the Week 96 Visit (or the ETT Visit) will replace the Safety Follow-up Visit. For subjects who complete an ETT Visit 3 wee ks or later following the last dose of study drug, the ETT Visit will replace the Safety Follow-up Visit (Section 9.1.3).

If the ETT Visit occurs 3 weeks or later following the last dose of study drug, then the ETT Visit will replace the Safety Follow -up Visit, and a separate Safety Follow-up Visit will not be required. During the course of study conduct, if local health authorities decline to approve the TC of VX-659/TEZ/IVA due to the emergence of a negative benefit/risk profile, or if clinical benefit is not demonst rated for the use of the TC for the treatme nt of CF in specific subpopulations enrolled in this study, subjects with the relevant CFTR genotypes may be discontinued after c ommunication to investigators and IRBs/IECs of the risks/benefits related to the safety and efficacy observed for the relevant subset of subjects. If a subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent or assent, no further assessments will be performed. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data and samples collected before such withdrawal of consent or assent. 9.1.4 Lost to Follow- up A subject will be considered lost to follow-up if both of the following occur:  The subject misses 2 consecutive study visits (telephone contact and/or clinic visit) and is subsequently unable to be contacted by telephone (3 documented attempts by telephone within 2 weeks following the second missed visit)  The subject does not respond within 2 weeks to a registered letter sent after the 3 attempted telephone contacts. 9.1.5 Comple tion of Study Participation Completion of study participation for each individual subject is defined as: the Safety Follow-up Visit; or, in situations in which the ETT Visit or the Week 96 Visit replace the Safety Follow-up Visit (Section 9.1.2), the ETT Visit or the Week 96 Visit. I f subjects withdraw consent or assent, c ompletion of study participation is defined as date of withdrawal of consent or assent, whichever is earlier (Section 9.9). If subjects are lost to follow-up (Sec tion 9.1.4), the date of completion of study participation will be defined as the date of last contact. The end of study is defined in Section 13.2.8. 9.1.6 Independent Data Monitoring Committ ee This study will be monitored by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), which will conduct periodic reviews of safety data (Section 12.3.6.2 ). Procedural details of the IDMC structure and func tion, frequency of meetings, and data planned for review will be included in the IDMC charter. The IDMC charter will be finalized before the first subject is enrolled. 9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups This is an open-label study. Randomization is not required because all subjects will be treated identically in a single cohort."

Results from this study will provide information on the long-term safety and efficacy of TC treatment with VX-659/TEZ/IVA in subjects with CF who are aged 12 years and older and homozygous or heterozygous for the F508del mutation, as per the populations enrolled in the parent studies. 9.3.2 Study Drug Dose and Duration All subjects will receive a TC of VX-659/TEZ/IVA at the same dosage as that in the parent studies (including, but not limited to, Study 659-102 and Study 659-103). The overa ll treatment duration will be 96 weeks. This duration was employed in open-label extension studies for previously approved CFTR modulators, Kalydeco and Orkambi, and is considered sufficient for the evaluation of long-term safety and efficacy. 9.3.3 Rationale for Study Assessments All safety assessments are standard parameters for clinical studies in drug development. The PD and efficacy parameters being evaluated (e.g., SwCl, spirometry, PEx, anthropometric measurements, and patient-reported outcomes) are widely accepted and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant to the study of patients in CF. These parameters were routinely measured in the parent studies, as well as the registration studies of IVA (Kalydeco) or LUM/IVA combination therapy (Orkambi). 9.4 Study Restrictions 9.4.1 Prohibited Medications Table 9-1 lists prohibited medications. A non-exhaustive list of study prohibitions and cautions for medica tion will be provided in the Study Reference Manual."
22,page_22,"Protocol VX17- 659-105, Version 3.0 P age 23 of 57 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Table 9-1 Prohibited Medications Medication Timing of Restriction Rationale Start of Restriction End of Restriction Moderate and strong CYP3A or CYP2C9 inducers None allowed within 14 days before the first dose of the study drug on Day 1 None allowed through completion of study participation VX-659, TEZ, and IVA are metabolized extensively via CYP3A4. VX-659 is also metabolized by CYP2C9. Therefore, use of moderate and strong inducers of CYP3A or CYP2C9 and moderate and strong inhibitors of CYP3A, which have the potential to alter the exposure of VX -659, TEZ, or IVA, will be prohibited. Moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors (except ciprofloxacin)a None allowed within 14 days before the first dose of the study drug on Day 1 None allowed through completion of study participation Sensitive OATP1B1 substrates None allowed within 14 days before the first dose of the study drug on Day 1 None allowed through completion of study participation VX-659 is a potential inhibitor of the hepatic transporter OATP1B1. Therefore, sensitive substrates of OATP1B1, such as HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors (“statins”) are prohibited during treatment. CFTR modulators (investigational or approved), except for study drug in the parent studies and this study None allowed within 14 days before the first dose of the study drug on Day 1 None allowed through completion of study participation These agents may confound the results of this study.

Stable treatment regimen is defined as the current treatment regimen for CF that subjects have been following for at least 28 days before Day 1. Subjects should not initiate long -term treatment with new medication from 28 days before the Day 1 Visit through completi on of study participation. Subjects who are taking inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics should remain on that regimen throughout the study.  S ubjects may receive doses of prednisone or prednisolone of up to 10 mg/day chronically, or up to 60 mg daily for up to 5 days."

Additional information is provided in the Pharmacy Manual. Study drug will be administered with a fat-containing meal or snack, such as a standard “CF” meal or snack or a standard meal. 1. I t is recommended that the dose be taken within 30 minutes of the start of the meal or snack. 2. S tudy drug will be administered as 2 fixed-dose combination (FDC) TC tablets in the morning and as 1 IVA tablet in the evening. For each subject, doses of study drug will be taken at approximately the same time (± 2 hours) each day. 3. The date, amount taken, and time of study drug administration, including whether food was taken with each dose, will be recorded for the 2 doses before pharmacokinetic (PK) sample collecti on (Week 4) and the dose received on the morning of PK sample collection (Week 4). 4. On da ys of scheduled visits, the morning dose of TC will be administered at the site after predose assessments have been completed. A meal or snack will be provided by the site for the morning dose of TC. 5. I f a subject’s scheduled visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines must be used:  I f the dose in the clinic will be within 6 hours of the subject’s scheduled morning dose , the subject should withhold their morning dose of TC and the morning dose of TC will be administered in the clinic.  I f the dose in the clinic will be more than 6 hours after the subject’s scheduled morning dose of TC, the subjec t should take the morning dose of TC at home. 6. S ubjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused materials associated with the study drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, as appropriate. 9.6.2 Missed Doses 9.6.2.1 Morning Dose of Study Drug If a subject misses the morning dose of TC and recalls within 6 hours, the subject should take his/her dose with food. I f more than 6 hours but fewer than 12 hours have elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the subjec t should take the morning dose of TC but skip the evening dose of IVA. If more than 12 hours have elapsed after his/her usual dosing time, the subject should skip the morning dose of T C and take the evening dose of IVA. 9.6.2.2 Evening Dose of Study Drug If a subject misses the evening dose of IVA and recalls within 6 hours, the subject should take his/her dose with food.

Treatment may be interrupted as outlined in Section 9.8. If any unacceptable toxicity arises, individual subjects will discontinue dosing (Sec tion 9.1.3). 9 .8 Study Drug Interruption and Stopping Rules The medical monitor should be notified of an interruption of study drug that lasts >72 hours for any reason and of the resumption of study drug after such interruption. 9.8.1 Liver Function Tests The central laboratory will notify the medical monitor of ALT or AST >3 × ULN and total bilirubin >2 × ULN tha t are derived from centrally submitted samples. Subjects with new trea tment-emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3 × upper limit of normal (ULN), with or without total bil irubin >2 × ULN, must be followed closely, including confirmatory testing performed by the central laboratory within 48 to 72 hours of the initial finding and subsequent c lose monitoring of ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels, as clinically indicated. If a subject cannot return to the site for confirmatory testing, a local laboratory may be used. Local laboratory results must be reported immediately to the medical monitor, and the subject must have the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 72 hours). Study drug administration must be interrupted immediately (prior to confirmatory testing) if any of the following criteria are met:  ALT or AST >8 × ULN  ALT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks  A LT or AST >3 × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice A thorough investig ation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be followed closely for clinical progression. Study drug administration must be discontinued if the following criterion is met:  Subsequent ALT or AST values confirm the initial elevation that satisfied the interruption rule (above), and no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, alcohol ingestion) is identified, regardl ess of whether transaminase levels have improved. All subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases (and bilirubin, as applicable) should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline. If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation with or without increased bilirubin or clinical jaundice has been identified, study drug administration may be resumed once transaminases return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, whichever is higher. Regardless of the dura tion of interruption, the medical monitor should be notified prior to resumption of study drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases and bilirubin should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a protocol-defined transaminase elevation interruption threshold recurs within"
25,page_25,"Protocol VX17- 659-105, Version 3.0 P age 26 of 57 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 4 weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by repeat testin g within 48 to 72 hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless of the presumed etiology. 9 .8.2 Rash Individuals who de velop a gener alized rash will be monitored closely. Study drug dosing should be interrupted if a subject develops a generalized rash of Grade 3 or higher, or a rash that is considered a serious adverse event. The investigator will notify the medical monitor of any rash that results in interruption of study drug, is Grade 3 or higher (Section 13.1.1.4), or is a serious a dverse event (SAE). Investigators should consider additional evaluation including laboratory testing (e.g., complete blood count [CBC] with differential, LFTs), photographs of the rash, and dermatology consultation. The investigator may consider resumption of study drug if considered clinically appropriate. 9.9 Removal of Subjects Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request. Subjects may be withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Vertex for safety, behavior, noncompliance with study procedures, or administrative reasons. If a subject has been withdrawn from study drug treatment, the subject will continue to be followed, provided that the subject has not withdrawn consent (and assent, as applicable). In addition, a subject must be discontinued from study drug treatment if the subject meets any of the following criteria:  Mee ts any of the stopping (discontinuation) criteria (Section 9.7)  B ecomes pregnant (Section 11.7.7.2) If a subject does not r eturn for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact the subject. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome. The investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for an ETT Visit and Safety Follow-up Visit, if applicable (see Section 9.1.3), and follow up with the subject regarding any unresolved AEs. If the subject withdraws c onsent or assent for the study, no further assessments will be performed. Vertex may retain and continue using the study data and samples after the study is over, and may use the samples and information in the development of the study compound, and for other drugs and diagnostics, in publications and presentations, and for education purposes. If the subject withdraws from the study, the study data and samples collected will remain part of the study. A subject will not be able to request the withdrawal of his/her information from the study data. A subject may request destruction of the samples collected from him/her during the study as long as those samples can be identified as his/her samples. If evaluation of effi cacy data from the parent studies suggests that the VX-659/TEZ/IVA treatment does not provide clinically meaningful benefit for subsets of subjects included in these studies, Vertex may reco mmend that subjects with relevant genotypes discontinue from the study. In addition, if local health authorities decline to approve VX-659/TEZ/IVA, or if clinical benefit is not demonstrated for the use of VX-659/TEZ/IVA for the treatment of CF in specific subpopulations enrolled in this study, subjects with the relevant CFTR genotypes may be"

Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused materials associated with the study drug to the site. These materials will be retained at the site according to instructions provided by Vertex or its designee. The study monitor will review study drug records and inventory throug hout the study."
27,page_27,"Protocol VX17- 659-105, Version 3.0 P age 28 of 57 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated If a site uses a site-specific drug accountability system and/or process, including processes associated with the destruction of returned materials, the process must be documented and approved by Vertex. The study monitor must review the drug accountability documentation on a regular basis. The study moni tor will promptly communicate to Vertex any discrepancies he/she is unable to resolve with the site. 10.5 Disposal, Return, or Retention of Unused Drug The study site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials returned by the subjects until the study monitor has performed drug accountability. The investigator will ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Vertex. Destruction will be adequately documented. 10.6 Compliance To ensure treatment compliance, the investigator or designee will supervise all study drug dosing that occurs at the site. At each visit, site personnel will review that the subject is compliant with study drug dosing and remind the subject of study drug dosing requirements. Compliance will also be assessed by ongoing study drug count. If a subject demonstrates continued noncompliance of study drug dosing despite educational efforts, the investigator should consider discontinuing the subject from the study. 10.7 Blinding and Unblinding This will be an open-label study. However, as outlined in Section 11.4 and Section 11.6.1, subjects (and their parents/ca regivers/companions) should not be informed of their study-related spirometry and SwCl results until Vertex has determined that the study has completed (i.e., CSR finalization). Individual SwCl test results will also not be disclosed to the study sites. In addition, the Vertex study team will not ha ve access to the spirometry or SwCl results of the present study until the database lock of the parent study. 11 ASSESSMENTS 11.1 Timing of Assessments The timing of assessments is shown in Section 3 and Table 3-1. 11.2 Subject and Disease Characteristics Subject and disease characteristics include the following: demographics, medical history, height, and weight.

P re-bronchodilator spirometry is defined as spirometry testing performed for subjects who have  withheld their shor t-acting bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol) or anticholinergic (e.g., ipratropium bromide [Atrovent®]) for more than 4 hours before the spirometry assessment;  withheld their long -acting bronchodilator (e.g., salmeterol) for more than 12 hours before the spirometry assessment; and  withheld their onc e-daily, long-acting bronchodilator (e.g., tiotropium bromide [Spiriva®]) for more than 24 hours before the spirometry assessment. All spirometry assessme nts should be performed pre-bronchodilator. During the Treatment Period, spirometry assessments must be performed before study drug dosing (Section 9.6.1) at a pproximately the same time at each visit. In the event that a subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator(s), spirometry should be performed according to the following:  I f a subject’s Day 1 spirometry assessment from the parent study is pre-bronchodilator, but on a subsequent visit in this study, the subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator use, a post- bronchodilator spirometry a ssessment will be obtained for that visit only and the visit will not be rescheduled.  I f, on Day 1 of the parent study, the subject forgot to withhold his/her dose of bronchodilator, spirometry should be perfor med post-bronchodilator and all subsequent spirometric"

A definition of non-childbearing potential is provided in Section 11.7.7.1 . Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at the study site and analyzed at the central laboratory. Urine pregnancy tests will either be perfor med and analyzed at the site or, at assessment time points when telephone contact takes the place of a clinic visit, at home by using a home kit provided by the site. Results of a home urine pregnancy test will be reported to the site by telephone. The urine pregnancy test on Day 1 must be negative before the first dose of study drug. Additional pregnancy tests may be re quired according to local regulations and/or requirements. Follicle-stimulating Hormone (FSH): Blood samples for FSH will be measured as needed for any suspected postmenopausal female with at least 12 months of continuous spontaneous amenorrhea. Se rum FSH levels must be in the postmenopausal range as determined by the laboratory performing the test. Additional Evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other times if judged to be clinically appropriate. For the purposes of study conduct and unless noted otherwise, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal result.

Statistical analysis details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP), and clinical pharmacologic analysis details will be provided in the clinical pharmacology analysis plan (CPAP), both of which will be finalized before the clinical data lock for the study. 12.1 Sample Size and Power The primary and secondary objectives of the study are the evaluation of the long-term safety and tolerability, and long-term efficacy of VX-659 in TC with TEZ/IVA. This is an open-label study that will enroll subjects who complete the last Treatment Period visit in a parent study and meet eligibility criteria. Parent studies are Phase 3 Vertex studies investigating VX-659 in combination with TEZ and IVA. These include, but are not limited to, Study 659-102 and S tudy 659-103. Over 400 subjects are expected to enroll in this open-label study of 100 weeks duration. With thi s number of subjects exposed to VX-659/TEZ/IVA treatment, AEs by Preferred Term (PT) that occur with a frequency of >1% will be ruled out with 95% confidence, when zero events are observed in that PT. Further, with over 400 subjects exposed to VX-659/TEZ/IVA treatment for at least 24 weeks, the half-width of the 95% CI for estimating the cumulative incidence of PEx of C F is less than 6% assuming an observed incidence of 30%. 12.2 Analysis Sets The Open-label All Subjects Set is defined as all subjects who were enrolled (defined as subject having data in the clinical database) in the open-label study. This analysis set will be used for indi vidual subject data listings and disposition summary tables unless otherwise specified. The Open-label Full Analysis Set (OL-FAS) is defined as all enrolled subjects who have received at least 1 dose of study drug in the open-label study. The OL- FAS will be used to summarize subject demographics and baseline characteristics and for all efficacy analyses unless otherwise specified. The Open-label Safety Set (OL- SS) is defined as all subjects who have received at least 1 dose of study drug in the open-label study. The OL-SS will be used for all safety analyses unless otherwise specified. 12.3 Statistical Analysis 12.3.1 General Considerations Continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: the numbe r of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max). The precision of the measurement for each continuous variable will be specified in the SAP. Unless otherwise specified, min and max values will be reported with the same precision as"
38,page_38,"Protocol VX17- 659-105, Version 3.0 P age 39 of 57 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated the units of the raw data. The mean, median, and SD will be reported to 1 additional decimal place. Any values that require a transformation to standard units (metric or SI) will be converted with the appropriate precision. Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. Percentages will be pr esented to 1 decimal place. The baselin e value , unless otherwise specified, for the long-term safety analysis will be the most recent non- missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of VX-659 in TC with TEZ/IVA either in the parent study or the open-label study, as applicable. T he baseli ne value for the long-term efficacy analysis will be defined as the most recent non-missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study dr ug in the parent study. For assessments collected in duplicate or triplicate, the baseline will be defined as the average of non-missing values. Baseline ch aracteristics of subjects in the open-label study will be the same as the baseline c haracteristics in the parent study. Change (absolute change) from baseline will be calculated as post-baseline value - baseline va lue. The Efficacy Analysis Period in the open-label study will include the time from the first dose of study drug in the open-label study to the last scheduled efficacy visit in the open-label study, unless otherwise specifie d. The Treatment- eme rgent (TE) Period in the open-label study will include the time from the fir st dose of study drug in the open-label study to 28 days after the last dose of the study drug in the open-labe l study or to the completion date of study participation (as defined in Section 9.1.5), whic hever occurs first. The long-term efficacy analysis will be performed by parent study for the Efficacy Analysis Period in the open-label study, with the only exception of time to first PEx where events in the parent st udy may also be included. In general, long-term safety analysis will be performed in a pooled fashion. 12.3.2 Background Characteristics 12.3.2.1 Subject Disposition Subject disposition will be summarized for the Open-label All Subjects Set.

The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized for the OL-FAS and will include (but not limited to) sex, race, ethnicity, baseline age, baseline weight, baseline height, baseline BMI, baseline ppFEV 1, baseline SwCl, and baseline score of CFQ-R respiratory domain. Medical history will be summarized by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and PT for the OL-FAS. No statistical tests will be carried out to evaluate any baseline imbalance between treatment groups. 12.3.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Medications Medications will be coded using the World Health Organization-Drug Dictionary and categorized as follows:  P rior medication: any medication that was administered during the 56 days before the first dose of study drug in the open-label study  Conco mitant medication: medication continued or newly received during the TE Period in the open-label study  P ost-treatment medication: medication continued or newly received after the TE Period in the open-label study A g iven medication may be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or a post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post-treatment; or pr ior, concomitant, and post-treatment. If a medication has a missing or partially missing start/end date or time and if it cannot be determined whether it was taken before initial dosing in the open-label study, concomitantly during the TE Period in the open-label study, or beyond the TE Period i n the open-label study, it will be considered in all 3 categories of prior, concomitant, a nd post-treatment medication. Prior medications and concomitant medications will be summarized descriptively by Preferred Name based on the OL-FAS. Post-treatment medications will be provided separately in an individual subject data listing. 12.3.2.4 Study Drug Exposure and Compliance Study drug exposure will be summarized for the OL-SS in terms of treatment a subject received in the open-label study (in days), defined as the last day of study drug in the open-label stud y minus the first day of study drug in the open-label study plus 1, regardless of study drug interr uption. Study drug compliance will be summarized overall and by treatment group based on the OL-FAS, and will be calculated as: 100  [1 - (total number of days of study drug interruption in"

A study dru g interruption on a given day is defined as an interruption of any study drug on that day. In addition, percentage of tablets taken in the open-label study will also be summarized overall and by treatment group based on the OL-FAS, and will be calculated as 100  [(total number of table ts dispensed in the open-label study) – (total number of tablets returned in the open-label stud y)] / (total number of tablets planned to be taken per day  duration of study drug exposure in da ys for the open-label study). 12.3.2.5 Important Protocol Deviations An important protocol deviation (IPD) is a deviation that may significantly affect the completeness, accuracy, or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a subject’s rights, safety, or well-being. The rules for identifying an IPD in the open-label study will be de scribed in the SAP. All IPDs will be provided in an individual subject data listing, and summarized, as appropriate. 12.3.3 Efficacy and Pharmacodynamic Analyses The secondary objectives of the study are the evaluation of the long-term efficacy and PD of VX-659 in TC with TEZ/IVA. 1 2.3.3.1 Analysis of Primary Variables Not applicable since efficacy and pharmacodynamics are not primary objectives. 1 2.3.3.2 Analysis of Secondary Variables The secondary variables include:  Abso lute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 One of the secondary efficacy endpoints is the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at visits in the open-label study, for subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug in the open-label stud y. The primary analysis for this secondary endpoint will be based on a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) for each individual parent study, with the absolute change from ba seline in ppFEV 1 as the dependent variable for visits in the open-label study. The details including sensitivity analyses and supportive analysis will be described in the SAP.  Abso lute change from baseline in SwCl Analysis of this PD variable will be based on an MMRM model similar to the analysis of the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1.  Num ber of PEx The analysis of the number of PEx starting from the first dose of TC in the parent/open-label study will be performed using a negative binomial regression model for each individual parent study, unless otherwise specified.  Time- to-first PEx Time- to-first PEx is defined as the number of days starting from the first dose of TC in the parent/open-label study to the first event of PEx.

This includes any newly"
45,page_45,"Protocol VX17- 659-105, Version 3.0 P age 46 of 57 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity or frequency) a fter the ICF is signed. An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section 13.1.2.1. 1 3.1.1.2 Clinically Significant Assessments Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, PEs, and vital signs will be assessed and those deemed to have clinically-significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be provided, rather than the abnormal test result alone (e.g., urinary tract infection, anemia). In the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study asses sment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased hemoglobin). An abnorma l study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1 or more of the following:  Concomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment  F urther diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  A c hange in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by the investigator. A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4 laboratory value will be an SAE if the subject’s c linical status indicates a life-threatening AE. 13.1.1.3 Documentation of Adverse Events All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the subject completes study participation, as defined in Section 9.1.5. All subjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the CRF and sourc e document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled in the study will be recorded only in the subject’s source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE:  De scription of the event  Classification of “serious” or “nonserious”  Da te of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  Severity  Causal relationship to study drug(s)  Ac tion taken  Outcome  Concomitant medication or other treatment given"
46,page_46,"Protocol VX17- 659-105, Version 3.0 P age 47 of 57 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated 13.1.1.4 Adverse Event Severity The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The guidance avail able at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, http://ctep.cancer. gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm (Accessed 28 September 2017). AEs of CTCAE Grades 4 and 5 will be documented as “life-threatening.” I n c onsidering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those given in the CTCAE. The severity of an AE that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in Table 13-1. Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity Classification Definition Mild (Grade 1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities Moderate (Grade 2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities Severe (Grade 3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities Life-threatening (Grade 4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death 13.1.1.5 Adverse Event Causality Every effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories presented in Table 13-2. Table 13-2 Classifications for AE Causality Classification Definition Related There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational study drug. Possibly rela ted There is an association between the event and the administration of the investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative etiology, such as charact eristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease. Unlikely related The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be related to factors other than investigational study drug. Not related The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the alternative etiology will be documented in the study subject’s medical record). 13.1.1.6 Study Drug Action Taken The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-3."
47,page_47,"Protocol VX17- 659-105, Version 3.0 P age 48 of 57 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Table 13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE Classification Definition Dose not changed Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE Dose reduced Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE Drug interrupted Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE Drug withdrawn Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE Not applicable Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply. “Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible. 13.1.1.7 Adverse Event Outcome An AE will be followed until the investigator has determined and provided the final outcome. The outcome will be classified according to the categories shown in Table 13-4. Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE Classification Definition Recovered/resolved Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms Recovered/resolved with sequelae Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms Not recovered/not resolved (continuing) Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains ongoing Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at leas t possibly related to the AE. Unknown Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to follow -up) 13.1.1.8 Treatment Given The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. 13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 13.1.2.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  F atal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after participation in the study and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study drug)  L ife-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred  Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization"
48,page_48,"Protocol VX17- 659-105, Version 3.0 P age 49 of 57 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated  P ersistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  C ongenital anomaly or birth defect  I mportant medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed a bove (e.g., an allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home) If a subject has a hospitalization or procedure (e.g., surgery) for an event or condition that oc curred before the subject signed the ICF, and the hospitalization or procedure was planned before the subject signed the ICF, the hospitalization or procedure will not be considered to indicate an SAE, unless an AE caused the hospitalization or procedure to be rescheduled sooner or to be prolonged relative to what was planned. In addition, hospitalizations clearly not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be c onsidered to indicate an SAE. Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations. 1 3.1.2.2 Documentation of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent through completion of study participation, regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to Vertex GPS. In addition, all SAEs that occur after completion of study participation and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours . SAEs will be recorded on the Vertex Organized Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relationship to the investigational study drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report to Vertex the outcome of the event using the SAE Form. 13.1.2.3 Reporting Serious Adverse Events The investigator is responsible for notifying the sponsor within 24 hours of identifying an SAE, re gardless of the presumed relationship to the investigational study drug. The SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow-up information on previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow-up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities."

58,page_58,"Clinical Study Protocol Addendum for Cystic Fibrosis, Addendum Version 3.0 Page 2 of 8 Vertex Pharmac euticals Incorporated Summary of Changes to Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Study Protocols Vertex is currently evaluating several CFTR modulators in clinical studies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF), a serious and life -threatening disease. In completed studies, treatment with these CFTR modulators has generally resulted in rapid, robust, clinically meaningful, and statistically significant improvements in clinical measures, and are generally safe and well tolerated. A dverse events (AEs) seen with these treatments are mostly consistent with common manifestations of CF disease or with common illnesses in CF subjects. During this COVID -19 pand emic, the safety of the subjects, investigators, and site personnel participating in these clinical studies is Vertex’s first priority, thus it is important to minimize any unnecessary risk to COVID -19 exposure through travel to study sites. This addendum summarizes the measures taken for ongoing CF clinical studies. These operational adjustments were implemented to align with Health Authority guidance ensuring the protection of subjects, investigators, and site personnel while maintaining compliance with G CP and minimizing impact to the integrity of the studies. Overall, the benefit -risk of these studies remains favorable. Vertex recommends that subjects and sites refer to local guidance regarding travel restrictions. There are no operational changes to the study protocols for subjects who can travel to the study sites for their visits. However, to ensure continued safety of subjects who cannot travel to the study sites for their visits (for any reason due to COVID -19), specific alternative measures are being implemented to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID -19 (see table below). As the COVID -19 pandemic evolves, Vertex will continue to assess the need for additional actions to ensure the safety of all involved in these clinical studies. Addendum Vers ion 3.0 summarizes additional measures taken for these ongoing CF clinical studies (see table below) to ensure continued safety."
