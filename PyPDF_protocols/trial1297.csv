3,page_3,"Protocol VX18- 445-104, Version 2.0 P age 4 of 69 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information Number of Subjects Approximately 250 subjects will be enrolled in the study:  Approximately 40% of total subjects will be in the IVA comparator group (approximately 100 subjects) o In the IVA comparator group, up to 20% of subjects may be enrolled with an R117H mutation (approximately 20 subjects)  Up to 15% of total subjects may be enrolled with SwCl values <30 mmol/L at screening (approximately 40 subjects) Subjects will be randomiz ed (1:1) to the VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment arm or the control arm (IVA or TEZ/IVA). Study Population Male and female CF subjects 12 years of age or older with F/G and F/RF genotypes Investigational Drug During the Run -in Period, study drug refers to TEZ/IVA and IVA, as applicable. During the Treatment Period, study drug refers to VX -445/TEZ/IVA and matching placebo, TEZ/IVA and matching placebo, and IVA and matching placebo, as applicable. Active study drugs will be orally administered as fixed -dose c ombination (FDC) film -coated tablets of VX -445/TEZ/IVA or TEZ/IVA and film -coated IVA tablets. Active substance: VX-445/TEZ/IVA Activity: VX-445 is a CFTR corrector, TEZ is a CFTR corrector, and IVA is a CFTR potentiator (increased Clˉ secretion) Strength: 100 mg/50 mg/75 mg FDC tablet Active substance: TEZ/IVA Activity: CFTR corrector and CFTR potentiator (increased Clˉ secretion) Strength: 100 mg/150 mg FDC tablet Active substance: IVA Activity: CFTR potentiator (increased Clˉ secretion) Strength: 150 mg tablet Study Duration The total study duration is approximately 20 weeks (4 weeks for the Screening Period, 4 weeks for the Run -in Period, 8 weeks for the Treatment Period, and 4 weeks for the Safety Follow -up Period). Study Design This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, active -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter study (Figure 2-1). In the Run -in Period, subjects will be assigned to the IVA or TEZ/IVA comparator group based on genotype. S ubjects assigned to the IVA comparator group will receive IVA 150 mg every 12 hours (q12h) and subjects assigned to the TEZ/IVA comparator group will receive TEZ 100 mg once daily (qd)/IVA 150 mg q12h (Table 2-1). In the Treatment Period, subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the VX -445/TEZ/IVA treatment arm or control arm under a single randomization scheme. Subjects in the control arm who received IV A in the Run -in Period will receive IVA in the Treatment Period; subjects in the control arm who received TEZ/IVA in the Run -in Period will receive TEZ/IVA in the Treatment Period. Randomization will be stratified based on comparator group (IVA comparator versus TEZ/IVA comparator), ppFEV 1 as determined during the Run -in Period (Day -14 assessment; <70 versus ≥70), and SwCl as determined during the Run -in Period (Day -14 assessment; <30 mmol/L versus ≥30 mmol/L).

5,page_5,"Protocol VX18- 445-104, Version 2.0 P age 6 of 69 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information for the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group. The primary null hypothesis to be tested is that the mean absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through Week 8 is 0 for the VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment grou p. The null hypothesis will be tested at a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05. For the primary hypothesis, assuming a within -group SD of 7.0 percentage points and a 10% dropout rate at Week 8, a sample size of 125 subjects in the VX -445/TEZ/IVA arm will have >99% power to detect the within -group difference of 3.0 percentage points (1 sample t-test at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05). The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model will include the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Day 15, Week 4, and Week 8 as the dependent variable; treatment group, visit, and treatment by visit as fixed effects; with continuous baseline ppFEV 1, continuous baseline SwCl, and comparator group (I VA comparator versus TEZ/IVA comparator) as covariates; and an unstructured covariance structure for the within -subject errors. For the primary endpoint, the results obtained from the model will be the estimated within -treatment difference through Week 8 ( average of Week 4 and Week 8) for the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group. The same model will be used to estimate between group differences (difference between VX-445/TEZ/IVA and the control group) through Week 8. The adjusted mean with a 2 -sided 95% CI and a 2 -sided P value will be provided for the primary endpoint and second key secondary endpoints. The safety endpoints include AEs, clinical laboratory values, ECGs, vital signs, and pulse oximetry through completion of study participation. The safety analyses will be descriptive only. IDMC Reviews An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) will conduct safety reviews of study data as outlined in the IDMC charter. Page 19 of 561"

CF affects more than 70,000 individuals worldwide1 (approximately 30,000 in the US2 and 45,000 in the EU3) . Based on its prevalence, CF qualifies as an orphan disease .4, 5 CF is caused by decreased quantity and/or function of the CFTR protein due to mutations in the CFTR gene .6 CFTR is an ion channel that regulates the flow of chloride and other ions across e pithelia in various tissues, including the lungs, pancreas and other gastrointestinal organs, and sweat glands.7 Decreased CFTR quantity or function results in the failure to regulate chloride transport in these tissues leading to the multisystem pathology associated with CF .8 In the lungs, obstruction of airways with thick mucus, establishment of a chronic bacterial infection in the airways, and damaging inflammatory responses are all thought to play a role in causing irreversible structural changes in the lungs, leading to respiratory failure. Progressive loss of lung function is the leading cause of mortality .9 The most common disease-causing CFTR mutation is F508de l, which accounts for approximately 70% of the identified alleles in people with CF .10 Approximately 40% to 45% of pe ople with CF are homozygous for F508del (F/F), and approximately 85% have at least 1 F508del a llele.2, 3 Based on the understanding of the molecular defects caused by CFTR mutations, 2 complementary approaches have been developed to address the decreased quantity and/or func tion of CFTR in order to enhance chloride transport in patients with CF. Correctors facilitate the cellular processing and trafficking to increase the quantity of CFTR at the cell surface. Potentiators increase the channel open probability (channel gating activity) of the CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface to enhance ion transport. With differing mechanisms of action, a combination of correctors and potentiators increases F508del CFTR-mediated chloride transport more than either type of modul ator alone. The therapeutic activity of CFTR modulators has been established with products developed by Vertex and approved for the treatment of CF: ivacaftor (IVA) monotherapy (Kalydeco ), lumacaftor (LUM)/IVA (Orkambi®), and tezacaftor (TEZ)/IVA (Symdeko /Symkevi®). VX-445 is a next-generation CFTR corrector. In vitro, the triple combination (TC) of VX-445, TEZ, and IVA (VX-445/TEZ/IVA) increased CFTR chloride transport more than any of the dual combinations (VX-445/TEZ, VX-445/IVA, and TEZ/IVA) or individual components ( VX-445, TEZ , and IVA) when added to human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells derived from 2 groups of CF patients: those heterozygous for F508del with a second C FTR allele carrying a minimal func tion (MF) mutation that is not responsive to TEZ, IVA, and TEZ/IVA (F/MF genotypes); and those homozygous for F508del (F/F genotypes). Additional information about VX-445/TEZ/IVA can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 5 .2 Study Rationale This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of VX-445/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects who are heterozygous for F508del and a second CFTR allele carrying either a gating mutation or a Page 33 of 561"

Results from the Phase 1/2 study showed that treatment with VX-445/TEZ/IVA resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppFEV 1) and sweat chloride (SwCl) in CF subj ects with 1 or 2 copies of the F508del mutation, namely those with F/MF and F/F genotypes (f or the latter, as compared to their TEZ/IVA baseline).

25,page_25,"Protocol VX18- 445-104, Version 2.0 P age 26 of 69 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information Screening assessments will be used to confirm that subjects meet the eligibility criteria (Table 3-1 ). The investigator (or an appropriate authorized designee) will obtain informed consent and assent, if applicable, from each subject bef ore any study procedure takes place. 9.1.1.1 Repetition of Screening Assessment(s) Screening assessments may be repeated once to establish study eligibility. If repeat values of the individual assessment(s) are within the eligibility criteria and completed within the screening window, then the subject is eligible for the study. 9.1.1.2 Rescreening Subjects who have not entered the Run-in Period may be rescreened once. If a subject is rescreened, all screening assessments will be repeated, except for the following assessments, which are not required to be repeated:  C FTR genotyping  F ollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) level (if serum FSH level was in the postmenopausal range as determined by the laboratory performing the test during prior screening)  Ophthalmologic examination (OE) (if performed within 3 months of the date of informed consent, for subjects <18 years of age) If a subje ct is rescreened, a new screening window will begin when the first rescreening assessment has been initiated. 9.1.1.3 Extension of Screening Period Window A subject may have the Screening Period window extended by 2 weeks for the following reasons:  R epetition of the Screening Period assessments (Section 9.1.1.1)  Une xpected operational or logistic delays, or to meet the eligibility criteria  S cheduling of OE (for subjects <18 years of age on the date of informed consent, Section 11.6.6) 9.1.2 Run-in Period The Run-in Period has a 4- week duration and is designed to establish a reliable on-treatment (IVA for the IVA comparator group and TEZ/IVA for the TEZ/IVA comparator group) baseline for the Treatment Period. The first dose of open-label IVA or TEZ/IVA (as applicable) will be administered at the Day -28 Visit. The last dose of open-label IVA will be administered in the evening on Day -1 (1 day before the Day 1 Visit). A subject’s screening CFTR genotype m ust confirm eligibility before the subject enters the Run-in Period (Section 11.6.2 ). On Day -14, spirometry and SwCl will be assessed. The Day -14 spirometry and SwCl assessments will be used for stratification of randomization (Section 9.2). S ubjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the Run-in Period will not be randomized or participate in the Treatment Period (Section 9.1.5.1) and are not permitted to rescreen.

It will last approximately 8 weeks (Day 1 to Week 8). Study dru g administration details are provided in Section 9.6. R andomization will occur before the first dose of study drug during the Treatment Period and may occur on either Day -1 or Day 1, after the conditions b elow have been met. Randomization and stratification details are provided in Section 9.2. To randomize and enter the Treatment Period, subjects must have stable CF disease (a s judged by the investigator) and have remained on a stable CF treatment regimen during the Run-in Period. Female subjects must have a negative pregnancy test at Day 1 before receiving randomized study drug. If these conditions are not met (for example, if the subject has an acute upper or lower respiratory infection, PEx, or changes in therapy [including antibiotics] for sinopulmonary disease during the Run-in Period), the subject will be discontinued and will not be permitted to rescreen. Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the Treatment Period will remain in the study from the time of discontinuation of study drug treatment through the last scheduled study visit and complete the assessments for all study visits, as described in Section 9.1.5.2. 9.1.4 Safety Follow- up The Safety Follow-up Visit will occur approximately 28 days after the last dose of study drug for subjects who complete study drug dosing and for subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug dosing, as described in Section 9.1.5 ( Ta ble 3-2 ). An open-label study will be available for subjects who complete the Week 8 Visit and are eligible. The Safety Follow-up Visit is not required for subjects who complete the Week 8 Visit and enroll in an open-label study within 28 days after the last dose of study drug. 9.1.5 Early Termination of Treatment If a subject prematurely discontinues study drug treatment, an Early Termination of Treatment (ETT) Visit should be scheduled as soon as possible after the decision to discontinue treatment. Subjects who prematurely discontinue treatment will also be required to complete the Safety Follow-up Visit, approximately 28 days after their last dose of study drug. The assessments performed at the Safety Follow-up Visit are listed in Table 3-2. I f the ETT Visit occurs 3 weeks or later following the last dose of study drug, then the ETT Visit will replace the Safety Follow-up Visit, and a separate Safety Follow- up Visit will not be required. If a subject withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent or assent, no further assessments will be performed. Vertex may retain and continue to use any data and samples collected before such withdrawal of consent or assent. 9.1.5.1 Discontinuation During the Run-in Period Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the Run-in Period will not be randomized or participate in the Treatment Period (Section 9.1.3). These subjects will complete Page 40 of 561"

The Safety F ollow-up Visit will be their last visit in this study. 9.1.5.2 Discontinuation During the Treatment Period Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the Treatment Period will continue to complete all scheduled study visits for assessments following completion of the ETT Visit, as detailed in Table 3-2. These subjects will complete an ETT Visit and Safety Follow-up Visi t (as applicable; see Section 9.1.5). 9.1.6 Lost to Follow -up A subject will be considered lost to follow-up if both of the following occ ur:  The subject misses 2 consecutive study visits (telephone contact and/or clinic visit) and is subsequently unable to be contacted by telephone (3 documented attempts by telephone within 2 weeks following the second missed visit).  The subject does not respond within 2 weeks to a registered letter sent after the 3 attempted telephone contacts. 9.1.7 Completion of Study Participation C ompletion of study participation for each individual subject is defined as 1 of the following:  F or subjects who complete the Treatment Period and enter an open-label study within 28 days after the Week 8 Visit: the Week 8 Visit  For subjects who complete the Treatment Period and do not enter an open-label study within 28 days after the Week 8 Visit: the Safety Follow-up Visit  For subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the Treatment Period but do not withdraw consent (and assent, as applicable): the latest of the Week 8 Visit, ETT Visit, or Safety Follow-up Visit (if required)  F or subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment during the Run-in Period but do not withdraw consent (and assent, as applicable): the ETT or Safety Follow-up Visit (if required)  F or subjects who withdraw consent or assent: date of withdrawal of consent or assent, whichever is earlier (Section 9.9) If subjects are lost to follow-up (Section 9.1.6), the date of completi on of study participation will be defined as the date of the last contact. The end of study is defined in Section 13.2.8. 9.1.8 Independent Data Monitoring Committee This study will be monitored by an indep endent data monitoring committee (IDMC), which will conduct periodic safety reviews of study data (Section 12.3.6.2). Procedural details of the I DMC’s structure and function, frequency of meetings, and data planned for review will be included in the IDMC charter. The IDMC charter will be finalized before the first subject is screened. Page 41 of 561"
28,page_28,"Protocol VX18- 445-104, Version 2.0 P age 29 of 69 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information 9.2 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups Subjects will be randomized (1:1) to the VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment arm or the control arm ( IVA or TEZ/IVA). Randomization will be stratified based on comparator group (IVA comparator versus TEZ/IVA comparator), ppFEV 1 as determined during the Run-in Period (Day -14 assessment; <70 versus ≥70), a nd SwCl as determined during the Run-in P eriod (Day -14 assessment; <30 mmol/L versus ≥30 mmol/L). If the Day -14 ppF EV 1 or SwCl value(s) are not valid or not available, the most recent available valid value(s) will be used for stratification. An interactive web response system (IWRS) will be used to assign subjects to treatment. The randomization code list will be produced by Vertex Biometrics or a qualified randomization vendor. 9.3 Rationale for Study Elements 9.3.1 Study Design This Phase 3 study will assess the efficacy, PD, and safety of VX-445/TEZ/IVA therapy in CF subjects with F/G or F/RF genotypes. A randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study design has been selected to ascertain the effects of VX-445/TEZ/IVA while avoiding observer bias. IVA and TEZ/IVA are appropriate active controls because IVA is approved standard of care for treatment of patients with F/G genotypes and selected F/RF genotypes in some regions, and TEZ/IVA is approved for treatment of patients with selected F/RF genotypes in some regions. Subjects will be assigned to a comparator group per Table 9-1. To establish a reliable on-treatm ent (IVA or TEZ/IVA) baseline for comparison during the Treatment Period, a 4-week Run-in Period has been incorporated into the study design. The study has an 8-week treatment duration. Based on prior experience with approved CFTR modulators, 8 weeks is sufficient to assess the impact of TC on the endpoints being evaluated. Randomization will be stratified by comparator group (IVA comparator versus TEZ/IVA comparator) ( Table 9-1) and the subject’s ppFEV 1 (an index of disease severity) and SwCl va lues determined at the Day -14 Visit. 9.3.2 Study Population This study will enroll CF subjects with F/G or F/RF genotypes in regions where their genotype and age group are approved indications for treatment with IVA and/or TEZ/IVA. As described in Section 5.2, treatment with VX-445 /TEZ/IVA offers the potential for additional clinical benefit in these subjects, as compared to the standard of care CFTR modulator regimens that are currently approved for these genotype groups. Given the progressive nature of CF, there is a strong rationale for treating patients earlier in life. Experience with CFTR modulators in adolescent subjects ≥12 to <18 years of age, including with TEZ/IVA, suggests that the exposures and safety profile of VX-445/TEZ/IVA will be similar in adolescents and adults, which supports evaluation of VX-445/TEZ/IVA in adolescents in the present study. Adolescent subjects are currently being evaluated in ongoing Phase 3 studies (Study VX17-445-102 [Study 102] for F/MF subjects, Study VX17- 445-103 [Study 103] Page 42 of 561"
29,page_29,"Protocol VX18- 445-104, Version 2.0 P age 30 of 69 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information for F/F subjects, and open-label Study VX17-445-105 [Study 105] for both F/MF and F/F subjects). 9.3.3 Stu dy Drug Dose VX-445 Dosage A V X-445 dose of 200 mg qd will be administered. This is the dosing regimen that was evaluated in the Phase 3 pivotal studies of VX -445/TEZ/IVA in CF subjects with F/MF and F/F genotypes. TEZ and IVA Dosages TEZ will be administered as 100 mg qd and IVA will be administered as 150 mg q12h. This is the approved dosing regimen for Symdeko, which is now approved in certain countries. IVA monotherapy will be administered as 150 mg q12h, which is the approved dosing regimen for Kalydeco. Dosage for Subjects Aged 12 to 17 Years Phase 3 studies with IVA a nd TEZ/IVA have demonstrated similar exposures between adults (≥18 years old) and adolescent subjects ≥12 to <18 years of age. In Studies 102 and 103, adolescent subjects in the F/MF and F/F genotype groups are being evaluated at the same dose as adult subjects because VX-445, TEZ, and IVA exposures are expected to be similar in adolescent subjects and adults. Therefore, in the current study, all subjects (both adolescents and adults) will receive the same dose of VX-445/TEZ/IVA. 9.3.4 Rationale for Study Assessments The safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), efficacy, and PD assessments are standard parameters for clinical studies in drug development and are generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant to the study of CF subjects. Additional exploratory assessments will be obtained to explore inflammatory mediators and other biomarkers. 9.4 Study Restrictions 9.4.1 Prohibited Medications Table 9-3 lists prohibited medications. A non-exhaustive list of study prohibitions and cautions for medication will be provided in the Stud y R eference Manual. Guidance for concomitant medications is provided in Section 9.5.

30,page_30,"Protocol VX18- 445-104, Version 2.0 P age 31 of 69 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information Table 9-3 Prohibited Medications Medication Timing of Restriction Rationale Start of Restriction End of Restriction Moderate and strong CYP3A inducers None allowed after the first dose of study drug on Day -28 None allowed through completion of study participation VX-445, TEZ, and IVA are metabolized extensively via CYP3A4. Therefore, use of moderate and strong inducers and inhibitors of CYP3A, which have the potential to alter the exposure of VX -445, TEZ, or IVA, will be prohibited. Moderate and strong CYP3A inhibitors (except ciprofloxacin)a None allowed after the first dose of study drug on Day -28 None allowed through completion of study participation Non-Vertex CFTR modulators (investigational or approved) None allowed within 28 days or 5 terminal half - lives (whichever is longer) before screening None allowed through completion of study participation These agents may confound the results of this study. Vertex CFTR modulators (investigational or approved), except for study drugs None allowed from the first dose of study drug on Day -28 None allowed until after the last dose of study drug These agents may confound the results of this study. IVA: ivacaftor; TEZ: tezacaftor a Ciprofloxacin is not a moderate CYP3A inhibitor on the basis of results of a drug -drug interaction study conducted with IVA, a sensitive CYP3A substrate (Kalydeco [ivacaftor] US Package Insert). 9.5 Prior and Concomitant Medications Information regarding prior and concomitant medications, including CF medications, other medications, and herbal and naturopathic remedies, will be collected from each subject’s source documentation for medications taken within 56 days before the Screening Visit through completion of study participation, as defined in Se ction 9.1.7. Medications will be categorized as de fined in Section 12.3.2.3 . F or subjects who are screened but are not subsequently randomized, details of prior medication will be documented only in the subjects’ source documents.  S ubjects should remain on a stable treatment regimen for their CF from 28 days before the Day -28 Visit through completi on of study participation. Stable treatment regimen is defined as the current treatment regimen for CF that subjects have been following for at least 28 days before the Day -28 Visit. Subjects who are on Vertex CFTR modulators (investigational or approved) at the date of informed cons ent may remain on these during the Screening Period and should transition directly to study drug at the beginning of the Run-in Period on Day -28 without a washout ( Table 9-3). Subjects s hould not initiate long-term treatment with new medication from 28 days before th e Day -28 Visit through completion of study participation. Guidelines for stable treatment regimens for CF are as follows: Page 44 of 561"
31,page_31,"Protocol VX18- 445-104, Version 2.0 P age 32 of 69 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information o S ubjects who are taking inhaled tobramycin or other chronically inhaled antibiotics should remain on that regimen throughout the study. o Subjects who cycle onto and off of an inhaled antibiotic should continue on their prior schedule. The timing of the first dose of study drug on the Day 1 Visit should be synchronized as close ly as possible (e.g., not more than ± 3 days) to the first day in th e cycle onto the inhaled anti biotic. o S ubjects who alternate between 2 different inhaled antibiotics should remain on the same cycling schedule during the study. The timing of the first dose of study drug on the Day 1 Visit should be synchroniz ed as closely as possible (e.g., not more than ± 3 days) to the first day in the cy cle onto 1 of the inhaled antibiotics.  S ubjects may receive doses of prednisone or prednisolone of up to 10 mg/day chronically, or up to 60 mg daily for up to 5 days.  VX -445 may inhibit OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, which may increase the exposure of medicinal products that are substrates for these transporters. Substrates such as statins, glyburide, nateglinide, and repaglinide should be used with caution.  I VA is a weak inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Administration of IVA may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. Digoxin or other substrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index, such as cyclosporine, everolimus, sirolimus, and tacrolimus, should be used with caution and appropriate monitoring.  IVA may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore, during coadministration with warfarin, additional monitoring of the international normalized ratio is recommended. Other medicinal products that are CYP2C9 substrates for which exposure may be increased include glimepiride and glipizide; these should be used with caution.  I nformation about bronchodilator use during the study will be collected and documented. Subjects who are using a bronchodilator must have their spirometry assessments performed according to the guidelines provided in Section 11.5.1 . 9 .6 Administration 9.6.1 Dosing Study drug will be administered orally. All subjects will receive the same number of tablets each day during the Treatment Period to maintain the blind. Additional information is provided in the Pharmacy Manual. Study drug should be administered with a fat-containing meal or snack, such as a standard “CF” meal or snack or a standard meal. 1. I t is recommended that the dose be taken within 30 minutes of the start of the meal or snack. 2. In the IVA comparator group, study drug in the Run-in Period will be administered as 1 IVA tablet in the morning and 1 IVA tablet in the evening. Study drug in the Treatment Period will be administered as 2 fixed-dose combination (FDC) TC tablets or matching placebo tablets and 1 IVA tablet or matching placebo tablet in the morning, and 1 IVA tablet in the Page 45 of 561"

In the TEZ/IVA comparator group, study drug in the Run-in Period will be administered as 1 TEZ/IVA FDC tablet in the morning and 1 IVA tablet in the evening. Study drug in the Tr eatment Period will be administered as 2 FDC TC tablets or matching placebo tablets and 1 TEZ/IVA FDC tablet or matching placebo tablet in the morning, and 1 IVA tablet in the e vening ( Table 9-2). For each subject, doses of study drugs should be taken at approximately the sa me time (± 2 hours) each day. 4. The date, amount taken, and time of study drug administration, including whether food was taken with each dose, will be recorded for the 2 doses before PK sample collection and the dose received on the morning of PK sample collecti on (if applicable). 5. On da ys of scheduled visits, the morning dose of study drug will be administered at the site after predose assessments have been completed. A meal or snack will be provided by the site for the morning dose of study drug. 6. I f a subject’s scheduled visit is to occur in the afternoon, the following guidelines should be used:  If the dose in the clinic will be within 6 hours of the subject’s scheduled morning dose, the subject should withhold their morning dose of stud y drug and the morning dose will be administered in the clinic.  I f the dose in the clinic will be more than 6 hours after the subject’s scheduled morning dose, the subject should take the morning dose of stud y drug at home. 7. S ubjects will be instructed to bring all used and unused materials associated with the study drug to the site; study drug will be dispensed at each visit, as appropriate. 9.6.2 Missed Doses If 6 hours or less have passed since the missed morning or evening dose, the subject should take the mis sed dose as soon as possible and continue on the original schedule. Morning dose: If more than 6 hours have passed since the missed morning dose, the subject shoul d take the missed dose as soon as possible and should not take the evening dose. Evening dose: If more than 6 hours have passed since the missed evening dose, the subject shoul d not take the missed dose. The next scheduled morning dose should be taken at the usual time. Morning and evening doses should not be taken at the same time. 9.7 Dose Modification for Toxicity No dose modifications for toxicity are allowed. Treatment may be interrupted as outlined in Section 9.8. If any unacceptable toxicity arises, individual subjects will discontinue dosing (Sec tion 9.1.5 ). 9.8 Study Drug Interruption and Stopping Rules In subjects who have interrupted study drug for >72 hours for any reason, the investigator should resume study drug only after a thorough investigat ion of the cause for interruption. The Page 46 of 561"
33,page_33,"Protocol VX18- 445-104, Version 2.0 P age 34 of 69 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information investigator will evaluate the subject’s clinical stability and should consider resumption of study drug only after the subject is clinically stable and there is no comorbidity or condition that, in the opini on of the investigator, might confound the results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering study drug to the subject. The medical monitor should be notified of an interruption of study drug that lasts >72 hours for any reason and of the resumption of study drug after such interruption. The medical monitor should be notified of any plan to discontinue study drug. 9.8.1 Liver Function Tests The central laboratory will notify the medical monitor of ALT or AST >3 × ULN and total bil irubin >2 × ULN that are derived from centrally submitted samples. S ubjects with new treatment-emergent ALT or AST elevations of >3 × ULN, with or without tot al bilirubin >2 × ULN, must be followed closely, including confirmatory testing performed by the c entral laboratory within 48 to 72 hours of the initial finding and subsequent close moni toring of ALT, AST, and bilirubin levels, as clinically indicated. If a subject cannot return to the site for confirmatory testing, a local laboratory may be used. Local laboratory results must be reported immediately to the medical monitor, and the subject must have the tests repeated and sent to the central laboratory as soon as possible (ideally within 48 to 72 hours). Study drug administration must be interrupted immediately (prior to confirmatory testing) if any of the following criteria are met:  ALT or AST >8 × ULN  A LT or AST >5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks  A LT or AST >3 × ULN, in association with total bilirubin >2 × ULN and/or clinical jaundice A thorough investigation of potential causes should be conducted, and the subject should be followed closely for clinical progression. Study drug administration must be discontinued if the following criterion is met:  Subsequent ALT or AST values confirm the initial elevation that satisfied the interruption rule (above), and no convincing alternative etiology (e.g., acetaminophen use, viral hepatitis, a lcohol ingestion) is identified, regardless of whether transaminase levels have improved All subjects in whom treatment is discontinued for elevated transaminases (and bilirubin, as applicable) should have these levels monitored closely until levels normalize or return to baseline. If an alternative, reversible cause of transaminase elevation with or without increased bilirubin or clinical jaundice has been identified, study drug administration may be resumed once transaminases return to baseline or are ≤2 × ULN, whichever is higher. Regardless of the dura tion of interruption, the medical monitor should be notified prior to resumption of study drug. Upon resumption of study drug, transaminases and bilirubin should be assessed weekly for 4 weeks. If a protocol-defined transaminase elevation interruption threshold recurs within 4 weeks of rechallenge with the study drug (with confirmation of the initial elevation by repeat Page 47 of 561"
34,page_34,"Protocol VX18- 445-104, Version 2.0 P age 35 of 69 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information testing within 48 to 72 hours), then the study drug must be permanently discontinued, regardless of the presumed etiology. 9.8.2 Rash Individua ls who develop a generaliz ed rash will be monitore d closely. Study drug dosing should be interrupted if a subject develops a generalized rash of Grade 3 or higher, or a rash that is considered a serious adverse event (SAE). The investigator will notify the medical monitor of any rash that results in interruption of study drug, is Grade 3 or higher (Section 13.1.1.4 ), or is an SAE. Investigators should consider additional evaluation including laboratory testing (e.g., complete blood count with differential, liver function test), photographs of the rash, and dermatology consultation. The investigator may consider resumption of study drug if clinically appropriate. 9.9 Removal of Subjects Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request. Subjects may be withdrawn from study drug treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator or Vertex for safety, behavior, noncompliance with study procedures, or administrative reasons. A subject who prematurely terminates study drug treatment will continue to be followed, unless the subject withdraws consent (or assent, when applicable). In addition, a subject must be discontinued from study drug treatment if the subject meets either of the following criteria, and should return for study assessments as noted in Section 9.1.5.2:  Mee ts any of the stopping (discontinuation) criteria (Section 9.8)  B ecomes pregnant (Section 11.6.7.2) Othe r criteria that require subjects to be discontinued from study drug treatment are:  I f a subject is identified after randomization as having been enrolled to the incorrect comparator group, the subject must be discontinued from the study. If a subject does not return for a scheduled visit, reasonable effort will be made to contact the subject. In any circumstance, reasonable effort will be made to document subject outcome. The investigator will inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request that the subject return all unused investigational product(s), request that the subject return for an ETT Visit and Safety Follow-up Visit, if applicable (see Section 9.1.5), and follow up with the subject regarding any unre solved AEs. If a subject withdraws consent or assent for the stud y, no further assessments will be performed. Vertex may retain and continue using the study data and samples after the study ends, and may use the samples and information in the development of the study compounds, for other drugs and diagnostics, in publications and presentations, and for education purposes. If a subject withdraws from the study, the study data and samples collected will remain part of the study. A subject will not be able to request the withdrawal of his or her information from the study data. A subject may request destruction of the samples collected from him or her during the study as long as those samples can be identified as his or her samples. 9.10 Replacement of Subjects Subjects who withdraw or are withdrawn before the first dose of study drug on Day 1 of the Treatment Period may be replaced.

Subjects will be instructed to return all used and unused material s associated with the study drug to the site. These materials will be retained at the site according to instructions provided by Vertex or its designee. The study monitor will review study drug records and inventory throughout the study. If a site uses a s ite-specific drug accountability system and/or process, including processes associated with the destruction of returned materials, the process must be documented and approved by Vertex. The study monitor must review the drug accountability documentation on a re gular basis. The study monitor will promptly communicate to Vertex any discrepancies he or she is unable to resolve with the site. 10.5 Disposal, Return, or Retention of Unused Drug The study site staff or pharmacy personnel will retain all materials returned by the subjects until the study monitor has performed drug accountability. The investigator will ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special instructions provided by Vertex. Destruction will be adequately documented. 10.6 Compliance To ensure treatment compliance, the investigator or designee will supervise all study drug dosing that occurs at the site. At each visit, site personnel will review that the subject is compliant with study drug dosing and remind the subject of study drug dosing requirements. Compliance will also be assessed by ongoing study drug count. If a subject demonstrates continued noncompliance of study drug dosing despite educational efforts, the investigator should consider discontinuing the subject from the study. 10.7 Blinding and Unblinding This will be a double-blind study. 10.7.1 Blinding All su bjects (and their parents/caregivers/companions), site personnel (including the investigator, the site monitor, and the study team), and members of the Vertex study team will be blinded to the treatment codes. Individuals who may be unblinded include only the following:  An y site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject in the event of a life-threatening medical emergency Page 50 of 561"
37,page_37,"Protocol VX18- 445-104, Version 2.0 P age 38 of 69 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information  An y site personnel for whom this information is important to ensure the safety of the subject and her fetus in the event of a pregnancy  Ve rtex Global Patient Safety (GPS) and Regulatory Affairs personnel to satisfy SAE processing and reporting regulations  Vendor preparing the final (production) randomization list  Ve rtex IWRS Manager  Ve rtex Clinical Supply Chain  I DMC  Ve ndor preparing the unblinded analysis of data for safety review by the IDMC  B ioanalytical contract research organization (CRO) analyzing PK samples and the Vertex bioanalytical personnel who is not a member of the study team but reviews raw data from the bioana lytical CRO. The Vertex bioanalytical study team member will continue to be blinded. Access to Spirometry and SwCl Results: During the conduct of the study, the Vertex study team will not have access to the spirometry or SwCl results after the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period. Shortly before any planned efficacy analysis is conducted, the spirometry and SwCl data will be reviewed for data cleaning purposes by a biostatistician who does not have access to the treatment codes. Individual SwCl test results will not be disclosed to the study sites with the exception of the screening and Day -14 Visit values. Subjects and their parents/caregivers/companions should not be informed of study-related spirometry results until Vertex has determined that the study has completed (i.e., clinical study report [CSR] finalization), regardless of whether the subject has pr ematurely discontinued treatment. 10.7.2 Unblinding At the initiation of the study, study site personnel will be instructed on the method for breaking the blind. The unblinding method will be either manual or electronic. Unblinding of Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Investigator for Medical Emergencies or Urgent Clinical Situations Unblinding of the individual subject’s treatment by the investigator will be limited to medical emergencies or urgent clinical situations in which knowledge of the subject’s study treatment is necessary for clinical management. In such cases, investigators will use their best judgment as to whether to unblind without first attempting to contact the medical monitor to discuss unblinding. If investigators deem it unnecessary to unblind immediately, they will first attempt to contact the medical monitor to discuss unblinding. If investigators have tried but are unable to reach the medical monitor, they will use their best judgment, based on the nature and urgency of the clinical situation, and may proceed with unblinding. Contact information for the medical monitor (or appropriate backup) will be in a separate document. Page 51 of 561"
38,page_38,"Protocol VX18- 445-104, Version 2.0 P age 39 of 69 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information If a subject’s treatment assignment has been unblinded for a medical emergency or urgent clinical situation, the medical monitor will be notified within 24 hours of the unblinding event. The reason and the date of the unblinding will be documented clearly in the subject’s study file. Information about the treatment assignment obtained from the unblinding will be maintained in a secure location with controlled access and will not be shared with Vertex, the CRO, or any site personnel (other than the physician treating the subject). In addition, the investigator will consider whether the clinical event that prompted unblinding will be considered an SAE, according to the regulatory definitions or criteria for SAEs, and if so, submit an SAE report to Vertex GPS or designee, per Section 13.1.2. Unb linding of Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Vertex GPS or Designee for SAEs or Safety Concerns Vertex GPS or designee will also unblind any SAE reports in compliance with regulatory reporting requirements. In addition, Vertex may, for matters relating to safety, unblind individual subjects at any time. 11 ASSESSMENTS The schedule of assessments is shown in Table 3-1 and Table 3-2. 1 1.1 Subject and Disease Characteristics Subject and disease characteristics include the following: demographics, medical history, height, and weight. Medical history will be elicited from each subject and extracted from medical records during screening. Based on the medical history, the subject will be assessed for any disqualifying medical conditions as specified in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The medical history will include a complete review of systems, medical and surgical histories, and any allergies. Height and weight will be measured with shoes off . Following screening, height will be collected onl y for subjects ≤21 years of age on the date of informed consent. 11.2 Pharmacokinetics 11.2.1 Blood Sampling Blood samples will be collected to determine plasma concentrations of VX-445, TEZ, M1 -TEZ, and IVA. These samples may also be use d to evaluate metabolites of VX-445 and IVA or additional metabolites of TEZ for further evaluation of the bioanalytical method, or for exploratory analyses that provide information on the metabolic pathways used by or affected by VX-445. The Day 1, Day 15, and Week 4 predose PK samples should be collected within 60 minutes before dosing. The Week 8 predose PK sample should be collected within 60 minutes before dosing for subjects who are receivi ng their first dose of study drug in an open-label study on the same day as the Week 8 Visit. For subjects who are not entering an open-label study within 24 hours of the Week 8 Visit, the Week 8 sample should be collected approximately 12 hours a fter the evening dose of IVA be fore the Week 8 Visit. All efforts should be made to obtain the PK sample s during this specified window. Samples collected outside of the window will be considered protocol deviations. Page 52 of 561"

The collection date and exact time that each PK blood sample is drawn will also be recorded. Samples from the PK sampling will be kept frozen by Vertex or its designee until all analyses have been completed and then disposed of according to Vertex or designee standard operating procedures. 11.2.2 Processing and Handling of Pharmacokinetic Samples Detailed procedures for the collection of blood samples and further procedures for processing and handling of samples for PK analysis will be provided in the PK Sample Handling Guidelines. 11.2.3 Bioanalysis Samples will be analyzed using validated analytical methods in compliance with Vertex or designee standard operating procedures. A description of the assays and validation data will be provided in separate reports. 11.3 Pharmacodynamics: Sweat Chloride SwCl samples will be collected with an approved collection device. Each collection will occur before study drug dosing (Section 9.6.1). At each time point, 2 samples will be collected, 1 from e ach arm (left and right). Sweat sampl es will be sent to a central laboratory for testing and interpretation of results. Specific instructions for the collection, handling, processing, and shipping of SwCl samples to the central laboratory will be provided separately. See Section 10.7.1 for information about access to SwCl results. 11.4 Exploratory Asse ssments These data will be used for exploratory purposes. Detailed procedures for the collection, processing, storage, and shipment of samples for exploratory assessments will be provided in a separate document. 11.4.1 Pharmacogenomics An optional single blood sample (DNA sample) will be collected for potential exploratory evaluation of correlations between DNA markers with PK, PD, treatment response, AEs, and biomarkers related to health and disease, including CF, f or subjects who choose to participate in this assessment. 11.4.2 Inflammatory Mediators Blood samples (inflammatory mediator samples) will be collected at the time points noted in Table 3-2 and tested to assess markers related to inflammation. These markers may include, but are not limited to, C-reactive protein, imm unoglobulin G, white blood cell (leukocyte) count, and interleukin-8. 11.4.3 Other Blood Biomarkers Serum from an inflammatory mediator sample and an additional blood sample for plasma will be c ollected and banked for potential future exploratory evaluation of other blood biomarkers (e.g., proteins, peptides, lipids, metabolites, etc.) in relation to PK, PD, treatment response, AEs, and various disease manifestations of CF.

This will establish a baseline for subjects who continue into an open-label study and allow for evaluation of microbiology analysis and sputum biomarkers (which may include, but are not limited to, qualitative and quantitative bacterial and viral assessments including genomic analyses, analysis of immune cells, inflammatory markers, proteins, peptides, lipids, and endogenous metabolites) in relation to PK, PD, treatment response, AEs, and various disease manifestations of CF. 11.5 Efficacy 11.5.1 Spirometry S pirometry will be performed according to the American Thoracic Society Guidelines/European Respiratory Society Guidelines12 and according to the additional guidelines that follow. P re-bronchodilator spirometry is defined as spirometry testing performed for subjects who have  withheld their short-acting bronchodilators (e.g., albuterol) or anticholinergic (e.g., ipratropium bromide [Atrovent®]) for more than 4 hours before the spirometry assessment;  withheld their long -acting bronchodilator (e.g., salmeterol) for more than 12 hours before the spirometry assessment; and  withheld their once-daily, long-acting bronchodilator (e.g., tiotropium bromide [Spiriva®]) for more than 24 hours before the spirometry assessment. During the Screening Period, spirometry assessm ents may be performed pre- or post-bronchodilator. At all other visits, all spirometry assessm ents should be performed pre-bronchodilator. During the Treatment Period, spirometry assessments must be performed before study drug dosing (Section 9.6.1) at approximately the same time at each visit. In the e vent that a subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator(s), spirometry should be performed according to the following:  I f a subject’s Day 1 spirometry assessment is pre-bronchodilator, but, on a subsequent visit, the subject forgets to withhold bronchodilator use, a post-bronchodilator spirometry assessment will be obtained for that visit only, and the visit will not be rescheduled.  I f, on Day 1, the subject forgets to withhold his or her dose of bronchodilator, spirometry should be performed post-bronchodilator, and all subsequent spirome tric measurements (according to the schedule of assessments in Table 3-2) should be performed post-bronchodilator.  Each spirometry assessment will be recorded in the source documents as pre- or post-bronchodilator. All sites will be provided with spirometers to be use d for all study assessments. Spirometry data will be transmitted to a centralized spirometry service for quality review.

Subjects will be asked to complete the CFQ-R in their native language, if validated translations are available.16, 17 If there is no validated translation available in the subject’s native language, the subjec t will not complete the questionnaire. Copies of the CFQ-R used will be provided in the Study Reference Manual. Validated translations of the CFQ-R, if available, will be provided for participating centers in non-English-speaking countries.18, 19 The CFQ-R will be completed before any other assessments are performed at that visit. Subjects who are 12 and 13 years of age at the date of informed consent will complete the CFQ-R Child version themselves, and their parents/caregivers will complete the CFQ-R P arent version, at all visits, regardless of whether the subject subsequently turns 14 years of age during the study. Subjects 14 years of age or older at the date of informed consent will complete the Adolescent/Adult version of the questionnaire themselves at all visits. 11.6 Safety Safety evaluations will include AEs, clinical laboratory assessments, physical examinations, and clinical evaluation of vital signs, ECGs and pulse oximetry. For subjects <18 years of age on the date of informed consent, OEs will also be performed at screening (if not done within the preceding 3 months). 11.6.1 Adverse Even ts All AEs will be assessed, documented, and reported in ac cordance with ICH GCP Guidelines. Section 13.1 outlines the definitions, collection periods, criteria, and procedure s for documenting, grading, and reporting AEs. A separate document that details AE CRF c ompletion guidelines for investigators as well as training will be provided. 11.6.2 Clinical Laboratory Assessments Blood and urine samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory, with the exception of the urine pregnancy tests.

Pregnancy (β-human Chorionic Gonadotropin) Tests for Female Subjects: All female subjects, regardless of childbearing potential status, must have a serum pregnancy test at screening. Serum pregnancy tests will be performed at the study site and analyzed at the central laboratory. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed and analyzed at the site. The urine pregnancy test on Day -28 and Day 1 must be negative before the first dose of study drug in each study period. Additional pregnancy tests may be required according to local regulations and/or requirements. FSH (Screening Period Only): Blood samples for FSH will be measured for any suspected postmenopausal female with at least 12 months of continuous spontaneous amenorrhea. Serum FSH levels must be in the p ostmenopausal range as determined by the laboratory performing the test. CFTR Genotype (Screening Period Only): CFTR genotyping will be performed for all subjects. A subject’s screening CFTR genotype must confirm eligibility before the subject enters the Run-in Period. In subjects with an R117H mutation, linkage to poly-T tract polymorphisms will a lso be determined from a second specimen. Specific instructions will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.

43,page_43,"Protocol VX18- 445-104, Version 2.0 P age 44 of 69 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information Additional Evaluations: Additional clinical laboratory evaluations will be performed at other times if judged to be clinically appropriate. For the purposes of study conduct and unless noted otherwise, only laboratory tests done in the central laboratory may be used. Local laboratories may be used at the discretion of the local investigator for management of urgent medical issues. If a local laboratory test value is found to be abnormal and clinically significant, it will be verified by the central laboratory as soon as possible after the investigator becomes aware of the abnormal result. If it is not possible to send a timely specimen to the central laboratory (e.g., the subject was hospitalized elsewhere), the investigator may base the assessment of an AE on the local laboratory value. 11.6.3 Physical Examinations and Vital Signs A physical examination of all body systems and vital signs assessment will be performed at screening and select study visits (see Table 3-1 a nd Table 3-2). At other visits, symptom-directed physical examina tions and symptom-directed vital signs assessments can be performed at the discretion of the investigator or healthcare provider. A complete physical examination includes a review of the following systems: head, neck, and thyroid; eyes, ears, nose, and throat (EENT); respiratory; cardiovascular; lymph nodes; abdomen; skin; musculoskeletal; and neurological. Breast, anorectal, and genital examinations will be performed when medically indi cated. After screening, any clinically significant abnormal findings in physical examinations will be reported as AEs. The abbreviated physical examination will include an assessment of the following body systems: EENT, cardiovascular system, respirator y system, skin, and abdomen. Vital signs include blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), temperature, pulse rate, and respiratory rate. The subject will be instructed to rest for at least 5 minutes before vital signs are assessed. 11.6.4 Pulse Oximetry Pulse oximetry is a noninvasive measure of oxygen delivery to the tissues and has been correlated with clinical status and lung function. Arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry will be assessed following at least a 5-minute rest and before study drug dosing. 11.6.5 Electrocardiograms Standard 12-lead ECGs will be performed using a machine with printout. Additional standard 12-lead ECGs may be performed at any other time if clinically indicated. The performance of all ECGs wil l adhere to the following guidelines:  The subject will be instructed to rest for at least 5 minutes before having an ECG.  The test should be performed in the supine position. A printout of the ECG traces will be made for safety review by the investigator and maintained with source documentation. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities occurring during the study through completion of study participation will be recorded as AEs. To ensure the safety of the subjects, a qualified individual at the study site will make comparisons to baseline measurements. I f the QTcF is increased by >60 msec from the baseline or an absolute QTcF value is ≥500 msec for any scheduled ECG, 2 additional ECGs will be Page 57 of 561"
44,page_44,"Protocol VX18- 445-104, Version 2.0 P age 45 of 69 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information performed approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart to confirm the original measurement. If either of the Q TcF values from these repeated ECGs remains above the threshold value (>60 msec from ba seline or ≥500 msec), a single ECG will be repeated at least hourly until QTcF values from 2 successive ECGs fall below the threshold value that triggered the repeat measurement. Further de tails pertaining to ECGs will be provided to sites in the ECG Manual. 11.6.6 Ophthalmologic Examination OEs will be conducted at screening only for subjects who are <18 years of age on the date of infor med consent. OEs do not need to be completed if there is documentation of bilateral lens removal for the subject. All examinations will be conducted by a licensed ophthalmologist or optometrist and will include  mea surement of best-corrected distance visual acuity of each eye; and  pha rmacologically dilated examination of the lens with a slit lamp. The screening examination does not need to be conducted if there is documentation of an examination meeting the protocol requirements that was conducted within 3 months before the date of informed consent. For subjects <18 years of age on the date of informed consent, an OE is required at the Safety Follow-up Visit only if they completed study drug dosing through Week 8 of the Treatment P eriod. This examination may be completed up to 28 days before the Safety Follow-up Visit, after the last dose of study drug in the Treatment Period. Any clinically significant abnormal findings will be reported as AEs. For subjects who subsequently enroll in an open-label study, follow-up OEs will be performed as per that study’s protocol. 11.6.7 Contraception and Pregnancy The effects of VX-445, TEZ, and IVA on conception, pregnancy, and lactation in humans are not known. VX-445, TEZ, and IVA did not show genotoxic potential in a standard battery of in vitro (Ames test, chromosomal aberration, or micronucleus in cultured mammalian cells) and in vivo (rodent micronucleus) studies. Reproductive toxicology studies of VX-445, TEZ, and IVA have not shown terato genicity in rats and rabbits. 11.6.7.1 Contraception Contraception requirement for a couple is waived for the following:  Tr ue abstinence for the subject, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. True abstinence must be practiced from the date of informed consent through 90 days after the last dose of study dr ug.  I f the male is infertile (e.g., bilateral orchiectomy). If a male subject is assumed to have complete bilateral absence of the vas deferens, infertility must be documented before the first dose of study drug (e.g., examination of a semen specimen or by demonstration of the absence of the vas deferens by ultrasound).

I f a female subject becomes pregnant during study participation, study drug will be permanently discontinued immediately. The investigator will notify the medical monitor and Vertex GPS within 24 hours of the site’s knowledge of the subject’s (or partner’s) pregnancy using the P regnancy Information Collection Form. Male subjects with female partners who become pr egnant during the study must use a male condom to avoid exposure of a potential embryo or fetus to study drug via the seminal fluid. The subject or partner will be followed until the end of the pregnancy and the infant will be followed for 1 year after the birth, provided informed consent is obtained. A separate ICF will be provided to explain these follow-up activities. Pregnancy itself does not constitute an AE. 12 STATISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLANS 12.1 Sample Size and Power Approximately 250 subjects will be enrolled and randomized (1:1) to the VX-445/TEZ/IVA treatment arm or control arm (IVA or TEZ/IVA). The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through Week 8 for the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group. The primary null hypothesis to be tested is that the mean a bsolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through Week 8 is 0 for the VX-445 /TEZ/IVA treatment group. The null hypothesis will be tested at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. For the primary hypothesis, assuming a within-group SD of 7.0 percentage points and a 10% dr opout rate at Week 8, a sample size of 125 subjects in the VX-445/TEZ/IVA arm will have > 99% power to detect the within-group difference of 3.0 percentage points (1 sample t- test at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05). 12.2 Analysis Sets The following analysis sets are defined: All Subjects Set, Full Analysis Set (FAS), and Safety Set. Additional analysis sets related to the Run-in Period will be defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), as appropriate. The All Subjects Set will include all subjects who were randomized or received at least 1 dose of study drug. This analysis set will be used for all individual subject data listings and disposition summary tables, unless otherwise specified. Page 60 of 561"
47,page_47,"Protocol VX18- 445-104, Version 2.0 P age 48 of 69 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information The FAS will include all randomized subjects who carry the intended C FTR allele mutation and ha ve received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Treatment Period. The FAS will be used to summ arize subject demog raphics and baseline characteristics, and for all efficacy analyses in which subjects will be analyzed according to their randomized treatment group, unless otherwise specified. The Safety Set will include all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug in the Treatment Period. Th e Safety Set will be used for all safety analyses in which subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment they received, unless otherwise specified. 12.3 Statistical Analysis 12.3.1 General Considerations Continuous variables will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: the number of subjects (n), mean, SD, median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max). The precision of the measurement for each continuous variable will be specified in the SAP. Unless otherwise specified, min and max values will be reported with the same precision as the units of the raw data. The mean, median, and SD will be reported to 1 additional decimal place. Any values that require a transformation to standard units (metric or SI) will be converted with the appropriate precision. Categorical variables will be summarized using counts and percentages. Percentages will be pr esented to 1 decimal place. The baseline value , unless other wise specified, will be defined as the most recent non-missing measurement (scheduled or unscheduled) collected before the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period (i.e., the Day 1 Visit). For ECGs, baseline will be defined as the most recent pretreatment measurement (or the average of triplicate measurements, if the most recent pretreatment measurement is obtained in triplicate) before the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period (i.e., the Day 1 Visit). Absolute change from baseline will be calculated as post-baseline value – baseline value. The Treatment-emergent (TE) Period for the Run-in Period will be from the first dose date of study drug in the Run-in Period to (1) the first dose date of study drug in the Treatment Period for subjects who complete the Run-in Period and continue to the Treatment Period, or (2) 28 days after the last dose date of study drug in the Run-in Period or to the completion of study pa rticipation date, whichever occurs first, for subjects who do not continue to the Treatment Period (e.g., subjects who do not meet the conditions to enter the Treatment Period). The TE Period for the Treatment Period will include the time from the first dose of study drug in t he Treatment Period (TC, placebo + TEZ/IVA, or placebo + IVA) to 28 days after the last dose of study drug or to the completion of study participation date (as defined in Section 9.1.7), whic hever occurs first. 12.3.2 Background Characteristics 12.3.2.1 Subject Disposition The number and percentage of subjects in each disposition category (e.g., randomized, included in the FAS, included in the Safety Set, completed Treatment Period, completed study, prematurely discontinued treatment or study with a breakdown of the reasons for Page 61 of 561"

An additional subject disposition summary related to the Run-in Period will be defined in the SAP, as appropriate. 12.3.2.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Demographic, medical history, and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive summary statistics. The following demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized overall and by treatment group based on the FAS, and will include (but are not limited to): sex, race, ethnicity, baseline age, baseline weight, baseline height, baseline BMI, baseline ppFEV 1, and baseline SwCl. Medical history will be summarized by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) for the FAS. No statistical tests will be performed to evaluate baseline imbalance between treatment groups. 12.3.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Medications Medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug-Dictionary (WHO-DD) and categorized as follows:  P rior medication : any medication that was administered during the 56 days before the first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period but not in the Run-in Period. For subjects who discontinue during the Run-in Period and whose first dose of study drug in the Treatment Period therefore does not occur, prior medication will be considered any medication that was administered during the 56 days before the last dose of study drug in the Run-in Period but be fore the first dose in the Run-in Period.  Conco mitant medication during the Run-in Period : medication continued or newly received during the TE Period for the Run-in Period.  Concomitant medication during the Treatment Period : medication continued or newly received during the TE Period for the Treatment Period.  Post-treatment medication : medication continued or newly received after: o the T E Period for the Run-in Period if the subject did not receive study drug in the Treatment Period o the T E Period for the Treatment Period for subjects who received study drug in the Treatment Period A given medication may be classified as a prior medication, a concomitant medication, or a post-treatment medication; both prior and concomitant; both concomitant and post-treatment; or prior, concomitant, and post-treatment. If a medication has a missing or partially missing start/end date or time and if it cannot be determined whether it was taken before the first dose of study drug, concomitantly during the TE Period, or after the TE Period, it will be considered in all 3 categories of prior, concomitant, and post-treatment medication.

Post-treatment medications will be pr ovided separately in an individual subject data listing. 12.3.2.4 Study Drug Exposure and Compliance Study drug exposure and compliance will be summarized for the Treatment Period only. Study drug exposure will be summarized overall and by treatment group based on the Safety Set in terms of the duration of treatment a subject received (in days), defined as [(the last day of study drug administration – the first day of study drug administration) + 1 day], regardless of stud y drug interruption. Study drug compliance will be summarized overall and by treatment group based on the FAS, and will be derived as: 100 × [1 - (total number of days of study drug interruption) / (duration of stu dy drug exposure in days)]. A study drug interruption on a given day is defined as an interruption of any study drug on that day. In addition, percentage of tablets taken will also be summarized overall and by treatment group based on the FAS, and will be calculated as 100 × [(total number of tablets dispensed for the Tr eatment Period) – (total number of tablets returned for the Treatment Period)] / (total number of tablets planned to be taken per day × duration of study drug exposure in days for the Tr eatment Period). 12.3.2.5 Important Protocol Deviations An important protocol deviation (IPD) is a deviation that may significantly affect the completeness, accuracy, or reliability of the study data or that may significantly affect a subject’s rights, safety, or well-being. The rules for identifying an IPD will be described in the SAP. All IPDs will be provided in an individual subject data listing and summarized, as appropriate. 12.3.3 Efficacy and Pharmacodynamic Analyses The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of the efficacy of VX-445/TEZ/IVA. The analysis in this section will be based on the FAS, unless otherwise specified. 12.3.3.1 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint is the absolute change in ppFEV 1 from baseline through Week 8 for the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group. The primary endpoint will be analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM).The model will include the absolute change from baseline in ppFEV 1 at Day 15, Week 4, and Week 8 as the dependent variable; treatment group, visi t, and treatment by visit as fixed effects; with continuous baseline ppFEV 1, continuous baseline SwCl, and comparator group (IVA comparator versus TEZ/IVA comparator) as covariates; and an unstructured covariance structure for the within-subject errors. The Day 15 Visit will not be included in the estimation of the average treatment effect through Week 8. The model will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. Denominator degrees of freedom for the F test for fixed effects will be estimated using the Kenward-Roger approximation. An unst ructured covariance structure will be used to model the within-subject errors. If the model estimation does not converge, a reduced compound symmetry covariance structure will be used instead. Conditional on the observed data and covariates, missing data due to treatment or study Page 63 of 561"
50,page_50,"Protocol VX18- 445-104, Version 2.0 P age 51 of 69 Ver tex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information discontinuation will be assumed to be missing at random; consequently, no imputation of missing data will be performed. The primary results obtained from the model will be the estimated within-treatment difference through Week 8 (average of Week 4 and Week 8) for the VX-445/TEZ/IVA group. The adjusted mean with a 2-sided 95% CI and a 2-sided P value will be provided. Furthermore, the treatment diff erence at each post-baseline visit will also be provided, obtained from the model.

This includes any newly occurring event or worsening of a pre-existing condition (e.g., increase in its severity or frequency) after the I CF is signed. An AE is considered serious if it meets the definition in Section 13.1.2.1. 13.1.1.2 Clinic ally Significant Assessments Study assessments including laboratory tests, ECGs, physical examinations, and vital signs will be assessed and those deemed to have clinically significant worsening from baseline will be documented as an AE. When possible, a clinical diagnosis for the study assessment will be Page 68 of 561"

In the absence of a diagnosis, the abnormal study assessment itself will be listed as the AE (e.g., bacteria in urine or decreased hemoglobin). An abnormal study assessment is considered clinically significant if the subject has 1 or more of the following:  C oncomitant signs or symptoms related to the abnormal study assessment  F urther diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention  A c hange in the dose of study drug or discontinuation from the study Repeat testing to determine whether the result is abnormal, in the absence of any of the above criteria, does not necessarily meet clinically significant criteria. The determination of whether the study assessment results are clinically significant will be made by the investigator. A laboratory value that is Grade 4 will not automatically be an SAE. A Grade 4 laboratory value will be an SAE if the subject’s clinical st atus indicates a life-threatening AE. 13.1.1.3 Documentation of Adverse Events All AEs will be collected from the time the ICF is signed until the subject completes study participation, as defined in Section 9.1.7. All su bjects will be queried, using nonleading questions, about the occurrence of AEs at each study visit. When possible, a constellation of signs and/or symptoms will be identified as 1 overall event or diagnosis. All AEs for enrolled subjects will be recorded in the CRF and sourc e document. AEs for subjects who are screened but not subsequently enrolled will be recorded only in the subject’s source documents. The following data will be documented for each AE:  De scription of the event  C lassification of “serious” or “nonserious”  Da te of first occurrence and date of resolution (if applicable)  S everity  C ausal relationship to study drug(s)  Action taken  Outcome  Concomitant medication or other treatment given 13.1.1.4 Adverse Event Severity The investigator will determine and record the severity of all serious and nonserious AEs. The guidance available at the following website will be consulted: Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 5.0, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, http://ctep.cancer.gov/pr otocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm (Accessed July 2018). AEs of CTCAE Grades 4 and 5 will be documented as “life-threatening.” Whe n considering the severity of an AE in a pediatric subject, the investigator will consider that reference ranges for pediatric clinical laboratory parameters may differ from those in the Page 69 of 561"

The severity of an AE described by a term that does not appear in the CTCAE will be determined according to the definitions in Table 13-1. Table 13-1 Grading of AE Severity Classification Definition Mild (Grade 1) Mild level of discomfort and does not interfere with regular activities Moderate (Grade 2) Moderate level of discomfort and significantly interferes with regular activities Severe (Grade 3) Significant level of discomfort and prevents regular activities Life-threatening (Grade 4) Any adverse drug event that places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death AE: adverse event 13.1.1.5 Adverse Event Causality Every effort will be made by the investigator to assess the relationship of the AE, if any, to the study drug(s). Causality will be classified using the categories in Table 13-2. Table 13-2 Classifications for AE Causality Classification Definition Related There is an association between the event and the administration of investigational study drug, a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to the investigational study drug and causes other than the investigational study drug have been ruled out, and/or the event reappeared on re -exposure to the investigational stud y drug. Possibly related There is an association between the event and the administration of the investigational study drug and there is a plausible mechanism for the event to be related to investigational study drug, but there may also be alternative eti ology, such as characteristics of the subject’s clinical status or underlying disease. Unlikely related The event is unlikely to be related to the investigational study drug and likely to be related to factors other than investigational study drug. Not related The event is related to an etiology other than the investigational study drug (the alternative etiology will be documented in the subject’s medical record). AE: adverse event 13.1.1.6 Study Drug Action Taken The investigator will classify the study drug action taken with regard to the AE. The action taken will be classified according to the categories in Table 13-3. Table 13-3 Classifications for Study Drug Action Taken With Regard to an AE Classification Definition Dose not changed Study drug dose not changed in response to an AE Dose reduced Study drug dose reduced in response to an AE Drug interrupted Study drug administration interrupted in response to an AE Drug withdrawn Study drug administration permanently discontinued in response to an AE Not applicable Action taken regarding study drug administration does not apply. “Not applicable” will be used in circumstances such as when the investigational treatment had been completed before the AE began and no opportunity to decide whether to continue, interrupt, or withdraw treatment is possible.

Table 13-4 Classifications for Outcome of an AE Classification Definition Recovered/resolved Resolution of an AE with no residual signs or symptoms Recovered/resolved with sequelae Resolution of an AE with residual signs or symptoms Not recovered/not resolved (continuing) Either incomplete improvement or no improvement of an AE, such that it remains ongoing Fatal Outcome of an AE is death. “Fatal” will be used when death is at leas t possibly related to the AE. Unknown Outcome of an AE is not known (e.g., a subject lost to followup) AE: adverse event 13.1.1.8 Treatment Given The investigator ensures adequate medical care is provided to subjects for any AEs, including clinically significant laboratory values related to study drug. In addition, the investigator will describe whether any treatment was given for the AE. “Yes” is used if any treatment was given in response to an AE, and may include treatments such as other medications, surgery, or physical therapy. “No” indicates the absence of any kind of treatment for an AE. 13.1.2 Serious Adverse Events 13.1.2.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any AE that meets any of the following outcomes:  F atal (death, regardless of cause, that occurs during participation in the study or occurs after participation and is suspected of being a delayed toxicity due to administration of the study drug)  L ife-threatening, such that the subject was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred  Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization  Persistent or significant disability/incapacity (disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  C ongenital anomaly or birth defect  Important medical event that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed Page 71 of 561"

In addition, hospitalizations clearly not associated with an AE (e.g., social hospitalization for purposes of respite care) will not be considered to indicat e an SAE. Clarification will be made between the terms “serious” and “severe” because they are not synonymous. The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific e vent, as in mild, moderate, or severe myocardial infarction. The event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance, such as a severe headache. This is not the same as “serious”, which is based on subject/event outcome or action described above, and is usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or functioning. Seriousness, not severity, serves as a guide for defining expedited regulatory reporting obligations. 13.1.2.2 Reporting a nd Documentation of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through completion of study participation, regardless of causality, will be reported by the investigator to Vertex GPS within 24 hours of identification . In addition, all SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow-up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s) will be reported to Vertex GPS within 24 hours of identification . For SAEs that occur after obtaining informed consent and assent (where applicable) through completion of study participation, the SAE Form will be completed for new/initial events as well as to report follow-up information on previously reported events. Investigators are asked to report follow-up information as soon as it becomes available to ensure timely reporting to health authorities. Please send completed SAE Forms to Vertex GPS via: Email: (preferred choice) Fax: For technica l issues related to submitting the form, contact telephone: SAEs that occur after the Safety Follow-up Visit and are considered related to study drug(s) will be recorded on the Vertex Clinical Trial Safety Information Collection Form (hereafter referred to as the “SAE Form”) using a recognized medical term or diagnosis that accurately reflects the event. SAEs will be assessed by the investigator for relationship to the investigational study drug(s) and possible etiologies. On the SAE Form, relationship to study drug(s) will be assessed only as related (includes possibly related) or not related (includes unlikely related), and severity assessment will not be required. For the purposes of study analysis, if the event has not resolved at the end of the study reporting period, it will be documented as ongoing. For purposes of regulatory safety monitoring, the investigator is required to follow the event to resolution and report the outcome to Vertex using the SAE Form. Page 72 of 561"

70,page_70,"Clinical Study Protocol Addendum for Cystic Fibrosis, Addendum Version 2.0 Page 2 of 7 Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Confidential Information Summary of Changes to Cystic Fibrosis Clinical Study Protocols Vertex is currently evaluating several CFTR modulators in clinical studies for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF), a serious and life -threatening disease. In completed studies, treatment with these CFTR modulators has generally resulted in rapid, robust, clinically meaningful, and statistically significant im provements in clinical measures, and are generally safe and well tolerated. A dverse events (AEs) seen with these treatments are mostly consistent with common manifestations of CF disease or with common illnesses in CF subjects. During this COVID -19 pandem ic, the safety of the subjects, investigators, and site personnel participating in these clinical studies is Vertex’s first priority, thus it is important to minimize any unnecessary risk to COVID -19 exposure through travel to study sites. This addendum summarizes the measures taken for ongoing CF clinical studies. These operational adjustments were implemented to align with Health Authority guidance ensuring the protection of subjects, investigators, and site personnel while maintaining compliance with GCP and minimizing impact to the integrity of the studies. Overall, the benefit -risk of these studies remains favorable. Vertex recommends that subjects and sites refer to local guidance regarding travel restrictions. There are no operational changes to the s tudy protocols for subjects who can travel to the study sites for their visits. However, to ensure continued safety of subjects who cannot travel to the study sites for their visits (for any reason due to COVID -19), specific alternative measures are being implemented to minimize the risk of exposure to COVID -19 (see table below). As the COVID -19 pandemic evolves, Vertex will continue to assess the need for additional actions to ensure the safety of all involved in these clinical studies. Addendum Version 2. 0 summarizes additional measures taken for these ongoing CF clinical studies (see table below) to ensure continued safety . In addition, administrative changes were made to provide clarifications (e.g., changed Addendum 1 to Addendum Version 1.0) and to provide examples of qualified personnel (e.g., personnel from site or qualified health care agency) who may conduct s afety assessments, as indicated per protocol, during in -home visits.
