Dosage m aybe individualized within this range based on : thePK data type and severity of bleeding episodes the subject has experience din the past monitoring of appropriat e clinical and laboratory measures. Any further adjustment will have to be agreed w ith the s ponsor in advance . Treatment of Bleeding Episodes: Dosage must be individualized based on the subject’s weight, type and severity of bleeding episode and monitorin g of appropriate clinical and laboratory measures. In general, an initial dose of 40 -60 IU/kg VWF:RCo with 30-45 IU rFVIII [ADVATE ]/kg) is recommended (rVWF:rFVIII ratio of 1.3:1: ±0.2) . In cases of major bleeding episodes, a dose of up to 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo may be infused. Subsequent doses, if necessary, will be administered with or w ithout ADVATE to maintain VWF:RCo and FV III levels for as long as deemed necessary by the investigator.

BACKGROUND INFORMATIO N 6.1 Description of Investigational Product Baxter Healthcare Corporation (hereafter referred to as Baxter or sponsor) has developed a human recombinant von Willebrand Factor (rVWF), which is co-expressed with recombinant factor VIII (r FVIII )in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line and separ ated during the subsequent downstream process. To address concerns r egarding the risk of transmission of blood- bornepathogens that may be introduced by human plasma, no exogenousl y added raw materials of human or animal origin are employed in the cell culture, purification, or formulation of the final container product. T he only proteins present in the final container product other than rVWF are trace quantities of murine immunoglobulin (IgG, from the immunoaffinity purification), host cell (i .e., CHO) protein, rFurin (used to further process rVW F). rVWF is intended for the treatment of von Willebrand disease (VWD). rVWF has been developed under the Baxter internal code BAX111 and is used as investigational product (IP) in this study . rVWF may be used with or without ADVATE (rFV III) for the treatment of bleeding episodes (s ee Section 8.7.4.4). See Section 8.7for further information on the I Ps and their usage in this study ). A detailed description of rVWF is also provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) . 6.2 Clinical Condition/Indication Von Willebrand Factor ( VWF )is a large multimeric gl ycoprotein with a molecular weight that varies from 500 to 20,000 kDa. VWF is normally found in plasma and produced in the alpha -granules of platelets and in endothel ial cell organelles known as the Weibel -Palade bodies. VWF mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular injury , one of the key functions in primary hemostasis. VWF also serves to stabilize coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), where FVIII is an essential cofactor of secondary hemostasis, which leads to fibrin clot formation.1Qualitative and/or quantitative deficiencies of VWF lead to a highl y variable bleeding diathesis known as VWD, the most common of th e hereditary coagulation factor deficiencies . Penetrance of VWD is highly variable, with only a small fraction of mildly affected patients display ing clinical sy mptoms or a family history of a bleeding diathesis. For non-commercial use only"
19,page_19,"rVWF Page 19of 96 Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: 071301 2014 FEB 19 BAXTER CONFIDENTIAL –RESTRICTED: DO NOT D ISTRIBUTE WI THOUT PRIOR APPROVALThe current biochemical -based classificatio n distinguishes disorders arising from partial quantitative (ty pe 1), qualitative (ty pe 2), or virtually complete (t ype 3) deficiencies of VWF. Up to 70% of VWD patients are diagnosed with ty pe 1 VWD, which may also be associated with minor functional defe cts in the molecule. In general, patients with ty pe 1 VWD display mild clinical sy mptoms. Approximately 20 to 30% of VWD patients are diagnosed with ty pe 2 VWD. Ty pe 2 VWD is further divided into 4 subty pes (A, B, N, and M), reflecting distinct classes of functional abnormalities. These defects result in abnormal functional and/or multimeric distribution patterns that facilitate their diagnosis. The bleeding diathesis is usually moderate and primarily affects the mucosal tissues. Type 2N VWD patients are sometimes misdiagnosed as mild hemophilia A. Finally , approximately 1% percent of VWD patients exhibit a total or near total absence of VWF, which is classified as t ype 3 VWD. The incidence of ty pe 3 VWD is estimated at 0.5-1.0 x 106. This ty pe is also assoc iated with a very low FVIII level (t ypically < 5%) because the VWF carrier function for FVIII is lost. Replacement of VWF alone stabilizes endogenous FVIII, resulting in hemostatic levels within several hours post -infusion. Published results from studies of a plasma - derived VWF concentrate demonstrated an increase of FVIII at an approximate rate of 5.8 1 IU dL-1h-1.2Type 3 VWD patients display severe hemorrhagic s ymptoms with bleeding predominantl y in mucosal tissues, muscle and joints. All VWD patients, particularl y those with ty pe 2 or t ype 3 VWD, are at an increased risk for life -threatening bleeding episodes. 6.3The role of prophylaxis in the management of VWD The goals of long term prophy laxis in VWD are to maintain VWF and FVIII at sufficient levels to reduce the frequency and duration of bleeding episodes, the need for red blood cell transfusions, and the risk of complications, such as arthropath y.3In contrast to hemophilia ,routine prophy laxis is not as established in VWD ,although prophylaxis for patients with severe VWD have alread y been in use in Sweden during the 1950s4.In those earl y days of VWD treatment plasma FVIII concentrates containing VWF fractions were applied for replacement therap y,which then were followed b y plasma derived VWF productscontaining fractions of FVIII (pdVWF/FVIII). A Swedish cohort including 37 patients with t ype 3 VWD under proph ylactic median treatment of 11 years (range 2 to 45 years) was retrospectivel y anal yzed5;6.The doses used for proph ylaxis,given once weekl yfor at least 45 weeks per year, were calculated based on 12 to 50 IU/ kgbody weight (BW)of factor VIII clotting activity (FVIII:C ) which approxim ately corresponded to 24 -100 IU/kg von Wil lebrand factor: Ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:R Co)considering that mainly Haemate with a known VWF:RCo/FVIII:C ratio of about 2 was used. An escalation of doses from one to three dose levels was allowed depending on the frequency and severity of bleed ings. For non-commercial use only"

Whereas the median value for bleeds per year was about 10 before prophy laxis this value could be reduced to less than 1 bleed per year during prophy laxis. The benefit of proph ylaxis for such indications was retrospectivel y also demonstrated in a cohort of Italian patients including t ype 3, 2A, 2M and type 1 patients. Prophylaxis was started after sever egastrointestinal or joint bleedings and c ompletel y prevented bleedings in 8 of these 11 patients and largel y reduced the need of blood transfusions in the remaining three. A regimen of 40 IU rVWF:RCo/kg was applied every other day or twice a week. A prospective study on proph ylaxis, the PRO.WILL study , has been initiated in Italy7. The results of a prospective study investigating the prophy laxis inchildren and young adults showed a significantly reduced bleeding frequency and bleeding score ( 3 vs. 0.07; 3 vs. 0. p<0.001) compared to the pre- prophy laxis values. The median dose was 40 (20-47) IU /kgVWF:RCo administered mainly twice weekl yin 23 pat ients , three times a week in 7 patients and four times a week in 2 children8. The VWD Prophy laxis Network initiated the VWD Intern ational Proph ylaxis (VI P) trial to investigate the role of prophy laxis in patients with severe VWD including Ty pe 1, 2 and3. The dose of the factor replaceme nt product was 50 IU /kgVWF:RCo. The frequency of the dose depended on the t ype of bleeding and could be increased from once weekl y to twice weekl y orthree times per week. For the treatment of men orrhagia the dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo was given on the first day ofmenses for 2 cy cles. The frequency could be increased to day 1 and 2 for 2 cy cles or to day 1, 2, and 3 of menses . The study contains both retrospective and prospective study components. Results from theretrospective study component were published, including s ixty-one s ubjects on prophy lactic regimen in the past 6 months prior to enrollment or subjects with a history of prophy laxis over at least 6 month9.Differenc es in annualized bleeding rates (ABR) within individuals (during proph ylaxis –before prophy laxis) were significant for those with primary indications of epistaxis (P = 0.0005), joint bleeding (P = 0.002) and gastrointestinal ( GI)bleeding (P = 0.001). Thedifference in the group whose primary indication for treatment was abnormall y heav y bleeding at menstruation (n = 4) was not significant (P = 0.25). The reduction of mucosal bleeding likely not only dependen t s on normal circulating levels of active VWF, b ut also on the presence of discrete concentrations of normal VWF inside the platelets and within endothelial matrices. The low subject number (n=4) and the treatment scheme for menorrhagia on days 1, 2, and 3 of menses which might represent rather on- deman dthan proph ylactic treatment may also account for the outcome in this study .

There is evidence that up to 40 % of patients with ty pe 3 VWD experience joint bleeding which can lead to hemophilic arthropathy . Other potential indications for proph ylaxis include patients with ty pe 2A or 2B VWD with recurrent gastrointestina l bleeding, menorrhagia or frequent epistaxis3. Long-term prophy laxis for most patients with ty pe 3 VWD and in some patients with ty pe 1 or 2 VWD, depending on the pattern of bleeding, may be the treatment option of choice .Although the main experience with long -term prophy laxis is wi th secondary proph ylaxis, primary prophy laxis starting at y oung age is recommended to prevent art hropathy in patients with severe VWD .10 However, further studies are needed to develop evidence -based guidelines for prophy lactic treatment in VWD. 6.4Population to b e Studied A total of approximately 18eligible , adult subjects to achieve approximately 15 evalua ble subjects with severe VWD are planned to be enrolled, of which a subset of at least 5subjects will have ty pe 3 VWD. Enrolled subjects (i .e., subjects who have signed the informed consent form) will be eligible to participate in the study if they meet a ll of the inclusion criteria (see Section 9.1) and none of the exclusion criteria (see Section 9.2). 6.5Findings f rom Nonclinical and Clinical Studies The following summarizes the key findings from rel evant nonclinical studies as well as from the completed clinical Phase 1 study 070701 and071104.

Time to occlusion and stable th rombus formation was asse ssed in the carotid occlusion m odel in VWD mice. The results demonstrated that rVWF in combination with ADVATE acted efficiently in a dose -depend ent manner and had higher efficacy than rVWF alone or plasma derived ( pd)VWF. These results were confirmed in an add itional study assessing blood loss and survival in a tail tip bleeding model in VW D mice . In a VWD dog rVWF stabilized canine FVIII in the circulation and significantl y reduced the bleeding time. For non-commercial use only"

Safety Pharm acology Studies in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits and dogs revealed no risks for anaph ylactoid and thrombogenic potential of ADVATE in combination with rVWF. All observations in safety pharmacology studies are considered to lie within the biological variabilit y of animal models or occurred due to known species -specific anaphy lactoid effects of excipients . 6.5.1.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies of both rVWF alone and combined with human rFVIII (rVWF+ ADVATE) were conducted in VWD mice, VWD dogs, VWD pigs, rats and cynomolgus monkey s. Human rVWF stabilized the endogenous FVIII in VWD mice, VWD pigs and VWD dogs. Furthermore, the h ypotheses that the area under the curve (AUC )with rVWF alone and rVWF+ ADVATE is not inferior to the AUC with pdVWF (Haemate P ) was tes ted and confirmed statistically in normal rats. The pharmacokinetic (PK)characteristics of ADVATE were not affected by co-administration of rVWF in cynomolgus monkey s. The PK data in the FVIII knock out ( k.o.) mice model are inconclusive and might not be relevant for the clinical situation. However, a stabilizing effect of VWF on FVIII could be shown in a double knock out model in a dose depend ent manner. 6.5.1.4 Toxicology Single dose toxicity studies were conducted in C57BL/6J -mice, VWD mice, rats, rabbits, and cynomolgus monkeys. Rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkey s showed no signs of toxicity . Signs of microthrombosis, an exaggerated pharmacological effect, were observed in mice. Mice are not capable of sufficiently cleaving the rVWF subunit as murine disinteg rin and m etalloproteinase with a thrombo spondin ty pe 1 motif, number 13 (ADAMTS13 )does not decrease the ultra -large molecular weight multimers of rVWF11. The observed s ymptoms of microthrombosis are interpreted as a species -specific exaggerated pharmacological effect. Studies evaluating the safet y of repeated administration of rVWF with or without ADVATE (daily over 14 day s) were performed in a rodent (rat) and non -rodent (cy nomolgus monkey ) species. Reversible signs of exaggerated pharmacological effects (regenerative anemia, thrombocy topenia, and treatment -related histopathologic changes in the heart, liver, and spleen) were observed in rats that were administered 1400 U VWF:RCo/kg /day + 1080 IU ADVATE /kg/day intravenously once daily for 14 day s.

No toxicologically relevant changes were evident for clinical observations, body weight, feed consumption, ophthalmology , urinaly sis, coagulation and serum chemistry parameters, platelet aggregation, and gro ss pathology . rVWF combined with ADVATE was well tolerated in cy nomolgus monkey safter dail y intravenous ( i.v.)(bolus) administration of 100 U VWF:RCo/kg rVWF combined with 77IU/kg ADVATE over a period of 14 day s. No adverse effects could be detected in this species. There were no signs of hemoly sis, thrombosis or thrombocy topenia after repeated intravenous application of rVWF with or without ADVATE . Therefore, 100 U VWF:RCo/kg/day rVWF with or without 77 IU/kg ADVATE was considered the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL )inthis study , which was the highest dose tested. Anti -drug antibodies, however, were formed in both species and resulted in a significant reduction in drug exposure after 14 applications as compared to a single application. These an tibodies substantially reduced the sy stemic exposure to the test substance as compared to a single dose administration. No adverse effects due to antibody formation were observed in both species. rVWF combined with ADVATE was well tolerated locally and no genotoxic potential was evident after two in vitro and one in vivo genotoxicity study .A study on the influence of co- administration of VWF and ADVATE onthe immunogenicity of ADVATE in three different hemophilic mouse models (E17 hemophilic Balb/c mice, E 17 hemophilic C57BL/6J mice and E17 hemophilic human F8 transgenic mice) showed that rVWF does not negatively impact the immunogenicit y of ADVATE in an y of the three different hemophilic mouse models. 6.5.2 Findings from Clinical Studies Two phase 1 studies wit h rVWF either alone or co - administrated with ADVATE in patients with VWD 070701 and Hemophilia A 071104 have been conducted and t he results were anal yzed and evaluated .

Subjects in Cohort 4 received a single intravenous infusion of rVWF: ADVATE and pdVWF/ ADVATE at 50 I U/kg VWF:RCo in random order. The primary endpoint was the tolerability and safety after single dose injections of rVWF: ADVATE at 2, 7.5, 20 and 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo for up to 30 days after the last I P infusion. The data generated in this phase 1 study suggest that rVWF: ADVATE up to the highest investigated dose of 50 IU /kgVWF:RCo is well tolerated and safe in adults with severe VWD. No thrombogenic risk or TTP -like sy ndrome was observed, and no inhibitory antibodies to VWF or FVIII were identified. There were no deaths or other serious adverse reactions, and no infusions were interrupted or stopped due to an AE. Overall, the reported AE profile was similar between the recombinant and plasma - derived concentrates. Secondar y endpoints were the PK assessment of VWF:RCo, von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag )and multimeric composition of rVWF as well as FVIII:C at standardized time points after single injections o f rVWF: ADVATE and pdVW F:FVIII. The median VWF:RCo half-life ( T1/2)of rVWF at the 50 IU/kg dose was 16 hours. T 1/2 with pdVWF:FVIII at the same dose level appeared shorter at 12.58 h ours, however, the limits of the 90% CI were similar (11.73 to 17.7 hours vs. 11.87 to 18.03 h ours) . The median half -li vesof VWF:RCo w ereshorter with the lower investigated doses: 7.13 hours and 13.23 hours with the 7.5 IU/kg and 20 IU/kg doses, although these data were derived from a much sm aller number of subjects. In consequence of the missing ADAMTS13 cleavage ultra -large molecular weight (ULMW) multimers are contained in the rVWF final product. The immediate cleavage of these ultra -large multimers by ADAMTS13 upon release into the circulation could be demonstrated appl ying Sodium dodecy l sulfa te poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS- PAGE )/Immunoblot with poly clonal an ti-VWF antibodies to detect the resulting rVWF subunit cleavage fragments.

All subjects underwent 3 PK analy ses: the first after infusion with ADVATE alone, the second after infusion with ADVATE plus 10 I U/kg rVWF and the third after infusion with ADVATE plus 50 IU/kg rVWF. The PK anal ysis was performed at intervals of approximately 8 to 14 day s. Before each infusion for PK assessment there wasa wash -out period of at least 5 day s and the subjects were not activel y bleeding. Primary outcome measures indicate that co -administration of rVWF slightly sustain ADVATE activity with the hi ghest observed ADVATE half-life of 13.74 h (CI 11.44 to 16.52) after co- infusion of 50 IU/ kg ADVATE plus 50 I U/kg rVWF :RCo . The highest improvement in ADVATE circulating half -life was observed in subjects with VWF:Ag levels below 100% which indicates an as sociation between baseline VWF:Ag levels and ADVATE half-life increase. No treatment related adverse events ( AEs) or serious adverse events ( SAEs )were reported . No subject withdrew due to an AE and there were no deaths. No binding antibodies to VWF, CHO and rFurin were detectable in the confirmatory assay and no signs of a h ypersensi tivity to rVWF or ADVATE antigen were observed. Laboratory values over time did not indicate an y potential safety risk for hemophilia A patients treated with rVWF and ADVATE in combination. In summary , the data indicate that rVWF co-administered with ADVATE up to the highest dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo is well tolerated and safe in hemophilia A patients. For non-commercial use only"

Human VWF produced b y recombinant technology could offer a new perspective in treatment of VWD. The benefit for the indiv idual subject is anticipa ted to be significant during this clinical study . He/she may benefit from a product that minimizes excessive FVIII administration. Variations in VWF multimeric composition may lead to variabilit y with respect to treating or preventing bleeds in VWD subjects, especiall y mucosal bleeds which are especially problematic. rVWF product manufactured by Baxter consistently contains ultra -large molecular weight (ULMW) VWF multimers due to the fact that the product has not been exposed to ADAMTS13. The initial presence of these ULMW VWF multimers, which are subsequently cleaved by the subject’s endogenous ADAMTS13, may result in improved platelet and collagen binding and therefore provide more p redictable treatment outcomes. By using a recombi nant product, the risk of contamination with blood derived viruses or variant Creutzfeldt- Jakob Disease associated with the use of products of human or animal origin has been virtuall y eliminated. At this stage of product development, the key societal bene fit is a better understanding of advanced treatment options for VWD and enhanced product availability . These benefits outweigh the following potential risks of rVWF: allergic t ype h ypersensitivity reactions as with an y intravenous protein product the occur rence of thrombotic events the development of neutralizing antibodies to VWF Refer to the IB for further details on benefits and risks of the I P. 6.7Compliance Statement This study will be conducted in accordance with this protocol, the I nternational Confere nce on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 (ICH GCP, April 1996), Title 21 of the US Code of Federal Regulations (US CFR), the European Clinical Trial Directive (2001/20/EC and 2005/28/EC), and applicable national and local regulatory requirements.

Refer to Table 4for stud y procedures and Table 5for clinical laboratory assessments . 8.7.4.3 Prophylaxis Treatment The standard proph ylaxis is an infusion of 50±10IU/kg rVWF:RCo administered three times per week. Examples of possible dosingschedule are given in Table 1. Table 1. rVWF Dosing Schedule Examples : Schedules 1 and 2 Example Mon Tues Wed Thurs Fri Sat Sun Schedule 1 X X X Schedule 2 X X X Any further dose and frequency adjustment will be agreed with the sponsor in advance unless it constitutes an urgent safet y measure . Dose adjustments to higher doses (not exceedi ng the upper dose limit of 80 I U/kg rVWF:RCo) and adjustments to 4 times weekl yadministration will only be allowed in case sof persisting high bleeding rates due to insufficient therapeutic response . Dose and frequency reduction will only be allowed in case plasma VWF or FVI II levels areexceeding the recommended ranges. If a subject does not adequately respond to rVWF therapy , he/she will be evaluated for the presence of inhibitory and total binding anti -VWF antibodies (see Section 12.9.3.2) . I tis essential for the success of this study that the subjects adhere to treatment regimens. Therefore, procedures for monitoring subject’s compliance are implemented (see Section 10.7) . If one infusion of IP is missed, the subject may administer the IP as soon as possible .The subject should then adhere to the standard proph ylaxis treatment scheme ensuring a minimum interval of 12 hours between this and the previous IP infusion. For example , a subject routinely infuses IP on Mo nday , Wednesday and Friday ,he/she misses the Wednesday time point and therefore may infuse the I P on the next day (Thursday )and thereafter proceed with infusing the IP on Friday (considering a minimum 12 hours between the infusions ) and return to the ini tially chosen schedule.

In the event a healthcare professional is required to administer IP, he/she must be trained and qualified b y the sponsor on the above procedures prior to the decision for home treatment. A Subject Guideline detailing all instructions and information listed above will be provided t o each subject. 8.7.4.4 Treatment of Bleeding Episodes 8.7.4.4.1 General Instructions for Home Treatment of Bleeding Episodes If a subject experiences a bleeding episode, he/she should contact the study site immediately and the site investigator should provide instructions on the treatment regimen. If the subject initiates the treatment at home, he/she should at least follow up with the study site if avisit is needed as per hospital standard . In the event a healthcare professional is required to administer treatment at th e subject’s home, he/she must be trained and qualified b y the sponsor on the above procedures prior to the decision for home treatment .Once a subject has received 1infusion of rVWF in the clinic (either during planned I P exposure or during the t reatment of a bleeding episode) and meets the criteria for home treatment, the treatment of bleeding episodes with I P can be conducted at home (see Section 8.7.4.3.1). If a subject is not qualified for home treatment, rVWF infusions must be administered at the study site. For non-commercial use only"

Treatment with I P must occur at the study site unless the subject has previously qualified for home treatment with rVWF . If rVWF treatment is not feasible, the subject may use his/her standard of care, such as commercial pdVWF/FVIII products. In any case a washout period of at le ast 5 days is required prior to rVWF PK infusion at the PK assessment visit . If a subject experiences a bleeding episode requiring treatment during the PK assessment, rVWF will be used to treat the bleed. Blood draws for PK assessment will be stopped and the PK assessments will be repeated once the bleed has resolved and the subject is free of any symptoms related with the bleeding episode . Dose and frequency of rVWF infusions or an y other replacement therap y to stop the bleed should be recorded in the e -CRF. 8.7.4.4.2 Dosing Recommendations for Treatment of Bleeding Episodes If an acute bleeding episode occurs ,the subject will be treated with rVWF with or without ADVATE . In general initially , an infusion of rVWF: ADVATE at a rVWF: ADVATE ratio of 1.3:1±0.2 will be administered. Subsequent infusion smay either use rVWF alone or with ADVATE, based on FVIII levels, if available. If FVIII levels are not available, dosing is at the discretion of the investigator based upon the individual subject’s PK data. Using ADVATE in addition to rVWF in subsequent doses carries the risk of an excessive rise in FVIII:C. Therefore, reduced doses of ADVATE and/or prolongation of the dose interval should be considered. In general the aim of the initial dose should be full replacement of VWF with VWF:RCo levels of > 0.6 IU/ml (60%) and FVIII:C of > 0.4 IU/mL (40%). In major bleeding episodes ,subsequent doses should keep the trough level of VWF:RCo >50% for 3 day s and then as deemed necessary by the investigator for subsequent days. In m oderate bleeding episodes, the dose and trough level may be reduced to >30% for as long as deemed necessary by the investigator. Treatment for minor bleeding episodes will generall y consist of onl y 1 or 2 doses of rVWF IP. If the VWF:RCo level is above 15 0%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 12 hours; if the VWF:RCo level is above 200%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 24 hours. In either case, a lower subsequent dose (e.g., 20 IU/kg VWF:RCo) may be appropriate. Dosing reco mmendations are listed in Table 2. For non-commercial use only"

In the p hase 1 study 070701, 1.0 IU/kg VWF:RCo raised the circulating level of VWF:RCo by 0.017 IU/mL (1.7 %). In the same study , the o bserved mean half -life for rVWF was 19.3 hours, with a st andard deviation of 10.9 hours. Table 2 rVWF:RCo Dosing Recommendations for the Treatm ent of Bleedings due to VWD Classification of VWD Hem orrhage Dosage (IU VWF:RCo/kg body weight) Type 1 Severe (Baseline VWF:RCo activity typically <20%) Minor (e.g. epistaxis, oral bleeding, menorrhagia) 40 to 50 IU/kg (1 or 2 doses) Major (e.g. severe or refractory epistaxis, menorrhagia, GI bleeding, CNS trauma, hemarthrosis, or traumatic hemorrhage)Initial dose 50 to 75 IU/kg, then 40 to 60 IU/kg every 8 to 12 hours for 3 days to keep the trough level of VWF:RCo >50%; then 40 to 60 IU/kg daily for a total of up to 7 days of treatment. Type 2 (all variants) and Type 3 Minor (clinical indications above) 40 to 50 IU/kg (1 or 2 doses) Major (clinical indications above)Initial dose of 60 to 80 IU/kg, then 40 to 60 IU/kg every 8 to 12 hours for 3 days to keep the trough level of VWF:RCo >50%; then 40 to 60 IU/kg daily for a total of up to 7 days of treatment. Variances of up to 10% in dosing are permissible during treatment of bleeding episodes, but rounding to the nearest vial size should be avoided. Subjects with non- neutralizing binding anti -VWF antibodies should initially be treated with a dose known to be efficacious based on the subject’s medical treatment history which may differ from the recommen dations provided in Table 2. Subjects should be monitored for lack of efficacy as well as for FVIII (mandatory ), VWF:RCo (m andatory ), and VWF:Ag (optional where testing is not available) levels after 3 - 6hours. Re -dosing with rV WF in combination with ADVATE using the same (initial) dose and adaptation of the dosing frequency should be considered until cessation of the bleed, if the FVIII and/or VWF:RCo levels drop below 30% -50% depending on bleeding severit y. The number of subseq uent infusions and the dosage levels prescribed will be determined by the investigator on the basis of the clinical severity , response to current therapy , available laboratory data, and the subject’s historical treatment for similar bleeding episode s.

All ty pes of bleeds, including traumatic bleeds, will be recorded, however only spontaneous bleeds requiring VWF treatment will be considered for the assessment of ABRs used for primary outcome assessment . Bleeds occurring at the same anatomical location ( e.g., right knee) with the same etiology (i.e., spontaneous vers us injury ) within 24 h ours after onset of the first bleed will be considered a single bleed. Bleeding occurring at multiple locations related to the same injury (e.g., knee and ankle bleeds following a fall) will be counted as a single bleeding episode. For non-commercial use only"

An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign ( e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom (e. g., rash, pain, discomfort, fever, dizziness, etc.) , disease (e.g., peritonitis, bacteremia, etc.),or outcome of death temporally associated with the use of an IP, whether or not considered causall y related to the I P. 12.1.1.1 Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose meets one or m ore of the following criteria: Outcome is fatal/results in death (including fetal death) Is life -threatening – defined as an event in which the subject was, in the judgment of the investigator, at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer t o an event that h ypotheticall y might have caused death had it been more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization –inpatient hospitalization refers to any inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay . Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (i.e.,a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) Is acongenital anomal y/birth defect Is a medicall y important event –a medical event that may not be immediately life- threatening or result in death or require hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definitions above. Examples of such events are: Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood d yscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependence or drug abuse Reviewed and confirmed seroconversion for human immunod eficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), or parvovirus B19 (B19V) Development of inhibitory VWF antibodies Development of inhibitory antibodies to FVIII (titer ≥ 0.4BU(by Nijmegen- modified Bethesda assay) or ≥0.6 BU(by Bethesda assay)) For non-commercial use only"

However, when there is an increase in the severit y, duration, or frequency of a preexisting disease, the event mu st be described on the AE CRF. 12.1.2 Assessment of Adverse Events For the purposes of this study , the following will not be considered as AEs and will not be included in the analy sis of AEs. Bleeding episodes are part of the underl ying disease and therefore are not AEs; they will be evaluated in the context of efficacy . If a bleeding episode was caused by an injury , the injury would not be reported as an AE, unless it resulted in a medical finding other than a bleeding episode (e.g., abrasion of skin). Therefore, any VWD - related bleeding event (e.g., epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, musculo -skeletal bleeding, menorrhagia) will not be reported as AEs. However, the investigator may decide that the event is an AE if the event also would have occurred in a health y individual under the same circumstances. For non-commercial use only"

Each AE from the first IP exposure to the study completion date will be described on the AE CRF using the medical diagnosis (preferred), or, if no diagnosis could be established at the time of reporting the AE, a symptom or sign, in standard medical terminology in order to avoid the use of vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions (see definition in Section 12.1). Each AE will be evaluated b y the investigator for: Seriousness as defined in Section 12.1.1.1 Severity as defined in Section 12.1.2.1 Causal relati onship to I P exposure or study procedure as defined in Section 12.1.2.2 For each AE, the outcome (i .e., recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved, recovered/resolved with sequelae, not recovered/not resolved, fatal , unknown ) and if applicable action taken (i .e., dose increased, dose not changed, dose reduced, drug interrupted, drug withdrawn , not applicable, or unknown ) will also be recorded on the AE CRF. Recovering/resolving AEs will be followed until resolution . If the severi ty rating for an ongoing AE changes before the event resolves, the original AE report will be revised (i.e., the event will not be reported as separate AE). During the course of an y AE, the highest severit y rating will be reported. Deviations from the prot ocol-specified dosage (including underdosing /overdosi ng [ < 20 IU/kg rVWF:RCo or > 100 rVWF:RCo], abuse, and withdrawal, treatment errors (including incorrect route of administration, use of an incorrect product, and deviations from the protocol -defined do sing schedule), failures of expected pharmacological actions, and unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefits will be followed with regard tooccurrence of AEs, lack of efficacy , and/or other observations because these events may be reportable to regulator y authorities. Any pregnancy that occurs after administration of IP will be reported on a Pregnancy Form and followed- up at 1 y ear post- delivery , if feasible.

These severity definitions will also be used to assess the severity of an AE with a study- related procedure(s), if necessary . 12.1.2.2 Causality Causality is a determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the I P is etiologicall y related to/associated with the AE. Causality assessment includes, e .g., assessment of temporal relationships, dechallenge/rechallenge information, association (or lack of association) with underly ing disease, presen ce (or absence) of a more likely cause, and ph ysiological plausibility .For each AE, the investigator will assess the causal relationship between the IP and the AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment according to the following most appropriate al gorithm for the circumstances of the AE: Not related (both circumstances must be met) Is due to underl ying or concurrent illness, complications, concurrent treatments, or effects of concurrent drugs Is not associated with the I P (i.e., does not follow a re asonable temporal relationship to the administration of I P or has a much more likel y alternative etiology ).

Therefore ,caution is advised in interpreting positive results. In particular ,any clinical association, changes in the natural history of the disease, effect of therap y, etc. needs to be taken into account for final judgment. Thesponsor ’s Medical Director should be consulted for additional advice. As part of the AE follow -up, an y sample testing positive needs to be confirmed after 2 -4 weeks for central laboratory testing. Only confirmed neutralizing anti -VWF antibodies are considered inhibitors (see Section 12.9.3.4) . These subjects need to be closely monitored and therap y adjusted accordingl y. 12.9.3.3 Binding antibodies to VWF The presence of total binding anti -VWF antibodies will be de termined b y an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) employ ing poly clonal anti -human Immunoglobulin (Ig)antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA). For this assay (ELI SA), recombinant human VWF will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then incubated with dilutions of the positive control, the negative control or test sample. Antibodies against human VWF that are present in the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -coupled goat anti- human antibody (secondary antib ody). The positive control for this assay will be a human monoclonal antibody specific for human VWF spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human plasma. Plasma samples are analy zed for binding antibodies aga inst the specific antigen in two steps. First, the sample is screened for antibodies and the titer of binding antibodies is determined. Second, the specificit y of positive antibody results is confirmed.13In brief, all samples are seriall y diluted (initial dilution 1:20 and further diluted 1:2). The titer endpoint, defined as the highest dilution that still gives a positive signal above cut off level, is determined in two independent duplicates. The cut off level is established based on background signal level of health y plasma donors (n=160) and set to include 5% false positives to be as sensitive as possible (95% percentile). The ELI SA assay is validated allowing a nassay variability of ± 1 titer step. Therefore, differences ≤2 titers steps may be due to variabilit y of the ELI SA assay . Specificity has to be confirmed in a compet ition assay when a sample has a titer of 1:80 or higher in the screening assay . Based on the validation criteria samples tested in the screening assay at 1:20 or 1:40 cannot be confirmed in the competition assay .

Antibody titers of subject samples will only be reported as positive, if the results of the screening and confirmatory anal ysis fulfill these acceptance criteria. The titer to be reported is alway s the one determined in the original screening procedure (independent of the result of the re -screening in the confirmation procedure). A more det ailed test procedure will be supplied upon request or pro- actively if a sample tests positive. A treatment related increase of the binding anti -VWF antibodies is expected, if the titer increases by more than 2 titration steps. These subjects need to be closely monitored and therapy adjusted accordingly . 12.9.3.4 Neutralizing antibodies to VWF Three functional VWF assay s, collagen binding (VWF:CB) assay , Ristocetin cofactor (VWF:RCo) and FVIII binding (VWF:FVIIIB), will be used to test for the presence of inhibitory anti-VWF antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies to VWF:RCo, VWF:CB and VWF:FVIIIB activities will be measured b y assay s based on the Bethesda assay established for quantitative anal ysis of FVIII inhibitors (Nijmegen modification of the Bethes da assay ).14The amount of inhibitor is expressed as Bethesda units (BU) per mL. One BU is thereb y defined as the amount of inhibitor that decreases the measured activ ity in the assay s to 50% of that of the negative control samples. The assay s were validated using human plasma samples from two ty pe 3 VWD patients with low (1 -2 BU/mL) and high ( ~10BU/mL) titer inhibitors and plasma samples from non -human primates immunized with human rVWF (>100 BU/mL) If a subject has a measurable baseline level of VWF activity in the respective assay , it is taken into account in the calculation of the residual activity .However, if baseline levels are to ohigh (>15% VWF:RCo), inhibitor s may not be reliabl ydetected. To exclude false positive results, the detection limit for anti-VWF inhibitors was set to 1BU/ml for all 3 assay s. The rationale for this cut -off value is the relativel y high confidence interval of the underl ying assay s,making determinations at the end of the evaluation range of the Bethesda reference curve uncer tain.15 A more detailed test procedure may be requested to further characterize the anti -VWF inhibitors, if detected.

If the information is not alread y available in the subject’s medical history , it has to be determined at the local lab. 12.9.10 Additional Laboratory Testing in case of Thrombotic E vents rVWF contains ultra large molecular weight (ULMW) multimers because of a lack of exposure to endoge nous VWF protease ( a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin ty pe 1 motif, member 13 ( ADAMTS13) during the manufacturing process. In vitro and in vivo cleavage of these ultralarge molecular fractions by ADAMTS13 and generation of characteri stic satellite bands has been extensively demonstrated during nonclinical and clinical development. Nevertheless, the potential elevated risk of thrombosis and/or other thromboembolic complications due to the administration of ultra large molecular VWF multimers in subjects with normal levels of VWF cannot be completely excluded. Therefore VWF multimer analy sis will not only be performed routinel y at screening but i n case of thrombotic events both VWF multimer analysis as well as ADAMTS13 activity will be determined to assess an y relatedness of these occurrences with IP treatment. 12.9.10.1 VWF multimers analysis The VWF multimers pattern will be assessed using low -resolution sodium dodecy l sulfate (SDS) –agarose gel electrophoresis.

Data for an association between the sP - selectin concentration, thrombotic thrombocy topenic purpura (TTP)and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are limited and the predicti ve value has not yet established. A commercial ELISA assay will be employ ed as an exploratory test. sP-selectin will be determined at the Screening visit and used as indicator for an increased thrombotic risk. 12.9.12 D- Dimer D-dimer will be used as a marker for DVT and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) . While a negative result practically rules out thrombosis, a positive result can indicate thrombosis but does not rule out other potential etiologies, including a recent hemorrhage. Its main use, therefor e, is to exclude thromboembolic disease where the probability is low. D-Dimer will be measured at the Screening visit and used as indicator for an increased thrombotic risk. 12.9.13 Additional Laboratory Testing in C ase of Severe Allergic R eactions (e.g. Anap hylaxis) If a subject develops a severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaph ylaxis)in the course of the clinical study , additional blood dr a ws for anti-VWF IgE antibod y testing will be drawn.

For the prospectivel y recorded overall annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of spontane ous bleedings during proph ylactic treatment as well as for the historical ABR of spontaneous bleedings, means and corresponding 90% two -sided confidence intervals based on the negative binomial distribution will be estimated . The confidence intervals will be calculated within a generalized linear model framework (with a logarithmic link function which is the default for the negative binomial distribution), accounting for the logarithm of follow -up time (in y ears) as an offset. The annualized rate of bleedin g episodes will be calculated as (Number of bleeding episodes/observed treatment period in day s) * 365.25. The primary efficacy analy sis will be based on the FAS. As a supportive analy sis, the same anal ysis will also be carried out on the PP. 13.4.2 Secondary Ou tcome Measure s 13.4.2.1 Efficacy For the number of infusions and for the total weight adjusted consumption of rVWF and ADVATE per month and per y ear, summary statistics will be carried out. For the number of subjects with reduction of ABR as well as for the number of subjects with 0 bleeds, proportions and corresponding 90% two -sided confidence intervals will be performed. The secondary efficacy analy sis will be performed on the FAS only . 13.4.2.2 Efficacy of the Treatment of Bleeding Episodes For the number of infusions of rVWF and ADVATE per bleeding episode, for the weight adjusted consumption of rVWF and ADVATE per bleeding event as well as for the overall hemostatic efficacy rating at resolution of bleed, summary statistics will be carried out.

Actual sampling times will be defined as time from the start of infusion to the blood sample coll ection time. A deviation from the protocol -specified blood sample drawing time window will not be a reason to exclude an observation from the anal ysis. Samples with unknown actual and planned collection date/time or where the concentration could not be det ermined, or where results were biologically implausible will be eliminated from the anal ysis. If any concentration data are considered spurious (e.g. lack of biological plausibility ), the reason for exclusion from the anal ysisand the analy sis from which t he data point was excluded will be documented. To ensure that values at baseline (pre -infusion) are not affecting the estimation of PK parameters, post -infusion concentration data will be adjusted for baseline as follows: t Measured,C ) Tmax Measured,Cinfusion pre Measured,C (1t Corrected,C   After adjustment of the post -infusion concentration data, an y pre -infusion data will be set to 0. CCorrected will be set to missing, if: Samples have an unknown draw time or where the concentration could not be determined, or where results were deemed to be unreliable due to anal ytical i ssues. Any concentration data are considered spurious (e.g. lack of biological plausibility ). Handling of concentrations that are below the quantification limit: Baseline concentration values reported as below the limit of quantification will be considere d to be 0 ( CCorrected = Concentration value) Post-infusion concentration values reported as below the limit of quantification or missing repeated concentration values will be set to missing ( CCorrected = missing) The area under the plasma concentration/t ime curve from time 0 to infinity (AUC 0-) and the area under the first moment curve from time 0 to infinity (AUMC 0-) will be calculated as the sum of AUC or AUMC from time 0 to the time of last quantifiable concentration plus a tail area correction calcu lated as C t/zand C t/z(t + 1/ z), respectivel y, where Ctis the last quantifiable concentration, t is the time of last quantifiable concentration and zis the terminal or disposition rate constant.

BACKGROUND INFORMATION 6.1 Description of Investigational Product Baxalta US Inc. (here after referred to as Baxalta or sponsor) has developed a human recombinant von Willebrand Factor (rVWF), which is co-expressed with r ecombinant factor VIII (r FVIII )in a Chinese hamste r ovary (CHO) cell line andsepar ated during the subsequent downstream process. To address concerns regarding the risk of transmission of blood- bornepathogens that may be introduced by human plasma, no exogenousl y added raw materials of human or animal origin are employ ed in the cell culture, purification, or formulation of the final container product. The onl y proteins present in the final container product other than rVWF are trace quantities of murine immunoglobulin (IgG, from the immunoaffinity purification), host cell (i.e. , CHO) protein, rFurin (used to further process rVW F). rVWF is intended for the treatment of von Willebrand disease (VWD). rVW F has been developed under the Baxalta internal code BAX111 and is used as investigational product (IP) in this study . rVWF may be used with or without ADVATE (rFV III) for the treatment of bleeding episodes (see Section 8.7.4.4). See Section 8.7for further information on the I Ps and their usage in this study .A detailed description of rVWF is also provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) . rVWF was granted licensure in the U nited States in Dec ember 2015 under the brand name VONVENDI for the on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes in adults diagnosed with VWD; as of the date of this protocol VONVENDI is not y et available on the market . 6.2Clinical Condition/Indication Von Willebrand Factor ( VWF )is a large multimeric gl ycoprotein with a molecular weight that varies from 500 to 20,000 kDa. VWF is normally found in plasma and produced in the alpha -granules of platelets and in endothelial cell organelles known as the Weibel -Palade bodies. VWF mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular injury , one of the key functions in primary hemostasis. VWF also serves to stabilize coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), where FVIII is an essential cofactor of secondary hemostasis, which leads to fibrin clot formation.2Qualitative and/or quantitative deficiencie s of VWF lead to a highl y variable bleeding diathesis known as VWD, the most common of the hereditary coagulation factor deficiencies . Penetrance of VWD is highly variable, with only a small fraction of mildly affected patients display ing clinical sy mptoms or a family history of a bleeding diathesis. For non-commercial use only"

Up to 70% of VWD patien ts are diagnosed with ty pe 1 VWD, which may also be associated with minor functional defects in the molecule. In general, patients with ty pe 1 VWD display mild clinical sy mptoms. Approximately 20 to 30% of VWD patients are diagnosed with ty pe 2 VWD. Ty pe 2 VWD is further divided into 4 subty pes (A, B, N, and M), reflecting distinct classes of functional abnormalities. These defects result in abnormal functional and/or multimeric distribution patterns that facilitate their diagnosis. The bleeding diathesis i s usually moderate and primarily affects the mucosal tissues. Type 2N VWD patients are sometimes misdiagnosed as mild hemophilia A. Finally , approximately 1% percent of VWD patients exhibit a total or near total absence of VWF, which is classified as t ype 3 VWD. The incidence of ty pe 3 VWD is estimated at 0.5-1.0 x 106. This ty pe is also associated with a ve ry low FVIII level (t ypically <5%) because the VWF carrier function for FVIII is lost. Replacement of VWF alone stabilizes endogenous FVIII, resulting i n hemostatic levels withi n several hours post -infusion. Published results from studies of a plasma-derived VWF concentrate demonstrated an increase of FVIII at an approximate rate of 5.8 1 IU dL-1h-1.3Type 3 VWD patients display severe hemorrhagic s ymptoms with bleeding predominantl y in mucosal tissues, muscle and joints. All VWD patients, particularl y those with ty pe 2 or t ype 3 VWD, are at an increased risk for life -threatening bleeding episodes. 6.3The role of prophylaxis in the management of VWD The goals of long term prophy laxis in VWD are to maintain VWF and FVIII at sufficient levels to reduce the frequency and duration of bleeding episodes, the need for red blood cell transfusions, and the risk of complications, such as arthropath y.4In contrast to hemophilia ,routine prophy laxis is not as established in VWD , although prophy laxis for patients with severe VWD have alread y been in use in Sweden during the 1950s.5In those earl y days of VWD treatment plasma FVIII concentrates containing VWF fractions were applied for replacement therap y,which then were followed b y plasma derived VWF products containing fractions of FVIII (pdVWF/FVIII). A Swedish cohort including 37 patients with t ype 3 VWD under proph ylactic median treatment of 11 years (range 2 to 45 years) was retrospectivel y anal yzed.6;7The doses used for proph ylaxis,given once weekly for at least 45 weeks per year, were calculated based on 12 to 50 IU/ kgbody weight (BW)of FVIII clotting activity (FVIII:C ) which approxim ately corresponded to 24 -100 IU/kg von Willebrand factor: Ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:R Co)considering that mainly Haemate with a known VWF:RCo/FVIII:C ratio of about 2 was used. An escalation of doses from 1to 3dose levels was allowed depending on the frequency and severit y of bleeding episodes . For non-commercial use only"

Whereas the median value for bleeds per year was about 10 before prophy laxis this value could be reduced to less than 1 bleed per year during prophy laxis. The benefit of proph ylaxis for such indications was retrospecti vely also demonstrated in a cohort of Italian patients including t ype 3, 2A, 2M and type 1 patients. Prophylaxis was started after sever egastrointestinal or joint bleeding episodes and completely prevented bleeding episodes in 8 of these 11 patients and l argel y reduced the need of blood transfusions in the remaining 3. A regimen of 40 IU rVWF:RCo/kg was applied every other day or twice a week. A prospective study on prophy laxis, the PRO.WILL study , has been initiated in I taly.8 The results of a prospective study investigating the prophy laxis inchildren and young adults showed a significantl y reduced bleeding frequency and bleeding score ( 3vs. 0.07; 3 vs. 0. p<0.001) compared to the pre- prophy laxis values. The median dose was 40(20-47) IU /kgVWF:RCo administered mainly twice weekly in 23 patients , 3 times a week in 7 patients and 4times a week in 2 children .9 The VWD Prophy laxis Network initiated the VWD Intern ational Proph ylaxis (VI P)trial to investigate the role of prophy laxis in patients with severe VWD including Ty pe 1, 2 , and3. The dose of the factor replaceme nt product was 50 IU /kgVWF:RCo. The frequency of the dose depended on the t ype of bleeding and could be increased from once weekl y to twice weekl y or3times per week. For the treatment of men orrhagia the dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo was given on the first day ofmenses for 2 cy cles. The f requency could be increased to D ay 1 and 2 for 2 cy cles or to Day 1, 2, and 3 of menses . The study contains both retrospective and prospective study components. Results from theretrospective study component were published, including 61 subjects on prophy lactic regimen in the past 6 months prior to enrollment or subjects wit h a history of prophy laxis over at least 6 month .10Differences in annualized bleeding rates (ABR) within individuals (during prophy laxis –before proph ylaxis) were significant for those with primary indications of epistaxis (P = 0.0005), joint bleeding (P = 0.002) and gastrointestinal ( GI)bleeding (P = 0.001). The difference in the group whose primary indication for treatment was abnormall y heavy bleeding at menstruation (n = 4) was not significant (P = 0.25). The reduction of mucosal bleeding likely not only dependen t s on normal circulating levels of active VWF, but also on the presence of discrete concentrations of normal VWF inside the platelets and within endothelial matrices. The low subject number (n=4) and the treatment scheme for menorrhagia on Days 1, 2, and 3 of menses which might represent rather on- demand than proph ylactic treatment may also account for the outcome in this study .

Sixsubjects presented with epistaxis, 3 with GI bleeding, and 2with joint bleeding. Seven subjects had dose escalation above the first level. Among the 10 subjects with evaluable bleeding log data, the use of prophy laxis decreased the median ABR from 25 to 6.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] of the rate difference: -51.6 to - 1.7), and the median ABR was even lower (4.0; 95% CI: -57.5 to - 5.3) when the subjects reached their final dosing level. The authors concluded that this was the first prospective study to demonstrate that proph ylaxis with VWF concentrates is highl y effective in reducing mucosal and joint bleedi ng rates in clinicall y severe VWD. The results of the VI P study and previous investigations suggest that VWD patients with recurrent bleeding episodes and s evere menorrhagia will benefit from a proph ylactic VWF replacement therapy . There is evidence that up to 40% of patients with ty pe 3 VWD experience joint bleeding which can lead to hemophilic arthropath y. Other potential indications for prophy laxis include patients with ty pe 2A or 2B VWD with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, menorrhagia or frequent e pistaxis .4Long-term prophy laxis for most patients with ty pe 3 VWD and in some patients with ty pe 1 or 2 VWD, depending on the pattern of bleeding, may be the treatment option of choice . Although the main experience with long -term prophy laxis is with secondary prophy laxis, primary proph ylaxis starting at young age is recommended to prevent art hropathy in patients with severe VWD.12 However, further studies are needed to develop evidence -based guidelines for prophy lactic treatment in VWD. 6.4Population to b e Studied A total of approximately 18eligible , adult subjects to achieve approximately 15 evaluable subjects with severe VWD are planned to be enrolled, of which a subset of at least 5subjects will have ty pe 3 VWD. Enrolled subjects (i .e., subjects who have signed the informed consent form) will be eligible to participate in the study if they meet all of the inclusion criteria (see Section 9.1) and none of the exclusion criteria (see Section 9.2).

Potential risks and efficacy of rVWF: ADVATE are summarized in the followi ng sections. For additional information on nonclinical and clinical Phase 1 results refer to the rVWF IB. 6.5.1 Findings from Nonclinical Studies 6.5.1.1 Primary Pharmacodynamics Efficacy of rVWF combined with ADVATE was shown in VWD animal models, which have also low endogenous FVIII levels. Time to occlusion and stable th rombus formation was asse ssed in the carotid occlusion m odel in VWD mice. The results demonstrated that rVWF in combination with ADVATE acted effic iently in a dose -depend ent manner and had higher efficacy than rVWF alone or plasma derived ( pd)VWF. These results were confirmed in an additional study assessing blood loss and survival in a tail tip bleeding model in VW D mice . In a VWD dog rVWF stabilize d canine FVIII in the circulation and significantl y reduced the bleeding time. 6.5.1.2 Safety Pharmacology The anaph ylactoid and thrombogenic potential of the co -infusion of ADVATE and rVWF and the co-infused product’s effects on blood pressure, cardiac and respi ratory function and parameters of coagulation activation were investigated in 4in vivo studies in different animal models. Safety pharma cology studies in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits ,and dogs revealed no risks for anaph ylactoid and thrombogenic potential o f ADVATE in combination with rVWF. All observations in safety pharmacology studies are considered to lie within the biological variability of animal models or occurred due to known species -specific anaphy lactoid effects of excipients . 6.5.1.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies of both rVWF alone and combined with human rFVIII (rVWF+ ADVATE ) were conducted in VWD mice, VWD dogs, VWD pigs, rats, and cynomolgus monkey s. Human rVWF stabilized the endogenous FVIII in VWD mice, VWD pigs ,and VWD dogs. Furthermor e, the h ypotheses that the area under the curve (AUC )with rVWF alone and rVWF+ ADVATE is not inferior to the AUC with pdVWF (Haemate P ) was tested and confirmed statistically in normal rats.

The PK data in the FVIII knock out (k.o.) mice model are inconclusive and might not be relevant for the clinical situation. However, a stabilizing effect of VWF on FVIII could be shown in a double kn ock out model in a dose depend ent manner. 6.5.1.4 Toxicology Single dose toxicity studies were conducted in C57BL/6J -mice, VWD mice, rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkeys. Rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkey s showed no signs of toxicity . Signs of microthrombosis, an exaggerated pharmacological effect, were observed in mice. Mice are not capable of sufficiently cleaving the rVWF subunit as murine disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombo spondin ty pe 1 motif, number 13 (ADAMTS13 )does not decrease the ultra -large molecular weight multimers of rVWF.13 The observed s ymptoms of microthrombosis are interpreted as a species -specific exaggerated pharmacological effect. Studies evaluating the safet y of repeated administration of rVWF with or without ADVAT E(daily over 14 day s) were performed in a rodent (rat) and non -rodent (cy nomolgus monkey ) species. Reversible signs of exaggerated pharmacological effects (regenerative anemia, thrombocy topenia, and treatment -related histopathologic changes in the heart, liver, and spleen) were observed in rats that were administered 1400 U VWF:RCo/kg /day + 1080 IU ADVATE /kg/day intravenously once daily for 14 day s. Also, these findings are interpreted as a species -specific exaggerated pharmacological effect due to the lo wsusceptibility of human rVWF to cleavage by rodent ADAMTS13.13Notoxicologicall y relevant changes were evident for clinical observations, body weight, feed consumption, ophthalmology , urinaly sis, coagulation, and serum chemistry parameters, platelet aggregation, and gross pathology .rVWF combined with ADVATE was well tolerated in cy nomolgus monkey s after daily intravenous ( i.v.) (bolus) administration of 100 U VWF:RCo/kg rVWF combined with 77 IU/kg ADVATE over a period of 14 day s. No adverse effects could be detected in this species. There were no signs of hemoly sis, thrombosis ,or thrombocytopenia after repeated intravenous application of rVWF with or without ADVATE . Therefore, 100 UVWF:RCo/kg/day rVWF with or without 77 IU/kg ADVATE was considered the no observed ad verse effect level ( NOAEL )inthis study , which was the highest dose tested. Anti -drug antibodies, however, were formed in both species and resulted in a significant reduction in drug exposure after 14 applications as compared to a single application. Thes e antibodies substantially reduced the sy stemic exposure to the test substance as compared to a single dose administration. No adverse effects due to antibody formation were observed in both species. For non-commercial use only"

Details on study design, populations enrolled ,and safety and efficacy outcomes of these 2 phase 1 studies are presented in Section 6.5.2.1 andSection 6.5.2.2, and the phase 3 stud y in Section 6.5.2.3. Information on a single subject with VWD in Study 071401 is presented in Section 6.5.2.4. Refer to rVWF IB for periodic updates from other rVWF studies. 6.5.2.1 Study 070701 Phase 1 clinical study 070701 was a multicenter, controlled, randomized, single -blind , prospective 3 -step, dose escalation study to investigate safet y, tolerability ,and PK of rVWF combined at a fixed ratio with ADVATE (VWF:RCo/FVIII:C of 1.3 ± 0.2:1) in adults with severe VWD .14Subjects were enrolled in sequential cohorts in a dose escalating manner: Cohort 1, 2, and 3 received a single intravenous infusion of rVWF: ADVATE at the following doses: 2 IU/kg VWF:RCo (Cohort 1), 7.5 IU/kg VWF:RCo (Cohort 2), and 20 IU/kg VWF:RCo (Cohort 3). Subjects in Cohort 4 received a single intravenous infusion of rVWF:ADVATE and pdVWF/ ADVATE at 50 I U/kg VWF:RCo in random order. The primary endpoint was the tolerability and safety after single dose injections of rVWF: ADVATE at 2, 7.5, 20 ,and 50 I U/kg VWF:RCo for up to 30 day s after the last I P infusion. The data generated in this phase 1 study suggest that rVWF: ADVATE up to the highest investigated dose of 50 IU /kgVWF:RCo is well tolerated and safe in adults with severe VWD. No thrombogenic risk or TTP -like sy ndrome was observed, and no neutralizing antibodies to VWF or FVIII were identified. There were no deaths or other serious adverse reactions, and no infusions were interrupted or stopped due to an AE. For non-commercial use only"

Secondar y endpoints were the PK assessment of VWF:RCo, von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag )and multimeric composition of rVWF as well as FVIII:C at standardized time points after single injections o f rVWF: ADVATE and pdVWF:FVIII. The median VWF:RCo half-life ( T1/2)of rVWF at the 50 IU/kg dose was 16 hours. T1/2with pdVWF:FVIII at the same dose level appeared shorter at 12.58 hours , however, thelimits of the 90% CI were similar (11.73 to 17.7 hours vs. 11.87 to 18.03 h ours) . Themedian half -lives of VWF:RCo w ereshorter with the lower investigated doses: 7.13 hours and 13.23 hours with the 7.5 IU/kg and 20 IU/kg doses, although these data were derived f rom a much sm aller number of subjects. In consequence of the missing ADAMTS13 cleavage ,ultra-large molecular weight (ULMW) multimers are contained in the rVWF final product. The immediate cleavage of these ultra -large multimers by ADAMTS13 upon release in to the circulation could be demonstrated appl ying sodium dodecy l sulfate poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE )/Immunoblot with poly clonal an ti-VWF antibodies to detect the resulting rVWF subunit cleavage fragments. Overall t he data generated in thi s phase 1 study suggest that rVWF: ADVATE is well tolerated and safe in adults with severe VWD. 6.5.2.2 Study 071104 This study was a prospective, uncontrolled, non- randomized, multicenter proof of concept stud y to assess safet y and PK of the addition of rVWF to ADVATE treatment in 12 evaluable subjects with severe hemophilia A . All subjects underwent 3 PK analy ses: the first after infusion with ADVATE alone, the second after infusion with ADVATE plus 10 I U/kg rVWF and the third after infusion with ADVATE plus 50 IU/kg rVWF. The PK anal ysis was performed at intervals of approximately 8 to 14 day s. Before each infusion for PK assessment, there wasa wash -out period of at least 5 day s and the subjects were not actively bleeding. Primary outcome measures indicate that co -administration of rVWF slightly sustain ADVATE activity with the highest observed ADVATE half-life of 13.74 h (CI 11.44 to16.52) after co- infusion of 50 IU/ kg ADVATE plus 50 IU/kg rVWF :RCo .

No treatment related adverse events ( AEs) or serious adverse events ( SAE s)were reported . No subject withdrew due to an AE and there were no deaths. No binding antibodies to VWF, CHO ,and rFurin were detectable in the confirmatory assay and no signs of a h ypersensi ti vity to rVWF or ADVATE antigen were observed. Laboratory values over time did not indicate an y potential safety risk for hemophilia A patients treated with rVWF and ADVATE in combination. In summary , the data indicate that rVWF co-administered with ADVATE up to the highest dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo is well tolerated and safe in hemophilia A patients. 6.5.2.3 Study 071001 This was a phase 3, multicenter, open -label, part-randomized clinical study to assess the PK, saf ety,and efficacy of rVWF:rFVIII and rVWF in the treatment of bleeding episodes in adult subjects with severe t ype 3 and severe non -type 3 VWD .15A total of 49 subjects were enrolled (signed informed consent) and screened, 18 subjects were randomized (Arm 1 and Arm 2 [PK 50] only ), 37 subjects were treated with I P (all study arms) ,and 30subjects completed the study . The study consisted of 2 parts (Part A and Part B). Part A consisted of PK assessments alone (Arm 2: PK50 only [without treatment of bleeding episodes]), or PK assessments (Arm 1: PK50 and Arm 3: PK80) plus on -demand treatment period(s) of 6 months for bleeding episodes, or on- demand treatment for bleeding episodes only (Arm 4) . Subjects receiving treatment for PK assessments and/or bleeding episodes inPart A were to be entered into Part B to continue on- demand treatment for bleeding episodes for 6additional months for a total of 12 months in the study . The primary outcome measure was the number of subjects with “treatment success” (extent of control of bleeding episodes) , which was defined as a mean efficacy rating score of < 2.5 for a subject’s I P-treated bleeding episodes during the stud y.

FVIII levels increased substantially with a media n peak at 24 hours of 111.0 U/dL for rVWF:rFVIII and 86.0 U/dL after rVWF alone, indicating that rVWF induces a sustained increase in endogenous FVIII activity . The rVWF PK profile was comparable at 50 IU/kg and 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo, and repeated PK at 80 IU/k g VWF:RCo showed close agreement between pretreatment and end - of-study results. Further anal ysis of the PK data from the 071001 study supports the initial use of 50 IU/kg twice weekly for prophy laxis dosing in the present study for those subjects who are moving from on- demand to prophy laxis. Using 50 IU/kg for PK measurements, subjects in the 071001 study exhibiting a T1/2for rVWF of 14, 16 ,or 19 hours had BAX111 plasma concentrations at 72 hours after administration of 2.55, 4.01 ,and 6.49% above baseline, respectivel y, and plasma concentrations at 96 hours after administration of 0.78, 1.40, and 2.71% above baseline, respectivel y. Subjects who have significant spontaneous bleeding while on twice weekl yproph ylaxis will have their regimen increase dto 50IU/kg 3 times per week (see Section 8.7.4.2). A total of 125 AEs occurred in 25/37 (67.7%) subjects (62/318 infusions [19.5 %]) during or after infusion with I P. Of these, 116/125 were non -serious (all mild or moderate; none were severe), and 9 SAEs were reported in 7 subjects . Of 125 total AEs, 38 were temporally associated with I P; 8 AEs were considered causally related to I P: 6 non- serious related AEs (tach ycardia, infusion site paraesthesia, electrocardiogram [ECG ] t-wave inversion, dy sgeusia, generalized pruriti s, and hot flush) occurred in 4 subjects, and 2 related SAEs (chest discomfort and increased heart rate) occurred in 1subject. No deaths occurred during this study . None of the subjects developed anti -VWF or anti -FVIII neutralizing antibodies and no binding antibodies to VWF or rFurin, or antibodies against CHO protein or anti -Murine IgG were observed. No clinical o r subclinical signs or sy mptoms of a thrombogenic event were observed in this study . Following an initial increase in ultralarge VWF multimers after administration of rVWF, a notable decrease in the proportion of large VWF multimers occurred between 12 and 24 hours post infusion, due to degradation by the endogenous ADAMTS13 followed b y a continued decline until the end of the 96- hour follow -up period.

For t he initial rVWF infusion ,the subject receive d a test dose of 5% of the total dose of 60 IU/kg rVWF :RCo at an infusion rate of 1 mL/min. After a 1 0 to 15- minute observation period, no adverse s ymptoms or signs were noted and the subject received the remaining 95% of the total dose. The subject was monitored for an y signs of an allergic reaction, and none were noted .Treatment with rVWF every 12 to 2 4 hours was tocontinue at the discretion of the investigator based on VWF levels a nd clinical symptomatology . The subject had an excellent response and recovery , which allowed for daily dosing of rVWF and, within 24 hours, the subject’s bleeding had stopp ed. Dail y dosing of rVWF was maintained and the subject received his last dose on . The subject also received rVWF for 7 days for prophy laxis for surgery (surgical resection of a left -kidney mass). The subject experienced no hemorrhagic com plications and no AEs that were considered related to the use of rVWF. 6.6Evaluation of Anticipated Risks and Benefits of the Investigational Product(s) to Human Subjects Current treatment of VWD patients relies on desmopressin and VWF products manufactured f rom pooled human plasma. Human VWF produced b y recombinant technology could offer a new perspective in treatment of VWD. The benefit for the individual subject is anticipa ted to be significant during this clinical study . He/she may benefit from a product that minimizes excessive FVIII administration. Variations in VWF multimeric composition may lead to variabilit y with respect to treating or preventing bleeds in VWD subjects, especiall y mucosal bleeds which are especially problematic. rVWF product manufactu red b y Baxalta consistently contains ultra -large molecular weight (ULMW) VWF multimers due to the fact that the product has not been exposed to ADAMTS13. The initial presence of these ULMW VWF multimers, which are subsequently cleaved by the subject’s endo genous ADAMTS13, may result in improved platelet and collagen binding and therefore provide more p redictable treatment outcomes.

Subjects transitioning either from on -demand treatment or from prophy lactic treatment will be infused twice weekly with BAX 111 (rVWF) at doses of 50 ± 10 IU/kg rVWF:RCo. The dose may be adjusted within this range based on the PK data, subject’s history of bleeding episodes, and the results from clinical and laboratory assessments (see Section 8.7.4.2). The overall duration of prophy lactic treatment per subject will be 12months. During this period an y bleeding episodes requiring substitution therap y with VWF concentrate to control bleedin g will be treated with rVWF with or without ADVATE . The dose will be according to the bleeding severity and it will be adjusted to the clinical response (see Section 8.7.4.4.2 ).

If a subject experiences a bleeding episode requiring treatment during the PK assessment, rVWF will be used to treat the bleed. Blood draws for PK assessment will be stopped and the PK assessments will be repeated once the bleed has resolved and the subject is free of any symptoms related with the bleeding episode . Dose and frequency of rVWF infusions or an y other replacement therap y to stop the bleed shou ld be recorded in the e-CRF. 8.7.4.4.2 Dosing Recommendations for Treatment of Bleeding Episodes If an acute bleeding episode occurs ,the subject will be treated with rVWF with or without ADVATE . In general initially , an infusion of rVWF: ADVATE at anrVWF: ADVATE ratio of 1.3:1± 0.2will be administered. Subsequent infusion smay either use rVWF alone or with ADVATE, based on FVIII levels, if available. If FVIII levels are not available, dosing is at the discretion of the investigator based upon the individual subj ect’s PK data. Using ADVATE in addition to rVWF in subsequent doses carries the risk of an excessive rise in FVIII:C. Therefore, reduced doses of ADVATE and/or prolongation of the dose interval should be considered. In general the aim of the initial dose should be full replacement of VWF with VWF:RCo levels of >0 .6IU/ml (60%) and FVIII:C of > 0.4 IU/mL (40%). In major bleeding episodes ,subsequent doses should keep the trough level of VWF:RCo >50% for 3 day s and then as deemed necessary by the investigator for subsequent days. In moderate bleeding episodes, the dose and trough level may be reduced to >30% for as long as deemed necessary by the investigator. Treatment for minor bleeding episodes will generall y consist of onl y 1 or 2 doses of rVWF IP. If the VWF:RCo level is above 150%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 12 hours; if the VWF:RCo level is above 200%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 24 hours. In either case, a lower subsequent dose (e.g., 20 IU/kg VWF:RCo) may be appropriate. Dosing recommendations are listed in Table 3. For non-commercial use only"

In the phase 1 study 070701, 1 .0IU/kg VWF:RCo raised the circulating level of VWF:RCo by 0.017 IU/mL (1.7 %). In the same study , the o bserved mean half -life for rVWF was 19.3 hours, with a st andard deviation of 10.9 hours. Table 3 rVWF:RCo Dosing Recommendations for the Treatm ent of Bleeding Episodes due to VWD Classification of VWD Hem orrhage Dosage (IU VWF:RCo/kg body weight) Type 1 Severe (Baseline VWF:RCo activity typically <20%) Minor (e.g. ,epistaxis, oral bleeding, menorrhagia *) 40 to 50 IU/kg (1 or 2 doses) Major (e.g. ,severe or refractory epistaxis, menorrhagia *, GI bleeding, CNS trauma, hemarthrosis, or traumatic hemorrhage)Initial dose 50 to 75 IU/kg, then 40 to 60 IU/kg every 8 to 12 hours for 3 days to keep the trough level of VWF:RCo >50%; then 40 to 60 IU/kg daily for a tot al of up to 7 days of treatment Type 2 (all variants) and Type 3 Minor (clinical indications above) 40 to 50 IU/kg (1 or 2 doses) Major (clinical indications above)Initial dose of 60 to 80 IU/kg, then 40 to 60 IU/kg every 8 to 12 hours for 3 days to keep the trough level of VWF:RCo >50%; then 40 to 60 IU/kg daily for a total of up to 7 days of treatment * Menorrhagia is defined as excessive bleeding during menstruation. A diagnosis of menorrhagia will be defined by a prospectively completed Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) score >185 and normal cervical cytology or requiring use of a VWF -containing concentrate for treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding for at least one menstrual cycle during the prior year. Variances of up to 10% in dosing are permissible during treatment of bleeding episodes, but rounding to the nearest vial size should be avoided. Subjects with non- neutralizing binding anti -VWF antibodies should initially be treated with a dose known to be efficacious based on the subject’s medical treatment history whic h may differ from the recommendations provided in Table 3. Subjects should be monitored for lack of efficacy as well as for FVIII (mandatory ), VWF:RCo (mandatory ), and VWF:Ag (optional where testing is not available) levels after 3 to 6hours. Re -dosing with rVWF in combination with ADVATE using the same (initial) dose and adaptation of the dosing frequency should be considered until cessation of the ble ed, if the FVIII and/or VWF:RCo levels drop below 30% -50% depending on bleeding severit y. The number of subsequent infusions and the dosage levels prescribed will be determined by the investigator on the basis of the clinical severity , response to current therapy , available laboratory data, and the subject’s historical treatment for similar bleeding episode s.

For example, the third subject who signed an informed consent form at stud y site 02 will be ide ntified as Subject 090701 -020003. All study documents (e .g., CRFs, clinical documentation, sample containers, drug accountability logs, etc.) will be identified with the SI C. Additionally , a uniquely coded SI C(s) is permitted as long as it does not contain a combination of information that allows identification of a subject (e .g., collection of a subject’s initials and birth date would not be permitted), in compliance with laws governing data privacy . 10.3 Screening and Study Visits The study site is responsible for maintaining a screening log that includes all subjects who provided informed consent . The log also will serve to document the reason for screening failure. All screening data will be collected and reported in CRFs, regardless of screening outcome. If a subje ct is re -screened, the End of Study CRF should be completed, and a new ICF, new SIC and new CRF are required for that subject. The overall study design is illustrated in the Figure 1. Details on the procedures to be performed at each stud y visit, including screening, are provided in Supplement 20.2 Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments and Supplement 20.3 Clinical Laborato ry Assessments. 10.3.1 Scre ening V isit Written informed consent must be obtained from each subject before an y study related procedures are performed. To initiate screening procedures, at least 72 hours must have elapsed since the last VWF administration and the subject must not be activel y bleeding at the time of screening. Multimer analy sis and VWD gene mutation analy sis should be performed at screening if not available in the subject’s medical history .

If the I P is not infused within 42 days,allscreening assessments except blood group, human leucocy te antigen ( HLA ) , genetics , multimeric pattern and ,must be repeated to reconfirm eligibility . Refer to Supplement 20.2 and Supplement 20.3.Upon completion of screening procedures, subject eligibility will be confirmed by the sponsor on a subject eligibility form before additional study procedures are undertaken. The subject will maintain a diary that will include infusion logs (see Section 10.5). The allocation of IP will be initiated after the subject has qualified for home treatment (see Section 8.7.4.3.2). In the event ofa subject experienc inga bleeding episode that requires treatment between the screening visit and the baseline visit (PK assessment visit), the subject willbe treated with rVWF. If rVWF is not available for any reason , e.g., subject not yet trained on IP administration, study site visit for I P administration not feasible, etc ., the subject may use his/her standard of care, such as commercial pdVWF/FVIII products . 10.3.2 Baseline Vi sit -PK-Assessment V isit After screening and confirmation of eligibility each subject will undergo a PK assessmen t .Subjects who participated in the surgery study 071101 will not need to undergo a PK baseline assessment again if they had a major procedure performed, provided valid PK data from 071101 is available. These subjects may proceed directly with the prophy laxis initiation visit (refer to Section 10.3.3 ). All subjects will receive a dose of 50 ± 5 IU/kg rVWF:RCo to determine VWF and FVIII levels. Blood samples will be drawn within 30 minutes pre-infusion, and at 7 time points post -infusion (305minutes, 60 5 minutes, 6 1 hours, 12 1 hours, 24 2 hours, 48 2hours, 722hours) .Refer to Section 20.2 and Section 20.3. IP infusion vials from the same lot number should be used for all PK -assessments per subject . Samples for measurement of FVIII and VWF activity taken through to 6 hours post -infusion will be obtained from an extremity different from th at used for the infusion of I P. Where needed, the phlebotomy site will be kept patent via an infusion of normal saline. In this event, at least 5 mL of blood will be collected and discard ed before collection of the next test sample into a fresh syringe. For non-commercial use only"

Inthe ev ent that a blood sample must be drawn through the central line used for administration of I P, the line must first be flushed with at least 10 mL normal saline or other suitable catheter flush solution that does not contain anticoagulant. At least 5 mL of whole blood must be collected and discarded prior to obtaining the sample. If a subject experiences a bleeding episode during the PK assessment no subsequent blood sample will be drawn in that specific PK period. The guidance provided in Section 8.7.4.4 has to be followed for the treatment of the bleeding episode. The subject once recovered is eligible to repeat the PK assessment. 10.3.3 Prophylaxis Initiation V isit After the blood sample for the 72 hour PK assessment is drawn t he subject will receive the first rVWF proph ylactic dose of 50 ± 10 IU/kg rVWF: RCo. Details on dose are provided in Section 8.7.4.3 . If a subject did not undergo PK assessment (for example the subject has participated in the surgery study 071101 and has undergone PK in Study 071101 and had a major procedure performed , refer to Section 8.7.4.2 ), procedures and assessments at this visit include: adverse events, bleeding episodes, medications taken, non- drug therapies and laboratory assessment .Independent of previous PK assessment visits, w ithin 2 hours prior the IP infusion, a phy sical examination will be performed. Vital signs will be assessed within 30 minutes prior to I PrVWF infusion and 30 minute s ± 15 minutes after IP infusion.

W ithin 2 hours prior to the rVWF IP infusion ,a physical examination will be performed. Vital signs will be assessed within 30 minutes prior to IP infusion and 30minute s ± 15 minutes after IP infusion. Incremental recovery (IR) will be determined at each follow -up visit based on VWF:RCo activity assessed prior to and after I P infusion. The blood sample for IRanalysiswill be drawn within 30 minutes prior to IP infusion and 30 minutes ± 5 minutes after IPinfusion. rVWF will be infused at the regular prophy lactic dose, i.e.,50 ± 10 IU/kgrVWF:RCo. For each subject’s recovery anal ysis IP infusion ,vials from the same lot number should be used. Testing for VWF:RCo VWF:CB, rVWF:Ag , INNOVANCE VWF:Ac (exploratory )and FVIII:C level will be performed using the blood sample obtained before and after IP infusion. The blood sample prior to I P infusion will also be used for the assessment ofneutralizing and binding antibodies, clinical chemistry and hematology .A washout period of at least 72 hours after the last infusion applies before the blood draw for the immunogenicity assay s. Bleeding episodes andthe hemostatic efficacy will be evaluated based on the review of the patient diary . Refer to Section 20.2 and Section 20.3. The evaluation of I P consumption and t reatment compliance will be performed base d on subject’s diary entries. If a subject is not compliant with the prophy lactic treatment regimen and does not adhere to the required frequency ofadministration of IP infusions ( >30% of infusions were missed within a visit inter val [3months ] )the subject will be withdrawn from the study . At the 6 months ± 2 week visit an electrocardiogram ( ECG ) will be performed and data will be collected. For the hemostatic efficacy assessment the following information will be recorded b y the subject in the patient diary : bleeding location, ty pe, severit y, onset and resolution date and time, infusion date and time, clinical efficacy according to the rating scale.

Reasons for completion/discontinuation will be reported on the Completion/Disc ontinuation CRF, including: completed, screen failure, AE (e.g., death), discontinuation by subject (e .g., lost to follow - up [defined as 3 documented unsuccessful attempts to contact the subject], dropout), physician decision (e .g., pregnancy , progressive disease, non- compliance with IP/protocol violation(s), recovery), study terminated b y sponsor, or other (reason to be specified by the investigator, e .g., technical problems) . Regardless of the reason, all data available for the subject up to the time of completion/discontinuation should be recorded on the appropriate CRF. Every effort will be made to have discontinued subjects complete the study termination visit. If the termination visit is done as an additional, unscheduled visit, the assessment results shall be recorded with the termination visit. If a subject terminates participation in the study and does not return for t ermination visit, his/her last recorded assessments shall remain with thelast visit. The reason for discontinuation will be recorded, and the data collected up to the time of discontinuation will be used in the anal ysis and included in the clinical study report. Ifadditional assessments are required ,the assessment s shall be recorded separatel y. Assessments to be performed at the termination visit (including in cases of withdraw or discontinuation) can be found in Supplement 20.2 Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments and Supplement 20.3 Clinical L aboratory Assessments .

The following details on ble eding episodes will be recorded by the subject in the electronic diary (for home treatment), the subject’s healthcare provider in the site’s source documents (for treatments away from the p rimary investigative site), or by authorized, qualified personnel at the participating site in the subject’s medical records (for hospital -based treatment): Location of bleed; i.e.,joint, menorrhagia, epistaxis, gastrointestinal, soft tissue, muscle, body cavit y, intracranial, etc. Type of bleed; i.e.,spontaneous, trau matic, unknown Severity of bleed; i.e.,minor, moderate, and major (see Table 3) Date and time of onset of bleed Date and time of each infusion of rVWF or rVWF -ADVATE used to treat a bleeding episode Date and time of resolution of the bleeding episode Study site personnel are qualified after they have under gone training during the qualification of the site. All ty pes of bleeds, including traumatic bleeds, will be record ed. Bleeding episodes should be organized by where they occur in addition to whether they occurred spontaneously or due to a traumatic event . Bleeds occurring at the same anatomical location ( e.g., right knee) with the same etiology (i.e., spontaneous versu s injury ) within 24 hours after onset of the first bleed will be considered a single bleed. Bleeding occurring at multiple locations related to the same injury (e.g., knee and ankle bleeds following a fall) will be counted as a single bleeding episode. All efforts should be made to use rVWF for treatment of bleeding episodes. If needed , the use of a VWF concentrate other than IPfor the treatment of bleeding episodes will not disqualify the subject from further participation in the study . For non-commercial use only"

An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign ( e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom (e. g., rash, pain, discomfort, fever, dizziness, etc.) , disease (e.g., peritonitis, bacteremia, etc.),or outcome of death temporally associated with the use of an IP, whether or not considered causall y related to the I P. 12.1.1.1 Serious Adverse Event A nSAE is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose meets one or more of the following criteria: Outcome is fatal/res ults in death (including fetal death) Is life -threatening – defined as an event in which the subject was, in the judgment of the investigator, at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that h ypotheticall y might have caused de ath had it been more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization –inpatient hospitalization refers to any inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay . Results in persistent or significant disa bility /incapacity (i.e.,a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) Is acongenital anomal y/birth defect Is a medicall y important event –a medical event t hat may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or require hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definitions above. Examples of such events are: Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at hom e for allergic bronchospasm, blood d yscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependence or drug abuse Reviewed and confirmed seroconversion for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), or parvovirus B19 (B19V) For non-commercial use only"

However, when there is an increase in the severit y, duration, or frequency of a preexisting disease, the event must be described on the AE CRF. 12.1.2 Assessment of Adverse Events For the purposes of this study , the following will not be considered as AEs and will not be included in the analy sis of AEs. Bleeding episodes are part of the underl ying disease and therefore are not AEs; they will be evaluated in the context of efficacy . For non-serious bleeding episode scaused b y an injury, the injury would not be reported as an AE, unless it resulted in a medical finding other than a bleeding episode (e.g., abrasion of ski n). Therefore, any VWD - related bleeding event (e.g., epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, musculo -skeletal bleeding, menorrhagia) that is non -serious will not be reported as an AE. However, the investigator may decide that the event is an AE if the event also would have occurred in a healthy individual under the same circum stances. For SAEs: Bleeding events that meet seriousness criteria (death, life-threatening, hospitalizing/prolongation of hospitalization, disability , congenital anomal y, or medicall y significant and if not urgently treated would result in one of the above ) should be reported on the SAE eCRF or SAE Report form as a n SAE . Seroconversion after documented HAV/HBV vaccination prior to or during the study period. Each AE from the first IP exposure to the study completion date will be described on the AE CRF using the medical diagnosis (preferred), or, if no diagnosis could be established at the time of reporting the AE, a symptom or sign, in standard medical terminology in order to avoid the use of vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions (see definition in Section 12.1). Each AE will be evaluated b y the investigator for: Seriousness as defined in Section 12.1.1.1 Severity as defined in Section 12.1.2.1 Causal relationship to I P exposure or study procedure as defined in Section 12.1.2.2 For non-commercial use only"

Recovering/resolving AEs will be followed until re solution . If the severity rating for an ongoing AE changes before the event resolves, the original AE report will be revised (i.e., the event will not be reported as separate AE). During the course of an y AE, the highest severit y rating will be reported. Deviations from the protocol -specified dosage (including underdosing /overdosi ng [<20 IU/kg rVWF:RCo or > 100rVWF:RCo], abuse, and withdrawal, treatment errors (including incorrect route of administration, use of an incorrect product, and deviations from the protocol -defined dosing schedule), failures of expected pharmacological actions, and unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefits will be followed with regard tooccurrence of AEs, lack of efficacy , and/or other observations because these events may be reportable to regulatory authorities. Any pregnancy that occurs after administration of IP will be reported on a Pregnancy Form and followed- up at 1 y ear post- delivery , if feasible. If an investigator becomes aware of an SAE occurring in a subject after study completion, the SAE must be reported on the SAE Form within 24 hours after awareness: no additional reporting on CRFs is necessary . 12.1.2.1 Severity The investigator will assess the sever ity of each AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment based on the most appropriate description below: Mild The AE is a transient discomfort and does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject’s normal functioning level. The AE resolves spontaneously or may require minimal therapeutic intervention. Moderate The AE produces limited impairment of function and may require therapeutic intervention. The AE produces no sequela/sequelae.

These severity definitions will also be used to assess the severity of an AE with a study- related procedu re(s), if necessary . 12.1.2.2 Causality Causality is a determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the I P is etiologicall y related to/associated with the AE. Causality assessment includes, e .g., assessment of temporal relationships, dechallenge/ rechallenge information, association (or lack of association) with underly ing disease, presence (or absence) of a more likely cause, and ph ysiological plausibility .For each AE, the investigator will assess the causal relationship between the IP and the AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment according to the following most appropriate algorithm for the circumstances of the AE: Not related (both circumstances must be met) Is due to underl ying or concurrent illness, complications, concurrent treatme nts, or effects of concurrent drugs Is not associated with the I P (i.e., does not follow a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of I P or has a much more likel y alternative etiology ). Unlikely related (either 1 or both circumstances are m et) Has little or no temporal relationship to the I P A more likely alternative etiology exists Possibly related (both circumstances must be met) Follows a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of I P An alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the potential relationship to the I P Probably related (both circumstances must be met) Follows a strong temporal relationship to the administration of I P, which may include but is not limited to the following: For non-commercial use only"

These causality definitions will also be used to assess the relationship of an AE with a study - related procedure(s), if necessary. 12.1.2.3 Safety Reporting Adverse events/SAEs will be assessed at all study visits as outlined in the Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments (see Table 5) and Section 12.1.2. Adverse Events/SAEs are to be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. Each event should be recorded separatel y. Any SAE, including death due to any cause, which occurs during this study , whether or not related to the investigational product, must be reported immediatel y (within 24 hours of the study center’s firstknowledge of the event). All SAEs must be reported via the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) s ystem by completing the relevant eCRF page(s) in English. For instances in which the EDC may become unavailable, SAEs must be reported using the back -up paper SAE re port (SAER) form to meet the 24- hour timeline requirement (for contacts an d instructions refer to the SAER form ). Once the EDC becomes available, the site must enter all SAE data as re ported on the back -up paper SAER form on the applicable eCRF pages.

However, the same method should be used for all measurements in 1 subject. Vital signs (pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure) should be recorded within 30 min before and after IP administration. The assessment of vital signs per planned study visit is outlined in Supplement 20.2. Vital sign values are to be recorded on the ph ysical examination eCRF. For each vital sign value, the investigator will dete rmine whether the value is considered an AE (see definition in Section 12.1). If assessed as an AE, the medical diagnosis (preferabl y), symptom, or sign, will be recorded on the AE eCRF. Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or etiology of an abnormal result, or to monitor the course of an AE, should be obtained when clinicall y indicated.

Testing will be done prior to I P infusion and with at least a 72hour wash out period since the last I P infusion. If there is any suspicion of inhibitor development (e.g. excessive bleeding) binding and neutralizing antibodies to VWF and FVIII may be tested at the discretion of the investigator. 12.9.3.2 Neutralizing and Total Binding Anti -VWF Antibodies The assay s to establish the presence of neutralizing and total binding anti -VWF antibodies have b een established in the absence of international standards and with only limited numbers of positive controls. Therefore ,caution is advised in interpreting positive results. In particular ,any clinical association, changes in the natural history of the disease, effect of therap y, etc. needs to be taken into account for final judgment. Thesponsor ’s Medical Director should be consulted for additional advice. As part of the AE follow -up, an y sample testing positive needs to be confirmed after 2 -4 weeks for central lab oratory testing. Only confirmed neutralizing anti -VWF antibodies are considered inhibitors (see Section 12.9.3.4) . These subjects need to be closely monitored and therap y adjusted accordingl y. 12.9.3.3 Binding antibodies to VWF The presence of total binding anti -VWF antibodies will be determined by an enzy me- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) employ ing poly clonal anti -human Immunoglobulin (Ig)antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA). For this assay (ELI SA), recombinant human VWF will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then incubated with dilutions of the positive control , the negative control or test sample. Antibodies against human VWF that are present in the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -coupled goat anti- human antibody (secondary antibody ). The positive control for this assay will be a human monoclonal antibody specific for human VWF spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human plasma. Plasma samples are analy zed for binding antibodies against the specific antig en in two steps. First, the sample is screened for antibodies and the titer of binding antibodies is determined. Second, the specificit y of positive antibody results is confirmed.16 Inbrief, all samples are serially diluted (initial dilution 1:20 and further diluted 1:2). For non-commercial use only"

The cut off level is established based on background signal level of healthy plasma donors (n=160) and set to include 5% false positives to be as sensitive as possible (95% percentile). The ELISA assay is validated allowing a nassay variability of ± 1 titer step. Therefore, differences ≤ 2 titers steps may be due to variability of the ELISA assay. Specificity has to be confirmed in a competition assay when a sample has a titer of 1:80 or higher in the screening assay . Based on the validation criteria samples tested in the screening assay at 1:20 or 1:40 cannot be confirmed in the competition assay . A positive screening value is confirmed if the difference between the titers determined for the subject sample (re -screen) and for t he subject sample with pre -incubation (confirmation sample) is > 2 titer steps. Antibody titers of subject samples will only be reported as positive, if the results of the screening and confirmatory anal ysis fulfill these acceptance criteria. The titer to be reported is alway s the one determined in the original screening procedure (independent of the result of the re -screening in the confirmation procedure). A more detailed test procedure will be supplied upon request or pro -actively if a sample tests posi tive. A treatment related increase of the binding anti -VWF antibodies is expected, if the titer increases by more than 2 titration steps. These subjects need to be closely monitored and therapy adjusted accordingly . 12.9.3.4 Neutralizing antibodies to VWF Three fun ctional VWF assays, collagen binding (VWF:CB) assay , Ristocetin cofactor (VWF:RCo) and FVIII binding (VWF:FVIIIB), will be used to test for the presence of neutralizing anti-VWF antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies to VWF:RCo, VWF:CB and VWF:FVIIIB activiti es will be measured b y assay s based on the Bethesda assay established for quantitative anal ysis of FVIII inhibitors (Nijmegen modification of the Bethes da assay ).17The amount of inhibitor is expressed as Bethesda units (BU) per mL. One BU is thereb y defined as the amount of inhibitor that decreases the measured activity in the assay s to 50% of that of the negative control samples. The assay s were validated using human plasma samples from two ty pe 3 VWD patients with low (1 -2 BU/mL) and high (~ 10BU/mL) titer inhibitors and plasma samples from non -human primates immunized with human rVWF (>100 BU/mL) If a subject has a measurable baseline level of VWF activity in the respective assay , it is taken into account in the calculation of the residual activity . However, if baseline levels are to ohigh (>15% VWF:RCo), inhibitors may not be reliabl ydetected. For non-commercial use only"

The rationale for this cut -off value is the relativel y high CIof the underl ying assay s,making determinations at the end of the evaluation range of the Bethesda reference curve uncer tain.18 A more detailed test procedure may be requested to further characterize the anti -VWF inhibitors, if detected. 12.9.3.5 Binding Antibod ies to FVIII Binding antibodies against FVIII will be anal yzedusing a proprietary enzyme immunoassay . The testing strategy will be as described for binding anti -VWF antibodies. Antibody -containing samples will be identified in a screening assay followed b y a confirmatory assay to exclude false positive results. 12.9.3.6 Neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to FVIII Neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to FVIII will be assessed b y the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay in a central laboratory . To verify a FVIII inhibitor, additional testing (such as tests for L upus anticoagulants) may be initiated. Positive F VIII inhibitor tests will be defined as ≥ 0.4 BU b y the Nijmegen -modified Bethesda assay that is confirmed b y a second test performed on an independent sample obtained 2- 4 weeks following the first test. Only confirmed positive FVIII inhibitor test result will be reported as an SAE. 12.9.4 Antibodies to Other Proteins Plasma will be assay ed for the presence of antibodies against CHO protein (total Ig), murine IgG and human Furin (total Ig) using proprietary enzy me immunoassay s. The testing strategy will be as desc ribed for binding anti -VWF antibodies. Antibody -containing samples will be identified in a screening assay followed by a confirmatory assay to exclude false positive results. 12.9.4.1 Anti -CHO Protein Total Ig antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM) against CHO protein will be anal yzed. For this assay (ELISA), CHO protein derived from cultures of untransfected cells and propagated under the identical cell culture conditions used for ADVATE production will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then incubated with dilutions of the positive control, negative control or test sample. Antibodies against CHO protein that are present in the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a horseradish peroxidase (H RP)-coupled goat anti-human antibody (secondary antibody ).

M icrotiter plates coated with mouseIgG will be incubated with dilutions of the standard, the positive control, the negative control or the test sample. Antibodies against mouse IgG that are present in thesamples bind to the coated antigen and form a bridge to a peroxidase coupled mouse IgGantibody that will be used for detection (bridging format of the ELISA assay ). Thepositive control for this assay will be a poly clonal goat anti-murine IgG spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human pl asma. 12.9.4.3 Antibodies to human Furin Total Ig antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM) against human Furin will be anal yzed. For this assay (ELISA), recombinant human Furin will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then incubated with dilutions of the positive control, the neg ative control or test sample. Antibodies against human Furin that are present in the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled goat anti- human antibody (secondary antibody ). The positive control for this assay will be a human monoclonal antibody specific for human Furin spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human plasma. 12.9.5 Viral Serology The following vir al seromarkers will be assessed at screening: HIV:anti-HIV 1, HIV 2 HAV: anti -HAV (IgG and immunoglobulin M [IgM]) HBV: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg ), anti -Hepatitis B ( HB)core, anti -HBs HCV: anti -HCV ELI SA Parvovirus B19: anti -B19V (IgG and IgM) Virus serology will be established during the screening period .

If no urine sample is available, the pregnancy testing will be done from serum. The pregnancy test may need to be repeated during the course of study in countries where mandated b y national law. 12.9.8 VWD Mutational Analysis , Multimer Analysis and Human Leukocyte Antigen Genotyping A cell pellet (buffy coat and ery throcy tes) will be retained at the screening visit for VWD gene mutational analy sis,VWF multimer analy sis and HLA genot ype determination if the information is not already available in the subject’s medical history . Results from multimer analy sis(see Section 12.9.10.1 )may contribute to VWD gene mutation al analysis. The genetic testing will be done, when the subject consents to the genetic testing. 12.9.9 Blood Group Analysis Theblood group needs to be determined during the screening period . If the information is not alread y available in the subject’s medical history , it has to be determined at the local lab. 12.9.10 Additional Laboratory T esting in case of Thrombo embolic Events rVWF contains ultra large molecular weight (ULMW) multimers because of a lack of exposure to endogenous VWF protease ( a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin ty pe 1 motif, member 13 ( ADA MTS13) during the manufacturing process. In vitro and in vivo cleavage of these ultralarge molecular fractions by ADAMTS13 and generation of characteristic satellite bands has been extensively demonstrated during nonclinical and clinical development. Never theless, the potential elevated risk of thrombosis and/or other thromboembolic complications due to the administration of ultra large molecular VWF multimers in subjects with normal levels of VWF cannot be completely excluded. Therefore VWF multimer analy sis will not only be performed routinel y at screening but i n case of t hrombo embolic events both VWF multimer analy sis as well as ADAMTS13 activit y will be determined to assess an y relatedness of these occurrences with I P treatment.

High -resolution SDS –agarose gel electrophoresis, with agarose concentrations 1.5%, will be used to determine the satellite band struct ure of VWF. These anal yses will employ Western blot with luminescence video imaging. 12.9.10.2 ADAMTS13 activity VWF73 was identified as the 73 amino acid minimal region of the VWF A2 domain required for ADAMTS13 cleavage. The cleavage of this substrate will be det ected b y a commerciall y available ELISA -based Chromogenic assay (Technoclone Austria): Cleavage of immobilized VWF73 substrate is detected b y a HRP -labeled antibody directed against the cleavage site of VWF73. The amount of bound antibody, which is the function of the ADAMTS13 cleavage is detected by a chromogenic substrate . 12.9.11 Soluble P -Selectin (sP -Selectin) sP-selectin is a cell adhesion molecule (CAM) found in granules in endothelial cells (cells lining blood vessels) and activated platelets. Data for an a ssociation between the sP-selectin concentration, thrombotic thrombocy topenic purpura (TTP)and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are limited and the predictive value has not yet established. Acommercial ELISA assay will be employ ed as an exploratory test. sP-selectin will be determined at the Screening visit and used as indicator for an increased thrombotic risk. 12.9.12 D- Dimer D-dimer will be used as a marker for DVT and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) . While a negative result practically rules out thrombosis, a positive result can indicate thrombosis but does not rule out other potential etiologies, including a recent hemorrhage. Its main use, therefore, is to exclude thromboembolic disease where the probability is low. D-Dimer will be measured at t he Screening visit and used as indicator for an increased thrombotic risk. 12.9.13 Additional Laboratory Testing in C ase of Severe Hypersensitivity R eactions If a subject develops a severe hypersensitivity reaction in the course of the clinical study , additional blood dr aws for anti-VWF IgE antibody testing will be drawn. The presence of anti-VWF IgE will be determined by using the ImmunoCAP®, a VWF -specific IgE blood test (Thermo Scientific). The basis of the ImmunoCAP® technology is a cellulose polymer as solid phase in a plastic capsule providing a large surface for protein binding. rVWF as antigen is covalently coupled to the cellulose poly mer.

Summary tables shall indicate the number of subjects who experienced adverse events. Separate tables will be carried out for temporall y associated adverse events; and for temporally associated or causall y related adverse events. In addition, tables will be prepared to list each AE, the number of subjects who experienced an AE at least once, and the rate of subjects with AE(s). AEs will be grouped by system organ class. Each event will then be divided into defined severity grades (mild, moderate, severe). The tables will also divide the AEs into those considered related (a “possibly related” or a “probably related” AE will be considered as a “related AE”) to the treatment and those considered unrelated (an “unlikely related” or a “not related” AE will be considered as an “unrelated” AE). These tables will also be carried out for temporall y associated adverse events; and for temporall y associated or causall y related adverse events. All AEs; temporal ly associated AEs; causally related AEs (by investigator assessment) ; andtemporall y associated or causall y related AEs will also be summarized by system organ class, preferred term, including the number of AEs, the number (%) of unique subjects, the frequ ency category (very common: ≥10%, common: ≥1% to <10%, uncommon: ≥0.1% to <1%, rare: ≥0.01% to <0.1%, very rare: <0.01%) and the number of IP-infusions associated with an AE. Temporall y associated AEs are defined as AEs that begin during infusion or within 24hours (or 1 day where time of onset is not available) after completion of infusion, irrespective of being related or not related to treatment. AEs and SAEs for each subject, including the same event on several occasions, will be listed separatel y, giving both MedDRA preferred term and the original verbatim term used by the investigator, sy stem organ class, severity grade, seriousness, relation to the treatment (by investigator assessment; for SAEs this will be by investigator and sponsor assessmen t), onset date, and stop date.

The sample size of a subset of at least 15 subjects w ith severe VWD, 5 of whom must have Type 3 VWD, is based on the Guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Human Plasma Derived von Willebrand Factor Products (CPMP/BPWG/220/02).1 Planned Statistical Analysis Primary Outcome Measure: The statistical analysis will provide descriptive summaries . The prospectively recorded annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of spontaneous (not related to trauma) bleeding episodes during prophylactic treatment will be assessed using negative binomial distribu tion. Mean ABR of spontaneous bleeding episodes together w ith the corresponding 9 5% two -sided confidence intervals (CIs) will be reported for the prospective counts as well as those based on historical data . Secondary Outcome Measures: Efficacy: For the number of infusions and for the total weight adjusted consumption of rVWF and ADVATE per month and per year during on -demand treatment for bleeding episodes , summary statistics w ill be carried out. For the number (proportion) of subjects w ith reduction of ABR relative to historic ABR as well as for the number (proportion) of subjects with 0 bleeds, proportions and corresponding 9 5% two-sided CIswill be performed. The cause, type, localization and severity of bleeding episodes will also be recorded and summarized. For non-commercial use only"

BACKGROUND INFORMATIO N 6.1 Description of Investigational Product Baxalta US Inc. (herea fter referred to as Baxalta or sponsor) has developed a human recombinant von Willebrand Factor (rVWF), which is co-expressed with r ecombinant factor VIII (r FVIII )in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line andsepar ated during the subsequent downstream process. To address concerns regarding the risk of transmission of blood- bornepathogens that may be introduced by human plasma, no exogenousl y added raw materials of human or animal origin are employ ed in the cell culture, purification, or form ulation of the final container product. The onl y proteins present in the final container product other than rVWF are trace quantities of murine immunoglobulin (IgG, from the immunoaffinity purification), host cell (i.e. , CHO) protein, rFurin (used to furth er process rVW F). rVWF is intended for the treatment of von Willebrand disease (VWD). rVWF has been developed under the Baxalta internal code BAX111 and is used as investigational product (IP) in this study . rVWF may be used with or without ADVATE (rFV III)for the treatment of bleeding episodes (see Section 8.7.4.4). See Section 8.7for further information on the I Ps and their usage in this study . A detailed description of rVWF is also provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) . rVWF was granted licensure in the United States in Dec ember 2015 under the brand name VONVENDI for the on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes in adults diagnosed with VWD ; as of the date of this protocol VONVENDI is not y et available on the market. 6.2Clinical Condition/Indication Von Willebrand Factor (VWF )is a large multimeric gl ycoprotein with a molecular weight that varies from 500 to 20,000 kDa. VWF is normally found in plasma and produced in the alpha -granules of platelets and in endothelial cell organelles known as the Weibel - Palade bodies. VWF mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular injury , one of the key functions in primary hemostasis. VWF also serves to stabilize coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), where FVIII is an essential cofactor of secondary hemostasis, which leads t o fibrin clot formation.2Qualitative and/or quantitative deficiencies of VWF lead to a highl y variable bleeding diathesis known as VWD, the most common of the hereditary coagulation factor deficiencies. Penetrance of VWD is highly variable, with only a small fraction of mildly affected patients display ing clinical sy mptoms or a family history of a bleeding diathesis. For non-commercial use only"
231,page_231,"rVWF Page 21of 105 Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: 071301 2016 DEC 1 5 BAX ALTA CONFIDENTIAL – RESTRICTED: DO NOT D ISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PR IOR APPROVALThe current biochemical -based classification distinguishes disorders arising from partial quantitative (type 1), qualitative (ty pe 2), or virtually complete (t ype 3) deficiencies of VWF. Up to 70% of VWD patients are diagnosed with ty pe 1 VWD, which may also be associated with minor functional defects in the molecule. In general, patients with ty pe 1 VWD di splay mild clinical sy mptoms. Approximately 20 to 30% of VWD patients are diagnosed with ty pe 2 VWD. Ty pe 2 VWD is further divided into 4 subty pes (A, B, N, and M), reflecting distinct classes of functional abnormalities. These defects result in abnormal f unctional and/or multimeric distribution patterns that facilitate their diagnosis. The bleeding diathesis is usually moderate and primarily affects the mucosal tissues. Type 2N VWD patients are sometimes misdiagnosed as mild hemophilia A. Finally , approxim ately 1% percent of VWD patients exhibit a total or near total absence of VWF, which is classified as t ype 3 VWD. The incidence of ty pe 3 VWD is estimated at 0.5-1.0 x 106. This ty pe is also associated with a ve ry low FVIII level (t ypically <5%) because th e VWF carrier function for FVIII is lost. Replacement of VWF alone stabilizes endogenous FVIII, resulting in hemostatic levels withi n several hours post -infusion. Published results from studies of a plasma -derived VWF concentrate demonstrated an increase of FVIII at an approximate rate of 5.8 1 IU dL-1h-1.3Type 3 VWD patients display severe hemorrhagic s ymptoms with bleeding predominantl y in mucosal tissues, muscle and joints. All VWD patients, particularl y those with ty pe 2 or t ype 3 VWD, are at an increased risk for life -threatening bleeding episodes. 6.3The Role of Prophylaxis in the M anagement of VWD The goals of long term prophy laxis in VWD are to maintain VWF and FVIII at sufficient levels to reduce the frequency and duration of bleeding episodes, the need for red blood cell transfusions, and the risk of complications, such as arthropath y.4In contrast to hemophilia ,routine prophy laxis is not as established in VWD , although prophy laxis for patients with severe VWD have alread y been in use in Sweden during the 1950s .5In those earl y days of VWD treatment plasma FVIII concentrates containing VWF fractions were applied for replacement therap y ,which then were followed b y plasma derived VWF products containing fractions of FVIII (pdVWF/FVIII). A Swedish cohort inc luding 37 patients with t ype 3 VWD under proph ylactic median treatment of 11 years (range 2 to 45 years) was retrospectivel y anal yzed.6;7The doses used for proph ylaxis,given once weekly for at least 45 weeks per y ear, were calculated based on 12 to 50 IU/ kgbody weight (BW)of FVIII clotting activity (FVIII:C ) which approxim ately corresponded to 24 -100 IU/kg von Willebrand factor: Ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:R Co)considering that mainly Haemate with a known VWF:RCo/FVIII:C ratio of about 2 was used. An escalation of doses from 1to 3dose levels was allowed depending on the frequency and severit y of bleeding episodes . For non-commercial use only"

Whereas the median value f or bleeds per year was about 10 before prophy laxis this value could be reduced to less than 1 bleed per year during prophy laxis. The benefit of proph ylaxis for such indications was retrospectivel y also demonstrated in a cohort of Italian patients including type 3, 2A, 2M and ty pe 1 patients. Prophy laxis was started after sever egastrointestinal or joint bleeding episodes and completely prevented bleeding episodes in 8 of these 11 patients and largely reduced the need of blood transfusions in the remaining 3. A regimen of 40 IU rVWF:RCo/kg was applied every other day or twice a week. A prospective study on prophy laxis, the PRO.WILL study , has been initiated in I taly.8 The results of a prospective study investigating the prophy laxis inchildren and young adults showed a significantly reduced bleeding frequency and bleeding score ( 3vs. 0.07; 3 vs. 0. p<0.001) compared to the pre- prophy laxis values. The median dose was 40(20-47) IU /kgVWF:RCo administered mainly twice weekly in 23 patients , 3 times a week in 7 patients and 4times a week in 2 children .9 The VWD Prophy laxis Network initiated the VWD Intern ational Proph ylaxis (VI P) trial to investigate the role of prophy laxis in patients with s evere VWD including Ty pe 1, 2 , and3. The dose of the factor replaceme nt product was 50 IU /kgVWF:RCo. The frequency of the dose depended on the t ype of bleeding and could be increased from once weekl y to twice weekl y or3times per week. For the treatment of men orrhagia the dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo was given on the first day of menses for 2 cy cles. The f requency could be increased to D ay 1 and 2 for 2 cy cles or to Day 1, 2, and 3 of menses . The study contains both retrospective and prospective study components. Results from theretrospective study component were published, including 61 subjects on prophy lactic regimen in the past 6 months prior to enrollment or subjects with a history of prophy laxis over at least 6 month .10Differences in annualized bleeding rates (ABR) within individuals (during prophylaxis – before proph ylaxis) were significant for those with primary indications of epistaxis (P = 0.0005), joint bleeding (P = 0.002) and gastrointestinal ( GI)bleeding (P = 0.001). The difference in the group whose primary indication for treatment was abnormall y heav y bleeding at menstruation (n = 4) was not significant (P = 0.25). The reduction of mucosal bleeding likely not onl y dependen t s on normal circulating levels of active VWF, but also on the presence of discrete concentrations of normal VWF inside the platelets and within endothelial matrices. The low subject number (n=4) and the treatment scheme for menorrhagia on Days 1, 2, and 3 of menses which might represent rather on- demand than proph ylactic treatment may also account for the outcome in this study .

Sixsubjects presented with epistaxis, 3 with GI bleeding, and 2with joint bleeding. Seven subjects had dose escalation above the first level. Among the 10 subjects with evaluable bleeding log data, the use of prophy laxis decreased the median ABR from 25 to 6.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] of the rate difference: -51.6 to - 1.7), and the median ABR was even lower (4.0; 95% CI : -57.5 to - 5.3) when the subjects reached their final dosing level. The authors concluded that this was the first prospective study to demonstrate that proph ylaxis with VWF concentrates is highl y effective in reducing mucosal and joint bleeding rates in clinicall y severe VWD. The results of the VI P study and previous investigations suggest that VWD patients with recurrent bleeding episodes and severe menorrhagia will benefit from a proph ylactic VWF replacement therapy . There is evidence that up to 40% of patients with ty pe 3 VWD experience joint bleeding which can lead to h emophilic arthropath y. Other potential indications for prophy laxis include patients with ty pe 2A or 2B VWD with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, menorrhagia or frequent epistaxis .4Long-term prophy laxis for most patients with ty pe 3 VWD and in some patients with ty pe 1 or 2 VWD, depending on the pattern of bleeding, may be the treatment option of choice . Although the main experience with long -term prophy laxis is with secondary prophy laxis, primary proph ylaxis starting at young age is recommended to prevent art hropathy in patients with severe V WD.12 However, further studies are needed to develop evidence -based guidelines for prophy lactic treatment in VWD. 6.4Population to b e Studied A total of approximately 18eligible , adult subjects to achieve approximately 15 evaluable subjects with severe VWD are planned to be enrolled, of which a subset of at least 5subjects will have ty pe 3 VWD.

For additional information on nonclinical and clinical Phase 1 re sults refer to the rVWF IB. 6.5.1 Findings from Nonclinical Studies 6.5.1.1 Primary Pharmacodynamics Efficacy of rVWF combined with ADVATE was shown in VWD animal models, which have also low endogenous FVIII levels. Time to occlusion and stable th rombus formation was assessed in the carotid occlusion m odel in VWD mice. The results demonstrated that rVWF in combination with ADVATE acted efficiently in a dose -depend ent manner and had higher efficacy than rVWF alone or plasma derived ( pd)VWF. These results were confirmed in an additional study assessing blood loss and survival in a tail tip bleeding model in VW D mice . In a VWD dog rVWF stabilized canine FVIII in the circulation and significantl y reduced the bleeding time. 6.5.1.2 Safety Pharmacology The anaph ylactoid and thrombog enic potential of the co -infusion of ADVATE and rVWF and the co- infused product’s effects on blood pressure, cardiac and respiratory function and parameters of coagulation activation were investigated in 4in vivo studies in different animal models. Safety pharma cology studies in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits ,and dogs revealed no risks for anaph ylactoid and thrombogenic potential of ADVATE in combination with rVWF. All observations in safety pharmacology studies are considered to lie within the biologic al variability of animal models or occurred due to known species -specific anaphy lactoid effects of excipients . 6.5.1.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies of both rVWF alone and combined with human rFVIII (rVWF+ ADVATE ) were conducted in VWD mice, VWD dogs, VW D pigs, rats ,and cynomolgus monkey s. Human rVWF stabilized the endogenous FVIII in VWD mice, VWD pigs , and VWD dogs. Furthermore, the h ypotheses that the area under the curve (AUC )with rVWF alone and rVWF+ ADVATE is not inferior to the AUC with pdVWF (Haemate P) was tested and confirmed statistically in normal rats. The pharmacokinetic ( PK)characteristics of ADVATE were not affected b y co-administration of rVWF in cy nomolgus monkey s. The PK data in the FVIII knock out (k.o.)mice model are inconclusive an d might not be relevant for the clinical situation. However, a stabilizing effect of VWF on FVIII could be shown in a double knock out model in a dose depend ent manner. For non-commercial use only"

Rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkey s showed no signs of toxicity . Signs of microthrombosis, an exaggerated pharmacological effect, were observed in mice. Mice are not capable of sufficiently cleaving the rVWF subunit as murine disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombo spondin ty pe 1 motif, number 13 (ADAMTS13 )does not decrease the ultra -large molecular weight multimers of rVWF .13 The observed s ymptoms of microthrombosis are interpreted as a species -specific exaggerated pharmacologic al effect. Studies evaluating the safet y of repeated administration of rVWF with or without ADVATE (daily over 14 day s) were performed in a rodent (rat) and non -rodent (cy nomolgus monkey ) species. Reversible signs of exaggerated pharmacological effects (re generative anemia, thrombocy topenia, and treatment -related histopathologic changes in the heart, liver, and spleen) were observed in rats that were administered 1400 U VWF:RCo/kg /day + 1080 IU ADVATE /kg/day intravenously once daily for 14 day s. Also, thes e findings are interpreted as a species -specific exaggerated pharmacological effect due to the low susceptibility of human rVWF to cleavage by rodent ADAMTS13.13Notoxicologicall y relevant changes were evident for clinical observations, body weight, feed consumption, ophthalmology , urinaly sis, coagulation, and serum chemistry parameters, platelet aggregation, and gross pathology .rVWF combined with ADVATE was well tolerated in cy nomolgus monkey s after daily intravenous ( i.v.) (bolus) administration of 100 U VWF:RCo/kg rVWF combined with 77 IU/kg ADVATE over a period of 14 day s. No adverse effects could be detected in this species. There were no signs of hemoly sis, thrombosis ,or thrombocytopenia after repeated intravenous application of rVWF with or without ADVATE . Therefore , 100 UVWF:RCo/kg/day rVWF with or without 77 IU/kg ADVATE was considered the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL )inthis study , which was the highest dose tested. Anti- drug antibodies, however, were formed in both species and resulted in a significant reduction in drug exposure after 14 applications as compared to a single application. These antibodies substantially reduced the sy stemic exposure to the test substance as compared to a single dose administration. No adverse effects due to anti body formation were observed in both species. rVWF combined with ADVATE was well tolerated locall y and no genotoxic potential was evident after 2 in vitro and 1 in vivo genotoxicity study .A study on the influence of co-administration of VWF and ADVATE on the immunogenicit y of ADVATE in 3 different hemophilic mouse models (E17 hemophilic Balb/c mice, E17 hemophilic C57BL /6J mice ,and E17 hemophilic human F8 transgenic mice) showed that rVWF does not negatively impact the immunogenicit y of ADVATE in an y of t he three different hemophilic mouse models.

Details on study design, populations enrolled, and safety and efficacy outcomes of these 2 phase 1 studies are presented in Section 6.5.2.1 andSection 6.5.2.2, and the phase 3 stud y in Section 6.5.2.3 .Information on a single subject with VWD in Study 071401 is presented in Section 6.5.2.4. Refer to rVWF IB for periodic updates from other rVWF studies. 6.5.2.1 Study 070701 Phase 1 clinical study 070701 was a multicenter, controlled, randomized, single -blind , prospective 3 -step, dose escalation study to investigate safet y, tolerability ,and PK of rVWF combined at a fixed ratio with ADVATE (VWF:RCo/FVIII:C of 1.3 ± 0.2:1) in adults with severe VWD .14Subjects were enrolled in sequential cohorts in a dose escalating manner: Cohort 1, 2 , and 3 received a single intravenous infusion of rVWF: ADVATE at the following doses: 2 IU/kg VWF:RCo (Cohort 1), 7.5 IU/kg VWF:RCo (Cohort 2), and 20 IU/kg VWF:RCo (Cohort 3). Subjects in Cohort 4 received a single intravenous infusion of rVWF:ADVATE and pdVWF/ ADVATE at 50 I U/kg VWF:RCo in random order. The primary endpoint was the tolerability and safety after single dose injections of rVWF: ADVATE at 2, 7.5, 20 ,and 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo for up to 30 day s after the last I P infusion. The data generated in this phase 1 study suggest that rVWF: ADVATE up to the highest investigated dose of 50 IU /kgVWF:RCo is well tolerated and safe in adults with severe VWD. No thrombogenic risk or TTP -like sy ndrome was observed, and no neutralizing antibodies to VWF or FVIII were identified . There were no deaths or other serious adverse reactions, and no infusions were interrupted or stopped due to an AE. Overall, the reported AE profile was similar between the recombinant and plasma -derived concentrates. Secondar y endpoints were the PK asse ssment of VWF:RCo, von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag )and multimeric composition of rVWF as well as FVIII:C at standardized time points after single injections o f rVWF: ADVATE and pdVWF:FVIII. The median VWF:RCo half -life (T 1/2)of rVWF at the 50 IU/kg dose was 16 hours. T1/2with pdVWF:FVIII at the same dose level appeared shorter at 12.58 hours, however, thelimits of the 90% CI were similar (11.73 to 17.7 hours vs. 11.87 to 18.03 hours).

In consequence of the missing ADAMTS13 cleavage ,ultra-large molecular weight (ULMW) multimers ar e contained in the rVWF final product. The immediate cleavage of these ultra -large multimers by ADAMTS13 upon release into the circulation could be demonstrated appl ying sodium dodecy l sulfate poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE )/Immunoblot with p olyclonal an ti-VWF antibodies to detect the resulting rVWF subunit cleavage fragments. Overall the data generated in this phase 1 study suggest that rVWF: ADVATE is well tolerated and safe in adults with severe VWD. 6.5.2.2 Study 071104 This study was a prospective, uncontrolled, non- randomized, multicenter proof of concept stud y to assess safet y and PK of the addition of rVWF to ADVATE treatment in 12 evaluable subjects with severe hemophilia A . All subjects underwent 3 PK analy ses: the first after infusion with ADVATE alone, the second after infusion with ADVATE plus 10 I U/kg rVWF and the third after infusion with ADVATE plus 50 IU/kg rVWF. The PK anal ysis was performed at intervals of approximately 8 to 14 day s. Before each infusion for PK assessment ,there wasa wash -out period of at least 5 day s and the subjects were not actively bleeding. Primary outcome measures indicate that co -administration of rVWF slightly sustain ADVATE activity with the highest observed ADVATE half-life of 13.74 h (CI 11.44 to16.52) after co- infusion of 50 IU/ kg ADVATE plus 50 IU/kg rVWF :RCo . Thehighest improvement in ADVATE circulating half -life was observed in subjects with VWF:Ag levels below 100% which indicates an association between bas eline VWF:Ag levels and ADVATE half-life increase. No treatment related adverse events ( A Es)or serious adverse events ( SAEs )were reported . No subject withdrew due to an AE and there were no deaths. No binding antibodies to VWF, CHO ,and rFurin were detectable in the confirmatory assay and no signs of a h ypersensi ti vity to rVWF or ADVATE antigen were observed. Laboratory values over time did not indicate an y potential safety risk for hemophilia A patients treated with rVWF and ADVATE in combinat ion. For non-commercial use only"

The study consisted of 2 parts (Part A and Part B). Part A consisted of PK assessments alone (Arm 2: PK50 onl y [without treatment of bleeding episodes]), or PK assessments (Arm 1: PK50 and Arm 3: PK80) plus on -demand treatment period(s) of 6 months for bleeding episodes, or on -demand treatment for bleeding episodes only (Arm 4). Subjects receiving treatment for PK assessments and/or bleeding episodes in Part A were to be entered into Part B to continue on-demand treatment for bleeding episodes for 6additional months for a total of 12 months in the study . The primary outcome measure was the number of subjects with “treatment success” (extent of control of bleeding episodes), which was defined as a mean efficacy rating score of < 2.5 for a subject’s I P-treated bleeding episodes during th e stud y. The rate of subjects with treatment success was 100% (Clopper -Pearson exact 90% CI: 84.7 to 100.0) for bleeds where the assessments were made prospectivel y and excluding GI bleeds. Sensitivity anal yses confirmed the results of the primary anal ysis. Crossover results at 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo showed that the PK profile for rVWF VWF:RCo was independent of administration alone or with rFVIII (ADVATE) (T 1/2: 19.4 hours for rVWF and 16.6 hours for rVWF:rFVIII; IR: 1.8 U/dL per IU/kg infused for both rVWF and rVWF:rFVIII; MRT: 26.7 hours for rVWF and 25.2 hours for rVWF:rFVIII). FVIII levels increased substantially with a median peak at 24 hours of 111.0 U/dL for rVWF:rFVIII and 86.0 U/dL after rVWF alone, indicating that rVWF induces a sustained increase in e ndogenous FVIII activity . The rVWF PK profile was comparable at 50 IU/kg and 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo, and repeated PK at 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo showed close agreement between pretreatment and end -of-study results.

Using 50 IU/kg for PK measurements, subjects in the 071001 study exhibiting a T1/2for rVWF of 14, 16,or 19 hours had BAX111 plasma concentrations at 72 hours after administration of 2.55, 4.01 ,and 6.49% above baseline, respectivel y, and plasma concentrations at 96 hours after administration of 0.78, 1.40, and 2.71% above baseline, respectivel y. Subj ects who have significant spontaneous bleeding while on twice weekl yproph ylaxis will have their regimen increase dto 50IU/kg 3 times per week ( see Section 8.7.4.2). A total of 125 AEs occurred in 25/37 (67.7%) subjects (62/318 infusions [19.5%]) during or after infusion with I P. Of these, 116/125 were non -serious (all mild or moderate; none were severe ), and 9 SAEs were reported in 7 subjects. Of 125 total AEs, 38 were temporally associated with I P; 8 AEs were considered causally related to I P: 6 non- serious related AEs (tach ycardia, infusion site paraesthesia, electrocardiogram [ECG ] t-wave inversion, dysgeusia, generalized pruriti s, and hot flush) occurred in 4 subjects, and 2 related SAEs (chest discomfort and incr eased heart rate) occurred in 1subject. No deaths occurred during this study . None of the subjects developed anti- VWF or anti -FVIII neutr alizing antibodies and no binding antibodies to VWF or rFurin, or antibodies against CHO protein or anti -Murine IgG were observed. No clinical or subclinical signs or symptoms of a thrombogenic event were observed in this study . Following an initial increa se in ultralarge VWF multimers after administration of rVWF, a notable decrease in the proportion of large VWF multimers occurred between 12 and 24 hours post infusion, due to degradation by the endogenous ADAMTS13 followed b y a continued decline until the end of the 96- hour follow -up period. Overall, the data support the safe and effective use of rVWF with or without FVIII (ADVATE) in the treatment of bleeds in patients with VWD. 6.5.2.4 Study 071401: Single Subject with von Willebrand Disease One subject who exhibited allergic reactions to currently marketed pdVWF products was treated in the single -subject study 071401 with rVWF only for the bleed treatment of continued hematuria, and for biopsy and surgical resection of a left -kidney mass. For the initial rVWF i nfusion, the subject received a test dose of 5% of the total dose of 60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo at an infusion rate of 1 mL/min.

The subject was monitored for an y signs of an allergic reaction, and none were noted. Treatment with rVWF every 12 to 24 hours was tocontinue at the discretion of the investigator based on VWF levels and clinical symptomatology . The subject had an excellent response and recovery , which allowed for daily dosing of rVWF and, within 24 hours, the subject’s bleeding had stopped. Dail y dosing of rVWF was maintained and the subject received his last dose on . The subject also received rVWF for 7 days for prophy laxis for surgery (surgical resection of a left -kidney mass). The subject experienced no hemorrhagic complications and no AEs that were considered related to the use of rVWF. 6.6 Evaluation of Anticipated Risks and Benefits of the Inv estigational Product(s) to Human Subjects Current treatment of VWD patients relies on desmopressin and VWF products manufactured from pooled human plasma. Human VWF produced b y recombinant technology could offer a new perspective in treatment of VWD. The benefit for the individual subject is anticipated to be significant during this clinical stud y. He/she may benefit from a product that minimizes excessive FVIII administration. Variations in VWF multimeric composition may lead to variabilit y with respect to treating or preventing bleeds in VWD subjects, especiall y mucosal bleeds which are especially problematic. rVWF product manufactured by Baxalta consistently contains ultra -large molecular weight (ULMW) VWF multimers due to the fact that the product has no t been exposed to ADAMTS13. The initial presence of these ULMW VWF multimers, which are subsequently cleaved by the subject’s endogenous ADAMTS13, may result in improved platelet and collagen binding and therefore provide more p redictable treatment outcome s. By using a recombinant product, the risk of contamination with blood derived viruses or variant Creutzfeldt -Jakob Disease associated with the use of products of human or animal origin has been virtuall y eliminated. At this stage of product development, the key societal benefit is a better understanding of advanced treatment options for VWD and enhanced product availability . For non-commercial use only"

Investigational product infusions should be given at a rate which should not exceed 4mL/minute. The investigator/ subject shall ensure that no visible residual volume remains in the sy ringe(s) and that the complete content is administered. Upon completion of the infusion, the butterfly catheter should be flushed with at least 2 mL of saline solution. I n case of a (central) venous access device, the flush should be with at least 10mL of saline solution. The IP infusions should be administered over a duration of 2 to 15 minutes, depending on the volume. Only the actual potencies of rVWF and ADVATE as stated on the vial labels and described in the Pharmacy Manual should be used. A variation of up to 10 % of the intended dose for proph ylactic infusions and of the intended dose for treatment of bleeding episodes is permissible and the exact dose should be recorde d on the Case Report Form (CRF). At study visits w here recovery anal ysis is being done, vials with the same lot numbers should be used throughout the PK I P infusion per subject. For treatment of bleeding episodes there are 2 options for the preparation of rVWF and ADVATE for infusion if needed . Preferably sequential administration will be done: separate s yringes of the appropriate dose of rVWF and ADVATE willbe prepared for sequential infusion. rVWF should be infused first sequentiall y followed preferably within 10 minutes by infusion of ADVATE . Only the actual potencies of rVWF and ADVATE as stated on the vial labels and described in the Pharmacy Manual shou ld be used. Alternativel y,premixed solutions can be administered: rVWF and ADVATE will be an i.v.admixture in a single syringe to achieve the appropriate dose. The contents of each vial of rVWF or ADVATE can be drawn into 1syringe b y using a separate unused reconstitution device as described in the Pharmacy Manual. The final dose of rVWF: ADVATE shoul d be at a ratio of 1.3:1 ± 0.2. For non-commercial use only"

At the baseline visit the subjects will receive a dose of 50 ± 5IU/kg rVWF:RCo for PK assessment . Blood samples will be drawn within 30 min utes pre -infusion, and at 7 time points post -infusion ( 305 min utes, 605minutes, 61 hours , 12  1 hours , 242 hours, 482 hours , 722 hours ). Subject spreviously enrolled in rVWF studies 070701 or 0710 01and having previously undergone PK assessments in these studies are required to repeat the PK assessment due to different dose and time points used in the seformer studies (see Section 12.9.1 and Section 20.3) . Awashout period of at least 5 day s is required prior to infusion of rVWF for PK assessment for subjects previously treated with rVWF. Subjects who participated and had a major procedure performed in the surgery study 071101 will not need an additional PK assessment. Identical PK dose and time points are used for both studies 071101 and 071301. Subjects who participated and had a minor procedure performed in the surgery study 071101 will need a PK assessment. 8.7.4.2 Prophylaxis Initiation Treatment The proph ylaxis initiation treatment visit will coincide with the 72 2 h PK assessment. At this visit subjects will receive their proph ylaxis initiation dose of 50 ± 10 IU/kg rVWF :RCo after the blood draw for the 72 2 hours post-infusion PK assessment . If subjects do not need an additional PK assessment (e.g., subject has participated in the surgery study 071101 and had a major procedure performed ),subjects must receive the IP for proph ylaxis initiation treatment within 42days after screening and confirmation of eligibility . The exact standard proph ylaxis do se may rang e between 40 and 6 0 IU/kg based on: available historic al PK data type and severity of bleeding episodes the subject has experienced in the past and monitoring of appropriate c linical and laboratory measures Dose adjustments during the continued proph ylactic treatment are described in Section 8.7.4.3.

Upon resolution of the bleeding event, the subject will return to their assigned proph ylaxis regimen. Itis essential for the success of this study that the subjects adhere to treatment regimens. Therefore, proce dures for monitoring subject’s compliance are implemented (see Section 10.7) . If 1infusion of IP is missed, the subject may administer the I P as soon as possible .The subject should adhere to the irtreatment scheme ensuring a minimum interval of 12 hours between this and the previous I P infusion. For example ,a subject routinel y infuses I P on Monday and Thursday ,he/she mi sses the Monday time point and therefore may infuse the IP on the next day (Tuesday )and thereafter proceed with infusing the IP on Thursday (considering a minimum 12 hours between the infusions )and return to the initial schedule. If more than 30% of infusions of IP are misse dwithin the visit interval of 3 months the subject will be discontinued from the stud y (see Section 9.4). 8.7.4.3.2 General Instructions for Home Treatment forProphylaxis At the discretion of the investigator, a subject may be considered suitable for home treatment only after the subject has received at least 1infusion of I Pin the clinic ,either during planned IP exposure (PK or proph ylaxis) or during the treatment of bleeding episodes, and meets the following additional criteria : 1.Fully understands the concept of a clinical study and related documentation (documented training of at least 30 minutes), 2.Has a history of previous experience with home treatment including self-administration and treatment with VWF containing concentrates , 3.Has adequate time for initial training of the stud y drug preparation (preparation, mixing and infusion of the IP(s) (documented tr aining of at least 30 minutes) .

If the subject initiates the treatment at home, he/she should at least follow up with the study site if avisit is needed as per the standard of care at the center . In the event a healthcare professional is required to administer treatment at the subject’s home, he/she must be trained and qualified b y the site investigator on the above procedures prior to the decision for home treatment. Once a subject has received 1infusion of rVWF in the clinic (either during planned I P exposure or during the treatment o f a bleeding episode) and meet s the criteria for home treatment, the treatment of bleeding episodes with I P can be conducted at home (see Section 8.7.4.3.2). If a subject is not qualified for home treatment, rVWF infusions must be administered at the study site. If a subject experiences a bleeding episode that requires treatment between the screening and the proph ylaxis initiation visit , the subject will be treated with I P (rVWF with or without ADVATE ). Treatment with I P must occur at the study site unless the subject has previously qualified for home treatment with rVWF. If rVWF treatment is not feasible, the subject may use his/her standard of care, such as commercial pdVWF/FVII I products. In any case a washout period of at least 5 day s is required prior to rVWF PK infusion at the PK assessment visit. If a subject experiences a bleeding episode requiring treatment during the PK assessment, rVWF will be used to treat the bleed . Blood draws for PK assessment will be stopped and the PK assessments will be repeated once the bleed has resolved and the subject is free of any symptoms related with the bleeding episode . Dose and frequency of rVWF infusions or an y other replacement therap yto stop the bleed should be recorded in the e -CRF. 8.7.4.4.2 Dosing Recommendations for Treatment of Bleeding Episodes If an acute bleeding episode occurs ,the subject will be treated with rVWF with or without ADVATE . In general i nitially , an infusion of rVWF: ADVATE at anrVWF: ADVATE ratio of 1.3:1± 0.2 will be administered. Subsequent infusion smay either use rVWF alone or with ADVATE, based on FVIII levels, if available. If FVIII levels are not available, dosing is at the discretion of the investigator based upon the individual subject’s PK data.

Therefore, reduced doses of ADVATE and/or prolongation of the dose interval should be considered. In general th e aim of the initial dose should be full replacement of VWF with VWF:RCo levels of >0 .6IU/ml (60%) and FVIII:C of > 0.4 IU/mL (40%). In major bleeding episodes ,subsequent doses should keep the trough level of VWF:RCo >50% for 3 day s and then as deemed nec essary by the investigator for subsequent days. In moderate bleeding episodes ,the dose and trough level may be reduced to >30% for as long as deemed necessary by the investigator. Treatment for minor bleeding episodes will generall y consist of onl y 1 or 2 doses of rVWF IP. If the VWF:RCo level is above 150%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 12 hours; if the VWF:RCo level is above 200%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 24 hours. In either case, a lower subsequent dose (e.g., 20 IU/kg VWF:RCo) may be appropriate. Dosing recommendations are listed in Table 3. Dosage must be individualized based on the subject ’s weight, VWD type,and the severit y of the bleeding episode , as well as on monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory measures. In the phase 1 study 070701, 1 .0IU/kg VWF:RCo raised the circulating level of VWF:RCo by 0.017 IU/mL (1.7 %). In the same study , the observed mean half -life for rVWF was 19.3 hours, with a st andard deviation of 10.9 hours. For non-commercial use only"

A diagnosis of menorrhagia will be defined by a prospectively completed Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) score >185 and normal cervical cytology or requiring use of a VWF -containing concentrate for treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding for at least one menstrual cycle during the prior year. Variances of up to 10% in dosing are permissible during treatmen t of bleeding episodes, but rounding to the nearest vial size should be avoided. Subjects with non- neutralizing binding anti -VWF antibodies should initially be treated with a dose known to be efficacious based on the subject’s medical treatment history which may differ from the recommendations provided in Table 3. Subjects should be monitored for lack of efficacy as well as for FVIII (mandatory ), VWF:RCo (m andatory ), and VWF:Ag (optional where testing is not available) levels after 3 to 6hours. Re -dosing with rVWF in combination with ADVATE using the same (initial) dose and adaptation of the dosing frequency should be considered until cessation of the bleed, if the FVIII and/or VWF:RCo levels drop below 30% - 50% depending on bleeding severit y. The number of subsequent infusions and the dosage levels prescribed will be determined by the investigator on the basis of the clinical severity , response to current therapy , available laboratory data, and the subject’s historical treatment for similar bleeding episode s. 8.7.5 Investigational Product Accountability The investigator will ensure that the IP (s)isstored as specified in the Pharmacy Manual and that the storage area is secured, with access limited to authorized study personnel.

If the I P is not infused within 42 days,allscreening assessments except blood group, human leucocy te antigen ( HLA ) , genetics , multimeric pattern and ,must be repeated to reconfirm eligibility . Refe r to Supplement 20.2 and Supplement 20.3.Upon completion of screening procedures, subject eligibility will be confirmed by the sponsor on a subject eligibility form before additional study procedures are undertaken. The subject will maintain a diary that will include infusion logs (see Section 10.5). The allocation of IP will be initiated after the subject has qualified for home treatment (see Section 8.7.4.3.2). In the event ofa subject experienc inga bleeding episode that requires treatment between the screening visit and the baseline visit (PK assessment visit), the subject willbe treated with rVWF. If rVWF is not available for any reason , e.g., subject not yet trained on IP administration, study site visit for I P administration not feasible, etc ., the subject may use his/her standard of care, such as commercial pdVWF/FVIII products . 10.3.2 Baseline Vi sit -PK-Assessment V isit After screening and confirmation of eligibility each subject will undergo a PK assessmen t .Subjects who participated in the surgery study 071101 will not need to undergo a PK baseline assessment again if they had a major procedur e performed , provided valid PK data from 071101 is available. These subjects may proceed directly with the prophy laxis initiation visit (refer to Section 10.3.3 ). All subjects will receive a dose of 50 ± 5 IU/kg rVWF:RCo to determine VWF and FVIII levels. Blood samples will be drawn within 30 minutes pre-infusion, and at 7 time points post -infusion (305minutes, 60 5 minutes, 6 1 hours, 12 1 hours, 24 2 hours, 48 2hours, 722hours) .

Where needed, the phlebotomy site will be kept patent via an infusion of normal saline. In this event, at least 5 mL of blood will be collected and discarded before collection of the next test sample into a fresh syringe. If the subject has a central venous catheter, the central line should be used to admini ster the infusion and a peripheral venipuncture should be used to collect the blood samples. Inthe event that a blood sample must be drawn through the central line used for administration of I P, the line must first be flushed with at least 10 mL normal sa line or other suitable catheter flush solution that does not contain anticoagulant. At least 5 mL of whole blood must be collected and discarded prior to obtaining the sample. If a subject experiences a bleeding episode during the PK assessment no subsequ ent blood sample will be drawn in that specific PK period. The guidance provided in Section 8.7.4.4 has to be followed for the treatment of the ble eding episode. The subject once recovered is eligible to repeat the PK assessment. 10.3.3 Prophylaxis Initiation V isit After the blood sample for the 72 hour PK assessment is drawn t he subject will receive the first rVWF proph ylactic dose of 50 ± 10 IU/kg rVWF: RCo .Details on dose are provided in Section 8.7.4.3. If a subject did not undergo PK assessment (for example the subject has participated in the surgery study 071101 and has undergone PK in Study 071101 and had a major procedure performed , refer to Section 8.7.4.2 ), procedures and assess ments at this visit include: adverse events, bleeding episodes, medications taken, non- drug therapies and laboratory assessment .Independent of previous PK assessment visits, w ithin 2 hours prior the IP infusion, a phy sical examination will be performed. Vital signs will be assessed within 30 minutes prior to I PrVWF infusion and 30 minute s ±15 minutes after IP infusion. For subjects with a previous PK assessment in the course of the surgery study , incremental recovery (IR) will be determined based on VWF :RCo activity assessed prior and after IP infusion .

However, when there is an increase in the severit y, duration, or frequency of a preexisting disease, the event must be described on the AE CRF. 12.1.2 Assessment of Adverse Events For the purposes of this study , the following will not be considered as AEs and will not be included in the analy sis of AEs. Bleeding episodes are part of the underl ying disease and therefore are not AEs; they will be evaluated in the context of efficacy . For non -serious bleeding episode scaused b y an injury, the injury would not be reported as an AE, unless it resulted in a medica l finding other than a bleeding episode (e.g., abrasion of ski n). Therefore, any VWD -related bleeding event (e.g., epistaxis, gas trointestinal bleeding, musculo -skeletal bleeding, menorrhagia) that is non -serious will not be reported as an AE. However, the investigator may decide that the event is an AE if the event also would have occurred in a healthy individual under the same circumstances. For SAEs: Bleeding events that meet seriousness criteria (death, life-threatening, hospitalizing/prolongation of ho spitalization, disability , congenital anomal y, or medicall y significant and if not urgently treated would result in one of the above) should be reported on the SAE eCRF or SAE Report form as a n SAE . Seroconversion after documented HAV/HBV vaccination prior to or during the study period.

Recovering/resolving AEs will be followed until resolution . If the severity rating for an ongoing AE changes before the event resolves, the original AE report will be revised (i.e., the event will not be reported as separate AE). During the course of an y AE, the highest severit y rating will be reported.

Causality assessment includes, e .g., assessment of temporal relationships, dechallenge/rechallenge information, association (or lack of association) with underly ing disease, presence (or absence) of a more likely cause, and ph ysiological plausibili ty. For each AE, the investigator will assess the causal relationship between the IP and the AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment according to the following most appropriate algorithm for the circumstances of the AE: Not related (both circumsta nces must be met) Is due to underl ying or concurrent illness, complications, concurrent treatments, or effects of concurrent drugs For non-commercial use only"

In general all laboratory tests will be performed at central laboratories , except the pregnancy and blood group test which will be performed at the local laboratory .In addition, relevant critical safet y laboratory tests for complete blood count (CBC ), serum chemistry and/or coagulation parameters such as VWF and FVIII activity may also be performed in the local laboratory to ensure that results will be available immediately to the investigator. In principle, results from the central laboratory will be used for data analysis purposes. The assay s performed in the central laboratories are specified in the Laboratory Manual. The i nvestigator will supply the sponsor with a list of the normal ranges and units of measurement for the laboratory variables to be determin ed at the site.

If a subject experiences a bleeding episode during the PK assessment no subsequent blood sample will be drawn in that specific PK period. The guidance provided in Section 8.7.4.4 has to be followed for the treatment of the bleeding episode. The subject once recovered is eligible to repeat the PK assessment.

Testing will be done prior to I P infusion and with at least a 72hour wash out period since the last I P infusion. If there is any suspicion of inhibitor development (e.g. excessive bleeding) binding and neutralizing antibodies to VWF and FVIII may be tested at the discretion of the investigator. 12.9.3.2 Neutralizing andTotal Binding Anti- VWF Antibodies The assay s to establish the presence of neutralizing and total binding anti -VWF antibodies have been established in the absence of international standards and with only limited numbers of positive controls. Therefore, cau tion is advised in interpreting positive results. I n particular, any clinical association, changes in the natural history of the disease, effect of therapy, etc. needs to be taken into account for final judgment. Thesponsor’s Medical Director should be co nsulted for additional advice. As part of the AE follow -up, an y sample testing positive needs to be confirmed after 2 -4 weeks for central laboratory testing. Only confirmed neutralizing anti -VWF antibodies are considered inhibitors (see Section 12.9.3.4) . These subjects need to be closely monitored and therap y adjusted accordingl y. 12.9.3.3 Binding antibodies to VWF The presence of total binding anti -VWF an tibodies will be determined b y an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) employ ing poly clonal anti -human Immunoglobulin (Ig)antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA). For this assay (ELI SA), recombinant human VWF will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then incubated with dilutions of the positive control, the negative control or test sample. Antibodies against human VWF that are present in the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -coupled goat anti- human antibody (secondary antibody ). The positive control for this assay will be a human monoclonal antibody specific for human VWF spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human plasma. Plasma samples are analy zed for binding antibodies against the specific antigen in two steps. First, the sample is screened for antibodies and the titer of bindin g antibodies is For non-commercial use only"

Second, the specificit y of positive antibody results is confirmed.16 Inbrief, all samples are serially diluted (in itial dilution 1:20 and further diluted 1:2). Thetiter endpoint, defined as the highest dilution that still gives a positive signal above cut off level, is determined in two independent duplicates. The cut off level is established based on background sig nal level of healthy plasma donors (n=160) and set to include 5% false positives to be as sensitive as possible (95% percentile). The ELISA assay is validated allowing a nassay variability of ± 1 titer step. Therefore, differences ≤ 2 titers steps may be d ue to variability of the ELISA assay. Specificity has to be confirmed in a competition assay when a sample has a titer of 1:80 or higher in the screening assay . Based on the validation criteria samples tested in the screening assay at 1:20 or 1:40 cannot be confirmed in the competition assay . A positive screening value is confirmed if the difference between the titers determined for the subject sample (re -screen) and for the subject sample with pre -incubation (confirmation sample) is > 2 titer steps. Antibo dy titers of subject samples will only be reported as positive, if the results of the screening and confirmatory anal ysis fulfill these acceptance criteria. The titer to be reported is alway s the one determined in the original screening procedure (independ ent of the result of the re -screening in the confirmation procedure). A more detailed test procedure will be supplied upon request or pro -actively if a sample tests positive. A treatment related increase of the binding anti -VWF antibodies is expected, if the titer increases by more than 2 titration steps. These subjects need to be closely monitored and therapy adjusted accordingly . 12.9.3.4 Neutralizi ng A ntibodies to VWF Three functional VWF assay s, collagen binding (VWF:CB) assay , Ristocetin cofactor (VWF:RCo) and FVIII binding (VWF:FVIIIB), will be used to test for the presence of neutralizing anti-VWF antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies to VWF:RCo, VWF:CB and VWF:FVIIIB activities will be measured b y assay s based on the Bethesda assay established for quantitative anal ysis of FVIII inhibitors (Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay ).17The amount of inhibitor is expressed as Bethesda units (BU) per mL. One BU is thereb y defined as the amount of inhibitor that decreases the measured activity in the ass ays to 50% of that of the negative control samples. The assay s were validated using human plasma samples from two ty pe 3 VWD patients with low (1 -2 BU/mL) and high (~10 BU/mL) titer inhibitors and plasma samples from non -human primates immunized with human rVWF (>100 BU/mL) For non-commercial use only"

However, if baseline levels are too high (>15% VWF:RCo), inhibitors may not be r eliabl y detected. To exclude false positive results, the detection limit for anti-VWF inhibitors was set to 1BU/ml for all 3 assay s. The rationale for this cut -off value is the relativel y high CIof the underl ying assay s, making determinations at the end of the evaluation range of the Bethesda reference curve uncertain.18 A more detailed test procedure may be requested to further characterize the anti -VWF inhibitors, if detected. 12.9.3.5 Binding Antibodies to FVIII Binding antibodies ag ainst FVIII will be anal yzed using a proprietary enzyme immunoassay .

To verify a FVIII inhibitor, additional testing (such as tests for L upus anticoagulants) may be initiated. Positive FVIII inhibitor tests will be defined as ≥ 0.4 BU b y the Nijmegen -modified Bethesda assay that is confirmed b y a second test performed on an independent sample obtained 2- 4 weeks followi ng the first test.

Results from multimer analy sis(see Section 12.9.10.1 )may contribute to VWD gene mutation al analysis. The genetic testing will be done, when the subject consents to the genetic testing. 12.9.9 Blood Group Analysis The blood group needs to be determined during the screening period.

Therefore VWF multimer analy sis will not only be performed routinel y at screening but i n case of thrombo embolic events both VWF multimer analy sis as well as ADAMTS13 activit y will be determined to assess an y relatedness of these occurrences w ith IP treatment. 12.9.10.1 VWF Multimer Analysis The VWF multimer pattern will be assessed using low -resolution sodium dodecy l sulfate (SDS) –agarose gel electrophoresis. High -resolution SDS –agarose gel electrophoresis, with agarose concentrations 1.5%, will be used to determine the satellite band structure of VWF. These anal yses will employ Western blot with luminescence video imaging. 12.9.10.2 ADAMTS13 Activity VWF73 was identified as the 73 amino acid minimal region of the VWF A2 domain required for ADAMTS13 cleavage. The cleavage of this substrate will be detected b y a commerciall y available ELISA -based Chromogenic assay (Technoclone Austria): Cleavage of immobilized VWF73 substrate is detected b y a HRP -labeled antibody directed against the cleavage site of VWF73.

Data for an association between the sP-selectin concentration, thrombotic thrombocy topenic purpura (TTP)and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are limited and the predictive value has not yet established. Acommercial ELISA assay will be employ ed as an exploratory test. sP -selectin will be determined at the Screening visit and used as indicator for an increased thrombotic risk. 12.9.12 D- Dimer D-dimer will be used as a marker for DVT and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) . While a negative result practically rules out thrombosis, a positive result can indicate thrombosis but does not rule out other potential etiologies, including a recent hemorrhage. Its main use, therefore, is to exclude thromboembolic disease where the probabilit y is low. D -Dimer will be measured at the Screening visit and used as indicator for an increased thrombotic risk. 12.9.13 Additional Laboratory Testing in C ase of Severe Hypersensitivity R eactions If a subject develops a severe hypersensitivity reaction in the course of the clinical study , additional blood dr aws for anti-VWF IgE antibody testing will be drawn.

The basis of the ImmunoCAP® technology is a cellulose polymer as solid phase in a plastic capsule providing a large surface for protein binding. rVWF as antigen is covalently coupled to the cellulose poly mer. Detection of specific anti-VWF IgE bound to the antigen will be accomplishe d by a secondary enzy me-labeled anti-human IgE antibod y. Testing for binding anti -human VWF IgE antibodies will be done with 0.5 mL plasma. Antibody containing samples will be identified and quantified in a screening assay followed by a confirmatory assay to exclude false positive results. 12.9.14 Exploratory Assay The INNOVANCE VWF Ac : an assay , which will eventuall y replace the VWF:RCo test in the future, will be done using the same time points/blood draws including PK assessment as outlined for the VWF:RCo asse ssments. The VWF Ac assay is a sensitive test for direct determination of VWF activity . It employ s an advanced new technology , allowing the assay to mimic the reaction in which VWF binds to gl ycoprotein I b (GPIb), the major VWF receptor protein on platelet s. Latex particles are coated with an antibody against GPIb, to which recombinant GPI b is added. 12.9.15 Assessment of Laboratory Values 12.9.15.1 Assessment of Abnormal Laboratory Values For VWF and FVIII laboratory assessments no evaluation of clinical significance is necessary . Each other laboratory value (except results to determine genetics of the underly ing VWD disease and blood group) has to be assessed b y the investigator and the assessment willbe recorded on the eCRF . The investigator will determine for each abnor mal laboratory value whether the value is considered clinically significant or not . For clinically significant values, the investigator will indicate if the value constitutes a newAE (see definition in Section 12.1) and record the sign, s ymptom, or medical diagnosis on the AE CRF , is a sy mptom or related to a previousl y recorded AE, is due to a pre -existing disease (described in Section 12.1.1.5), or is due to another issue that will be specified. If the abnormal value was not clinically significant, the investigator will indicate t he reason, i.e. because it is due to a preexisting disease, due to a lab error, due to variation or due to another issue that will be specified. A dditional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significa nce or etiology of an abnormal value ,or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained when clinically indicated. Any abnormal value that persists should be followed at the discretion of the investigator. For non-commercial use only"

For the number of infusions and for the total weight adjusted consumption of rVWF and ADVATE per month and per year during on- demand treatment, summary statistics will be carried out. For the number (proportion) of subjects with reduction of ABR relative to historic ABR as well as for the number (proportion) of subjects with 0 bleeds, proportions and corresponding 95% two -sided CI s will be performed. The annualized rate of bleeding epis odes will be calculated as (Number of bleeding episodes/observed treatment period in day s) * 365.25. The primary efficacy analy sis will be based on the FAS. As a supportive analy sis, the same anal ysis will also be carried out on the PP. The two time perio ds (prior to prophy laxis treatment and while on prophy laxis) will be compared within each subject in terms of mean ABR using a generalized estimating equations model framework (with a logarithmic link function which was the default for the negative binomia l distribution), accounting for the fixed effect of the two time periods. The follow -up time (in y ears) will be specified as an offset and an unstructured working correlation matrix will be used to account for the correlated data. Ratios between the two ti me period means (95% CI) will be estimated within this model by SAS procedure GENMOD. For non-commercial use only"

The severit y and localization of bleeding episodes will also be recorded and summarized. The anal ysis will be perfor med on the FAS. 13.4.2.3 P harmacokinetic Analysis All PK analy ses will use the actual sampling times, not nominal times specified in the protocol, wherever possible. Actual sampling times will be defined as time from the start of infusion to the blood sample collec tion time. A deviation from the protocol- specified blood sample drawing time window will not be a reason to exclude an observation from the anal ysis. Samples with unknown actual and planned collection date/time or where the concentration could not be deter mined, or where results were biological lyimplausible will be eliminated from the anal ysis.

BACKGROUND INFORMATIO N 6.1 Description of Investigational Product Baxalta US Inc. (here after referred to as Baxalta or sponsor) has developed a human recombinant von Willebrand Factor (rVWF), which is co-expressed with r ecombinant factor VIII (r FVIII )in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line andsepar ated during the subsequent downstream process. To address co ncerns regarding the risk of transmission of blood- bornepathogens that may be introduced by human plasma, no exogenousl y added raw materials of human or animal origin are employ ed in the cell culture, purification, or formulation of the final container pr oduct. The onl y proteins present in the final container product other than rVWF are trace quantities of murine immunoglobulin (IgG, from the immunoaffinity purification), host cell (i.e. , CHO) protein, rFurin (used to further process rVW F). rVWF is intende d for the treatment of von Willebrand disease (VWD). rVWF has been developed under the Baxalta internal code BAX111 and is used as investigational product (IP) in this study . rVWF may be used with or without ADVATE (rFV III) for the treatment of bleeding episodes (see Section 8.6.4.4). See Section 8.6for further information on the I Ps and their usage in this study . A detailed description of rVWF is also provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) . rVWF was granted licensure in the United States in Dec ember 2015 under the brand name VONVENDI f or the on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes in adults diagnosed with VWD ; as of the date of this protocol VONVENDI is not y et available on the market. 6.2Clinical Condition/Indication Von Willebrand Factor ( VWF )is a large multimeric gl ycoprot ein with a molecular weight that varies from 500 to 20,000 kDa. VWF is normally found in plasma and produced in the alpha -granules of platelets and in endothelial cell organelles known as the Weibel -Palade bodies. VWF mediates platelet adhesion and aggrega tion at sites of vascular injury , one of the key functions in primary hemostasis. VWF also serves to stabilize coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), where FVIII is an essential cofactor of secondary hemostasis, which leads to fibrin clot formation.2Qualitative and/or quantitative deficiencies of VWF lead to a highl y variable bleeding diathesis known as VWD, the most common of the hereditary coagulation factor deficiencies. Penetrance of VWD is highly variable, with only a small fraction of mildly affected patients display ing clinical sy mptoms or a family history of a bleeding diathesis. For non-commercial use only"
338,page_338,"rVWF Page 23of 122 Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: 071301 2017 AUG 03 BAX ALTA CONFIDENTIAL – RESTRICTED: DO NOT D ISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PR IOR APPROVALThe current biochemical -based classification distinguishes disorders arising from partial quantitative (ty pe 1), qua litative (ty pe 2), or virtually complete (t ype 3) deficiencies of VWF. Up to 70% of VWD patients are diagnosed with ty pe 1 VWD, which may also be associated with minor functional defects in the molecule. In general, patients with ty pe 1 VWD display mild cl inical sy mptoms. Approximately 20 to 30% of VWD patients are diagnosed with ty pe 2 VWD. Ty pe 2 VWD is further divided into 4 subty pes (A, B, N, and M), reflecting distinct classes of functional abnormalities. These defects result in abnormal functional and /or multimeric distribution patterns that facilitate their diagnosis. The bleeding diathesis is usually moderate and primarily affects the mucosal tissues. Type 2N VWD patients are sometimes misdiagnosed as mild hemophilia A. Finally , approximately 1% percent of VWD patients exhibit a total or near total absence of VWF, which is classified as t ype 3 VWD. The incidence of ty pe 3 VWD is estimated at 0.5-1.0 x 106. This ty pe is also associated with a ve ry low FVIII level (t ypically <5%) because the VWF carrier function for FVIII is lost. Replacement of VWF alone stabilizes endogenous FVIII, resulting in hemostatic levels withi n several hours post -infusion. Published results from studies of a plasma -derived VWF concentrate demonstrated an increase of FVIII at an approximate rate of 5.8 1 IU dL-1h-1.3Type 3 VWD patients display severe hemorrhagic s ymptoms with bleeding predominantl y in mucosal tissues, muscle and joints. All VWD patients, particularl y those with ty pe 2 or t ype 3VWD, are at an increased risk for life -threatening bleeding episodes. 6.3The Role of Prophylaxis in the M anagement of VWD The goals of long term prophy laxis in VWD are to maintain VWF and FVIII at sufficient levels to reduce the frequency and duration of ble eding episodes, the need for red blood cell transfusions, and the risk of complications, such as arthropath y.4In contrast to hemophilia ,routine prophy laxis is not as established in VWD , although prophy laxis for patients with severe VWD have alread y been in use in Sweden during the 1950s .5In those earl y days of VWD treatment plasma FVIII concentrates containing VWF fractions were applied for replacement therap y,which then were followed b y plasma derived VWF products containing fractions of FVIII (pdVW F/FVIII) . A Swedish cohort including 37 patients with t ype 3 VWD under proph ylactic median treatment of 11 years (range 2 to 45 years) was retrospectivel y anal yzed.6,7The doses used for proph ylaxis,given once weekly for at least 45 weeks per y ear, were calculated based on 12 to 50 IU/ kgbody weight (BW)of FVIII clotting activity (FVIII:C ) which approxim ately corresponded to 24 -100 IU/kg von Willebrand factor: Ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:R Co)considering that mainly Haemate with a known VWF:RCo/FVIII:C ratio of about 2 was used. An escalation of doses from 1to 3dose levels was allow ed depending on the frequency and severit y of bleeding episodes . For non-commercial use only"

Whereas the median value for bleeds per year was about 10 before prophy laxis this value could be reduced to less than 1 bleed per year during prophy laxis. The benefit of proph ylaxis for such indications was retrospectivel y also demonstrated in a cohort of Italian patients including t ype 3, 2A, 2M and typ e 1 patients. Prophy laxis was started after sever egastrointestinal or joint bleeding episodes and completely prevented bleeding episodes in 8 of these 11 patients and largely reduced the need of blood transfusions in the remaining 3. A regimen of 40 IU rV WF:RCo/kg was applied every other day or twice a week. A prospective study on prophy laxis, the PRO.WILL study , has been initiated in I taly.8 The results of a prospective study investigating the prophy laxis inchildren and young adults showed a significantly reduced bleeding frequency and bleeding score ( 3vs. 0.07; 3 vs. 0. p<0.001) compared to the pre- prophy laxis values. The median dose was 40(20-47) IU /kgVWF:RCo administered mainly twice weekly in 23 patients , 3 times a week in 7 patients and 4times a week in 2 children .9 The VWD Prophy laxis Network initiated the VWD Intern ational Proph ylaxis (VI P) trial to investigate the role of prophy laxis in patients with severe VWD including Ty pe 1, 2 , and3. The dose of the factor replaceme nt product was 50 IU /kgVWF:RCo. The frequency of the dose depended on the t ype of bleeding and could be increased from once weekl y to twice weekl y or3times per week. For the treatment of men orrhagia the dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo was given on the first day of menses for 2 cy cles. The f requency could be increased to D ay 1 and 2 for 2 cy cles or to Day 1, 2, and 3 of menses . The study contains both retrospective and prospective study components. Results from theretrospective study component were published, including 61 subjects on prophy lactic regimen in the past 6 months prior to enrollment or subjects with a history of prophy laxis over at least 6 month .10Differences in annualized bleeding rates (ABR) within individuals (during prophylaxis – before proph ylaxis) were significant for those with primary indications of epistaxis (P = 0.0005), joint bleeding (P = 0.002) and gastrointestinal ( GI)bleeding (P = 0.001). The difference in the group whose primary indication for treatment was abnormall y heav y bleeding at menstruation (n = 4) was not significant (P = 0.25). The reduction of mucosal bleeding likely not onl y dependen t s on normal circulating levels of active VWF, but also on the presence of discrete concentrations of normal VWF inside the platelets and within endothelial matrices. The low subject number (n=4) and the treatment scheme for menorrhagia on Days 1, 2, and 3 of menses which might represent rather on- demand than proph ylactic treatment may also account for the outcome in this study .

Six subjects had ty pe 2A, and 5subjects had ty pe 3 VWD. Sixsubjects presented with epistaxis, 3 with GI bleeding, and 2with joint bleeding. Seven subjects had dose escalation above the first level. Among the 10 subjects with evaluable bleeding log data, the use of prophy laxis decreased the median ABR from 25 to 6.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] of the rate difference: -51.6 to - 1.7), and the median ABR was even lower (4.0; 95% CI : -57.5 to - 5.3) when the subjects reached their final dosing level. The authors concluded that this was the first prospective study to demonstra te that proph ylaxis with VWF concentrates is highl y effective in reducing mucosal and joint bleeding rates in clinicall y severe VWD. The results of the VI P study and previous investigations suggest that VWD patients with recurrent bleeding episodes and sev ere menorrhagia will benefit from a proph ylactic VWF replacement therapy . There is evidence that up to 40% of patients with ty pe 3 VWD experience joint bleeding which can lead to hemophilic arthropath y. Other potential indications for prophy laxis include patients with ty pe 2A or 2B VWD with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, menorrhagia or frequent epistaxis .4Long-term prophy laxis for most patients with ty pe 3 VWD and in some patients with ty pe 1 or 2 VWD, depending on the pattern o f bleeding, may be the treatment option of choice . Although the main experience with long -term prophy laxis is with secondary prophy laxis, primary proph ylaxis starting at young age is recommended to prevent art hropathy in patients with severe VWD.12 However, further studies are needed to develop evidence -based guidelines for prophy lactic treatmen t in VWD. 6.4Population to b e Studied A total of approximately 18eligible , adult subjects to achieve approximately 15 evaluable subjects with severe VWD are planned to be enrolled, of which a subset of at least 5subjects will have ty pe 3 VWD. Enrolled subje cts (i .e., subjects who have signed the informed consent form) will be eligible to participate in the study if they meet all of the inclusion criteria (see Section 9.1) and none of the exclusion criteria (see Section 9.2).

Potential risks and efficacy of rVWF: ADVATE are summarized in the following sections. For additional information on nonclinical and clinical Phase 1 results refer to the rVWF IB. 6.5.1 Findings from Nonclinical Studies 6.5.1.1 Primary Pharmacodynamics Efficacy of rVWF combined with ADVATE was shown in VWD animal models, which have also low endogenous FVIII levels. Time to occlusion and stable th rombus formation was asse ssed in the carotid occlusion m odel in VWD mice. The results demonstrated that rVWF in combination with ADVATE acted efficiently in a dose -depend ent manner and had higher efficacy than rVWF alone or plasma derived ( pd)VWF. These results were confirmed in an additional study assessing blood loss and survival in a tail tip bleeding model in VW D mice . In a VWD dog rVWF stabilized canine FVI II in the circulation and significantl y reduced the bleeding time. 6.5.1.2 Safety Pharmacology The anaph ylactoid and thrombogenic potential of the co -infusion of ADVATE and rVWF and the co- infused product’s effects on blood pressure, cardiac and respiratory funct ion and parameters of coagulation activation were investigated in 4in vivo studies in different animal models. Safety pharma cology studies in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits ,and dogs revealed no risks for anaph ylactoid and thrombogenic potential of ADVATE in combination with rVWF. All observations in safety pharmacology studies are considered to lie within the biological variability of animal models or occurred due to known species -specific anaphy lactoid effects of excipients . 6.5.1.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies of both rVWF alone and combined with human rFVIII (rVWF+ ADVATE ) were conducted in VWD mice, VWD dogs, VWD pigs, rats, and cynomolgus monkey s. Human rVWF stabilized the endogenous FVIII in VWD mice, VWD pigs , and VWD dogs. Furthermore, the h ypothese s that the area under the curve (AUC )with rVWF alone and rVWF+ ADVATE is not inferior to the AUC with pdVWF (Haemate P) was tested and confirmed statistically in normal rats.

The PK data in the FVIII knock out (k.o.) mice model are inconclusive and might not be relevant for the clinical situation. However, a stabilizing effect of VWF on FVIII could be shown in a double knock out model in a dose depend ent manner. 6.5.1.4 Toxicology Single dose toxicity studies were conducted in C57BL/6J -mice, VWD mice, rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkeys. Rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkey s showed no signs of toxicity . Signs of microthrombosis, an exaggerated pharmacological effect, were observed in mice. Mice are not capable of sufficiently cleaving the rVWF subunit as murine disintegrin and m etalloproteinase with a thrombo spondin ty pe 1 motif, number 13 (ADAMTS13 )does not decr ease the ultra -large molecular weight multimers of rVWF .13 The observed s ymptoms of microthrombosis are interpreted as a species -specific exaggerated pharmacological effect. Studies evaluating the safet y of repeated administration of rVWF with or without ADVATE (daily over 14 day s) were performed in a rodent (rat) and non -rodent (cy nomolgus monkey ) species. Reversible signs of exaggerated pharmacological effects (regenerative anemia, thrombocy topenia, and treatment -related histopathologic changes in the heart, liver, and spleen) were observed in rats that were administered 1400 U VWF:RCo/kg /day + 1080 IU ADVATE /kg/day intravenously once daily for 14 day s. Also, these findings are interpreted as a species -specific exaggerated pharmacological effect due to the low susceptibility of human rVWF to cleavage by rodent ADAMTS13.13Notoxicologicall y relevant changes were evident for clinical observations, body weight, feed consumption, ophthalmology , urinaly sis, coagulation, and serum chemistry parameters, platelet aggregation, and gross pathology .rVWF combined with ADVATE was well tolerated in cy nomolgus monkey s after daily intravenous ( i.v.) (bolus) administration of 100 U VWF:RCo/kg rVWF combined with 77 IU/kg ADVATE over a period of 14 day s. No adverse effects could be detected in this species. There were no signs of hemoly sis, thrombosis ,or thrombocytopenia after repeated intravenous application of rVWF with or without ADVATE . Therefore, 100 UVWF:RCo/kg/day rVWF with or without 77 IU/kg ADVATE was considered the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL )inthis study , which was the highest dose tested. Anti- drug antibodies, however, were formed in both species and resulted in a significant reduction in drug exposure after 14 applications as compared to a single application. These antibodies substantially reduced the sy stemic exposure to the test substance as compared to a single dose administration. No adverse effects due to antibody formation were observed in both species. For non-commercial use only"

Details on study design, populations enrolled, and safety and efficacy outcomes of these 2 phase 1 studies are presented in Section 6.5.2.1 andSection 6.5.2.2, and the ph ase 3 stud y in Section 6.5.2.3. Information on a single subject with VWD in Study 071401 is presented in Section 6.5.2.4. Refer to rVWF IB for periodic updates from other rVWF studies. 6.5.2.1 Study 070701 Phase 1 clinical study 070701 was a multicenter, controlled, randomized, single -blind , prospective 3 -step, dose escalation study to investigate safet y, tolerability ,and PK of rVWF combined at a fixed ratio with ADVATE (VWF:RCo/FVIII:C of 1.3 ± 0.2:1) in adults with severe VWD .14Subjects were enrolled in sequential cohorts in a dose escalating manner: Cohort 1, 2 ,and 3 received a single intravenous infusion of rVWF: ADVATE at the following doses: 2 IU/kg VWF:RCo (Cohort 1), 7.5 IU/kg VWF:RCo (Cohort 2), and 20 IU/kg VWF:RCo (Cohort 3). Su bjects in Cohort 4 received a single intravenous infusion of rVWF:ADVATE and pdVWF/ ADVATE at 50 I U/kg VWF:RCo in random order. The primary endpoint was the tolerability and safety after single dose injections of rVWF: ADVATE at 2, 7.5, 20 ,and 50 IU/kg VWF :RCo for up to 30 day s after the last I P infusion. The data generated in this phase 1 study suggest that rVWF: ADVATE up to the highest investigated dose of 50 IU /kgVWF:RCo is well tolerated and safe in adults with severe VWD. No thrombogenic risk or TTP -like sy ndrome was observed, and no neutralizing antibodies to VWF or FVIII were identified. There were no deaths or other serious adverse reactions, and no infusions were interrupted or stopped due to an AE. For non-commercial use only"

Secondar y endpoints were the PK assessment of VWF:RCo, von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag )and multimeric composition of rVWF as well as FVIII:C at standardized time points after single injections o f rVWF: ADVATE and pdVWF:FVIII. The median VWF:RCo half -life (T 1/2)of rVWF at the 50 IU/kg dose was 16 hours. T1/2with pdVWF:FVIII at the same dose level appeared shorter at 12.58 hours, however, thelimits of the 90% CI were similar (11.73 to 17.7 hours vs. 11.87 to 18.03 hours). Themedian half -lives of VWF:RCo were shorter with the lower investigated doses: 7.13 hours and 13.23 hours with the 7.5 IU/kg and 20 IU/kg doses, although these data were de rived from a much sm aller number of subjects. In consequence of the missing ADAMTS13 cleavage ,ultra-large molecular weight (ULMW) multimers are contained in the rVWF final product. The immediate cleavage of these ultra -large multimers by ADAMTS13 upon rel ease into the circulation could be demonstrated appl ying sodium dodecy l sulfate poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE )/Immunoblot with poly clonal an ti-VWF antibodies to detect the resulting rVWF subunit cleavage fragments. Overall the data generated in this phase 1 study suggest that rVWF: ADVATE is well tolerated and safe in adults with severe VWD. 6.5.2.2 Study 071104 This study was a prospective, uncontrolled, non- randomized, multicenter proof of concept stud y to assess safet y and PK of the addition of rVWF to ADVATE treatment in 12 evaluable subjects with severe hemophilia A . All subjects underwent 3 PK analy ses: the first after infusion with ADVATE alone, the second after infusion with ADVATE plus 10 I U/kg rVWF and the third afte r infusion with ADVATE plus 50 IU/kg rVWF. The PK anal ysis was performed at intervals of approximately 8 to 14 day s. Before each infusion for PK assessment, there wasa wash -out period of at least 5 day s and the subjects were not actively bleeding. Prima ry outcome measures indicate that co -administration of rVWF slightly sustain ADVATE activity with the highest observed ADVATE half-life of 13.74 h (CI 11.44 to16.52) after co- infusion of 50 IU/ kg ADVATE plus 50 IU/kg rVWF :RCo .

No treatment related adverse events ( AEs) or serious adverse events ( SAEs )were reported . No subject withdrew due to an AE and there were no deaths. No binding antibodies to VWF, CHO ,and rFurin were detectable in the confirmatory assay and no signs of a h ypersensi ti vity to rVWF or ADVATE antigen were observed. Laboratory values ove r time did not indicate an y potential safety risk for hemophilia A patients treated with rVWF and ADVATE in combination. In summary , the data indicate that rVWF co-administered with ADVATE up to the highest dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo is well tolerated and sa fe in hemophilia A patients. 6.5.2.3 Study 071001 This was a phase 3, multicenter, open-label, part- randomized clinical study to assess the PK, safet y,and efficacy of rVWF:rFVIII and rVWF in the treatment of bleeding episodes in adult subjects with severe t ype 3 and severe non -type 3 VWD .15A total of 49 subjects were enrolled (signed informed consent) an d screened, 18 subjects were randomized (Arm 1 and Arm 2 [PK 50] only ), 37 subjects were treated with I P (all study arms) ,and 30subjects completed the study . The study consisted of 2 parts (Part A and Part B). Part A consisted of PK assessments alone (Arm 2: PK50 onl y [without treatment of bleeding episodes]), or PK assessments (Arm 1: PK50 and Arm 3: PK80) plus on -demand treatment period(s) of 6 months for bleeding episodes, or on -demand treatment for bleeding episodes only (Arm 4). Subjects receiving treatment for PK assessments and/or bleeding episodes in Part A were to be entered into Part B to continue on-demand treatment for bleeding episodes for 6 additional months for a total o f 12 months in the study . The primary outcome measure was the number of subjects with “treatment success” (extent of control of bleeding episodes), which was defined as a mean efficacy rating score of < 2.5 for a subject’s I P-treated bleeding episodes duri ng the stud y. The rate of subjects with treatment success was 100% (Clopper -Pearson exact 90% CI: 84.7 to 100.0) for bleeds where the assessments were made prospectivel y and excluding GI bleeds.

FVIII levels increased substantially with a median peak at 24 hours of 111.0 U/dL for rVWF:rFVIII and 86.0 U/dL after rVWF alone, indicating that rVWF induces a sustained increase in endogenous FVIII activity . The rVWF PK profile was comparable at 50 IU/kg and 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo, and repeated PK at 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo showed close agreement between pretreatment and end -of-study results. Further anal ysis of the PK data from the 071001 study supports the initial use of 50 IU/kg twice weekly for prophy laxis dosing in the present study for those subjects who are moving from on -demand to prophy laxis. Using 50 IU/kg for PK measurements, subjects in the 071001 study exhibiting a T1/2for rVWF o f 14, 16, or 19 hours had BAX111 plasma concentrations at 72 hours after administration of 2.55, 4.01 ,and 6.49% above baseline, respectivel y, and plasma concentrations at 96 hours after administration of 0.78, 1.40, and 2.71% above baseline, respectivel y. Subjects who have significant spontaneous bleeding while on twice weekl yproph ylaxis will have their regimen increase dto 50IU/kg 3 times per week ( see Section 8.6.4.2). A total of 125 AEs occurred in 25/37 (67.7%) subjects (62/318 infusions [19.5%]) during or after infusion with I P. Of these, 116/125 were non -serious (all mild or moderate; none were severe), and 9 SAEs were reported in 7 subjects. Of 125 total AEs, 38 were temporally associated with I P; 8 AEs were considered causally related to I P: 6 non- serious related AEs (tach ycardia, infusion site paraesthesia, electrocardiogram [ECG ] t-wave inversion, dy sgeusia, generalized pruriti s, and hot flush) occurred in 4 subjects, and 2 related SAEs (chest discomfort and incr eased heart rate) occurred in 1subject. No deaths occurred during this study . None of the subjects developed anti- VWF or anti -FVIII neutral izing antibodies and no binding antibodies to VWF or rFurin, or antibodies against CHO protein or anti -Murine IgG were observed. No clinical or subclinical signs or symptoms of a thrombogenic event were observed in this study. Following an initial increase in ultralarge VWF multimers after administration of rVWF, a notable decrease in the proportion of large VWF multimers occurred between 12 and 24 hours post infusion, due to degradation by the endogenous ADAMTS13 followed b y a continued decline until the e nd of the 96- hour follow -up period.

For the initial rVWF infusion, the subject received a test dose of 5% of the total dose of 60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo at an infusion rate of 1 mL/min. After a 10 to 15 -minute observation period, no adverse s ymptoms or signs were noted and the subject received the remaining 95% of the total dose. The subject was monitored for an y signs of an allergic reaction, and none were noted. Treatment with rVWF every 12 to 24 hours was tocontinue at the discretion of the investigator based on VWF levels and clinical symptomatology . The subject ha d an excellent response and recovery , which allowed for daily dosing of rVWF and, within 24 hours, the subject’s bleeding had stopped. Dail y dosing of rVWF was maintained and the subject received his last dose on . The subject also received rVWF for 7 days for prophy laxis for surgery (surgical resection of a left -kidney mass). The subject experienced no hemorrhagic complications and no AEs that were considered related to the use of rVWF. 6.6Evaluation of Anticipated Risks and Benefits of the In vestigational Product(s) to Human Subjects Current treatment of VWD patients relies on desmopressin and VWF products manufactured from pooled human plasma. Human VWF produced b y recombinant technology could offer a new perspective in treatment of VWD. The benefit for the individual subject is anticipated to be significant during this clinical stud y. He/she may benefit from a product that minimizes excessive FVIII administration. Variations in VWF multimeric composition may lead to variabilit y with respect t o treating or preventing bleeds in VWD subjects, especiall y mucosal bleeds which are especially problematic. rVWF product manufactured by Baxalta consistently contains ultra -large molecular weight (ULMW) VWF multimers due to the fact that the product has n ot been exposed to ADAMTS13. The initial presence of these ULMW VWF multimers, which are subsequently cleaved by the subject’s endogenous ADAMTS13, may result in improved platelet and collagen binding and therefore provide more p redictable treatment outcom es.

If a subject does not adequately respond to rVWF therapy , he/she will be evaluated for the presence of neutralizing and total binding anti- VWF antibodies (see Section 12.9.3.2 ). If a subject experiences a bleed while receiving rVWF three times per week, the investigator should treat the bleed with rVWF at doses up to 80 IU VWF:RCo/kg at a frequency determined by the investigator until the bleed resolves. Upon resolution of the bleeding event, the subject will return to their assigned proph ylaxis regimen. Itis essential for the success of this study that the subjects adhere to treatment regimens . Therefore, procedures for monitoring subject’s compliance are implemented (see Section 10.7) . If 1infusion of IP is missed, the subject may administer the I P as soon as possible .The subject s hould adhere to the irtreatment scheme ensuring a minimum interval of 12 hours between this and the previous I P infusion. For example ,a subject routinel y infuses I P on Monday and Thursday ,he/she misses the Monday time point and therefore may infuse the IP on the next day (Tuesday )and thereafter proceed with infusing the IP on Thursday (considering a minimum 12 hours between the infusions )and return to the initial schedule. If more than 30% of infusions of IP are misse dwithin the visit inte rval of 3 months the subject will be discontinued from the stud y (see Section 9.4). 8.6.4.3.2 General Instructions for Home Treatment forProphylaxis At the discretion of the investigator, a subject may be considered suitable for home treatment only after the subject has received at lea st 1infusion of I Pin the clinic ,either during planned IP exposure (PK or proph ylaxis) or during the treatment of bleeding episodes, and meets the following additional criteria : 1.Fully understands the concept of a clinical study and related documentation (documented training of at least 30 minutes), 2.Has a history of previous experience with home treatment including self-adminis tration and treatment with VWF containing concentrates, 3.Has adequate time for initial training of the stud y drug preparation (preparation, mixing and infusion of the IP(s) (documented tr aining of at least 30 minutes) .

A Subject Guideline detailing all instructions and information listed above will be provided to each subject. 8.6.4.4 Treatment of Bleeding Episodes 8.6.4.4.1 General Instructions for Home Treatment of Bleeding Episodes If a subject experiences a bleeding episode, he/she should contact the study site immediately and the site investigator should provide instructions on the treatment regimen. If the subject initiates the treatment at home, he/she should at least follow up with the study site if avisit is needed as per the standard of care at the center . In the event a healthcare professional is required to administer treatment at the subject’s home, he/she must be trained and qualified b y the site investigator on the above procedures prior to the decision for home treatment. Once a subject has received 1infusion of rVWF in the clinic (either during planned I P exposure or during the treatment o f a bleeding episode) and meets the criteria for home treatment, the treatment of bleeding episodes with I P can be conducted at home (see Section 8.6.4.3.2). If a subject is not qualified for home treatment, rVWF infusions must b e administered at the study site. If a subject experiences a bleeding episode that requires treatment between the screening and the proph ylaxis initiation visit , the subject will be treated with I P (rVWF with or without ADVATE ). Treatment with I P must occur at the study site unless the subject has previously qualified for home treatment with rVWF. If rVWF treatment is not feasible, the subject may use his/her standard of care, such as commercial pdVWF/FVIII products. In any case a washout period of at l east 5 day s is required prior to rVWF PK infusion at the PK assessment visit. If a subject experiences a bleeding episode requiring treatment during the PK assessment, rVWF will be used to treat the bleed. Blood draws for PK assessment will be stopped and the PK assessments will be repeated once the bleed has resolved and the subject is free of any symptoms related with the bleeding episode . Dose and frequency of rVWF infusions or an y other replacement therap y to stop the bleed should be recorded in the e -CRF. For non-commercial use only"

In general i nitially , an infusion of rVWF: ADVATE at anrVWF: ADVATE ratio of 1.3:1± 0.2 will be administered. Subsequent infusions will be with rVWF:RCo 40 to 60 I U/kg with or without 30 to 45 IU/kg ADVATE (only to be administered if plasma FVIII levels fall below 30 IU/L during the treatment period) . If FVIII levels are not available, dosing is at the discretion of the investigator based upon the individual subject’s PK data. Using ADVATE in addition to rVWF in subsequent doses carries the risk of an excessive rise in FVIII:C. Therefore, reduced doses of ADVATE and/or prolongation of the dose int erval should be considered. In general the aim of the initial dose should be full replacement of VWF with VWF:RCo levels of >0 .6IU/ml (60%) and FVIII:C of > 0.4 IU/mL (40%). In major bleeding episodes , subsequent doses should keep the trough level of VWF:RCo >50% for 3 day s and then as deemed necessary by the investigator for subsequent days. In moderate bleeding episodes ,the dose and trough level may be reduced to >30% for as long as deemed necessary by the investigator. Treatment for minor bleeding episodes will generall y consist of onl y 1 or 2 doses of rVWF IP. If the VWF:RCo level is above 150%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 12 hours; if the VWF:RCo level is above 200%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 24 hours . In either case, a lower subsequent dose (e.g., 20 IU/kg VWF:RCo) may be appropriate. Dosing recommendations are listed in Table 3. Dosage must be ind ividualized based on the subject ’s weight, VWD ty pe,and the severit y of the bleeding episode , as well as on monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory measures. In the phase 1 study 070701, 1 .0IU/kg VWF:RCo raised the circulating level of VWF:RCo by 0.017 IU/mL (1.7 %). In the same study , the o bserved mean half -life for rVWF was 19.3 hours, with a st andard deviation of 10.9 hours. For non-commercial use only"

A diagnosis of menorrhagia will be defined by a prospectively completed Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) score > 185 and normal cervical cytology or requiring use of a VWF -containing concentrate for treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding for at least one menstrual cycle during the prior year. Variances of up to 10% in dosing are permissible during treatment of bleeding episodes, but rounding to the nearest vial size should be avoided. Subjects with non- neutralizing binding anti -VWF antibodies should initially be treated with a dose known to be efficacious based on the subject’s medical treatment history which may differ from the recommendations provided in Table 3. Subjects should be monitored for lack of efficacy as well as for FVIII (mandatory ), VWF:RCo (m andatory ), and VWF:Ag (optional where testing is not available) levels after 3 to 6hours. Re -dosing with rVWF in combination with ADVATE using the same (initial) dose and adaptation of the dosing frequency should be considered until cessation of the bleed, if the FVIII and/or VWF:RCo levels drop below 30% -50% depending on b leeding severit y. The number of subsequent infusions and the dosage levels prescribed will be determined by the investigator on the basis of the clinical severity , response to current therapy , available laboratory data, and the subject’s historical treatme nt for similar bleeding episode s.

Major surgeries generally refer to major orthopedic surgery (e.g., joint replacement, arthroscopic or open s ynovectomy , arthrodesis, hardware removals like plates or intramedullary nails, etc.), major abdominal surgery (e.g. open or laparoscopic hernioplasty , cholecy stectomy , colon or small bowel resection, etc.), major gy necological surgery (e.g. open or laparoscopic m yomectom y, hysterectomy, removal of endometriosis, poly ps, cysts, adhesioly sis, etc.), major head and neck surgery (e.g.: tonsillectomy , adenoidectomy , rhinoplast y, lymphadenectomy, th yroidectomy , parotidectom y. etc.), an y intracranial , cardiovascular or spinal surgery and any other surgery which has a significant risk of large volume blood loss or blood loss into a confined anatomical space. Extraction of impacted third molars is generall y also considered major surgery due to the expected difficulty of surgery and the expected blood loss. Minor surgeries generally refer to interventions such as placement of intravenous access devices, removal of small skin lesions, arthroscopy, gastroscop y, colonoscopy or conisation. Oral surgeries comprise extractions of fewer than three teeth, if the teeth are non -molars and have no bon y involvement.

As a general guidance a priming dose of 40 -60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo will be administered . 8.6.4.5.3 Preoperative Loading Dose An rVWF loading dose should be administed within 3 hours before surgery. The preoperative loading dose will be calculated as the difference in the target peak and baseline plasma VWF:RCo levels divided by the IR. For minor and oral surgery , the target peak is 50 -60 IU/dL VWF:RCo and 40- 50 IU/dL FVIII. For major surgery , the target peak is 100IU/d L VWF:RCo and 80 -100 IU/dL FVIII. If FV III levels prior to loading dose administration are not at least 30 IU/dL (minor, oral surgery ), or 60 IU/dL (major surgery ) ADVATE will be administered in addition to rVWF in order to raise FVIII:C levels to recommended levels. The surgery may only start after normalization of the activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT). 8.6.4.5.4 Intra- and Postoperative (maintenance) Dosing After the preoperative loading dose(s), subjects who have not achieved the desired postinfusion recovery will continue to receive rVWF with or without ADVATE as a bolus infusion, depending on VWF and FVIII levels. The peri -and postoperative substitution r egimen will be individualized according to the PK results, intensity and duration of the hemostatic challenge, and the institution’s standard of care. Subjects undergoing minor surgery will be infused with rVWF every 12-24 hours or every other day , targert ing >30IU/dL (rVWF and FVIII) for at least the first 48 hours. Subjects undergoing oral surgery will be infused with rVWF at least once within the f irst 8-12 hours, targeting >30 IU/dL (rVWF and FVIII). Subjects undergoing major surgery will be infused wit h rVWF every 12-24 hours for at least the first 72 hours post -surgery , targeting a VWF:RCo and FVIII:C trough plasma level >50 IU/dL, followed by further treatment post -72 hours for as long as deemed necessary by the Investigator, targeting a VWF:RCo and F VIII:C trough plasma level of >30 IU/dL.

For subsequent infusions post surgery , in case pre -infusion levels are not available prior to the consecutive infusion in a timely manner, pre -infusion levels from the previous dose may be used by the investigator for dosing guidance. Peak plasma level guidance is matching to Section 8.6.4.4.2 A schedule of all perioperative visit assessments and laboratory sampling can be found in supplement t ables in Section 20.2.1 and Section 20.3.1 . 8.6.4.6 Thrombosis Prophylaxis Thromboembolic events have been reported in patients who have VWD, especiall y in the setting of known risk factors for thrombosis. Hence, in all patients who have VWD and are receiving VWF concentrate, attention should be given to avoid exceeding maximal recommended plasma activity levels of VWF :RCo (250 IU/dL) and FVIII (250 IU/dL), perform proper thrombotic -risk assessment, and institute appropriate preventive strategies. Anticoagulation measures, such as heparin, are acceptable and should follow study site standards. The investigator will record the use and reasons for such measures/agents on the appropriate CRF. 8.6.5 Investigational Product Accountability The investigator will ensure that the IP (s)isstored as specified in the Pharmacy Manual and that the st orage area is secured, with access limited to authorized study personnel. The investigator will maintain records that the IP(s)wasreceived, including the date received, drug identit y code, date of manufacture or expiration date, amount received and disposition. The IP(s)must be dispensed only at the study site or other suitable location (e.g.,infusion center; home, as applicable per study design), as specified in the protocol (see Section 10). Records will be maintained that includes the subject identification code (SIC), dispensation date, and amount dispensed. All remaining partially used and/or unused I P(s)will be returned to the sponsor or sp onsor’s representative after study completion/termination, or destro yed with the permission of the sponsor in accordance with applicable laws and study site procedures .

For example, the third subject who signed an informed consent form at stud y site 02 will be identified as Subject 090701- 020003. All study documents (e . g., CRFs, clinical documentation, sample containers, drug accountability logs, etc.) will be identified with the SI C. Additionally , a uniquely coded SI C(s) is permitted as long as it does not contain a combination of information that allows identification of a subject (e.g., collection of a subject’s initials and birth date would not be permitted), in compliance with laws governing data privacy . 10.3 Screening and Study Visits The study site is responsible for maintaining a screening log that includes all subjects who provided informed consent . The log also will serve to document the reason for screening failure. All screening data will be collected and reported in CRFs, regardless of screening outcome. If a subje ct is re -screened, the End of Study CRF should be completed, and a new ICF, new SIC and new CRF are required for that subject. The overall study design is illustrated in the Figure 1. Details on the pro cedures to be performed at each stud y visit, including screening, are provided in Supplement 20.2 Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments and Supplement 20.3 Clinical Laboratory Assessments. 10.3.1 Scre ening V isit Written informed consent must b e obtained from each subject before an y study related procedures are performed. To initiate screening procedures, at least 72 hours must have elapsed since the last VWF administration and the subject must not be actively bleeding at the time of screening. Multimer analy sis and VWD gene mutation analysis should be performed at screening if not available in the subject’s medical history . The screening visit will be delay ed if the subjects presents with an acute bleed ing episodes or acute illness (e.g.,influe nza, flu -likesymptoms, inflammatory diseases) until the event has resolved.

If the IP is not infused within 42days, allscreening assessments except blood group, human leucocy te antigen ( HLA ), genetics , multimeric pattern and ,must be repeated to reconfirm eligibility . Refer to Supplement 20.2 and Supplement 20.3.Upon completion of screening procedures, subject eligibility will be confirmed by the sponsor on a subject eligibility form before additional study procedures are undertaken. The subject will maintain a diary that will include infusion logs (see Section 10.5). The allocation of IP will be initiated after the subject has qualified for home treatment (see Section 8.6.4.3.2 ). In the event of a subject experienc inga bleeding episode that requires treatment between the screening visit and the baseline visit (PK assessment visit), the subject willbe treated with rVWF. If rVWF is not available for any reason , e.g., subject not yet trained on IP administration, study site visit for I P administration not feasible, etc ., the subject may use his/her standard of care, such as commercial pdVWF/FVIII products . 10.3.2 Baseline Vi sit -PK-Assessment V isit After screening and confirmation of eligibility each subject will undergo a PK assessmen t . All subjects will receive a dose of 50 ± 5 IU/kg rVWF:RCo to determine VWF and FVIII levels. Blood samples will be drawn within 30 minutes pre-infusion, and at 11 time points post -infusion ( 15 ± 5 minutes, 30 5 minutes, 60 5 minutes, 3 ± 0.5 hours, 6 0.5hours, 12  0.5hours, 24 0.5hours, 30 ± 2 hours, 48 2 hours, 722hours and 96 ± 2 hours). See Section 20.2 and Section 20.3. IP infusion vials from the same lot number should be used for all PK-assessments per subject . Samples for measurement of FVIII and VWF activity taken through to 6hours post -infusion will be obtained from an extremity different from th at used for the infusion of IP. Where needed, the phlebotomy site will be kept patent via an infusion of normal saline. In this event, at least 5 mL of blood will be collected and discarded before collection of the next test sample into a fresh s yringe. If the subject has a central venous catheter, the central line should be used to administer the infusion and a peripheral venipuncture should be used to collect the blood samples. Inthe event that a blood sample must be drawn through the central line used for administration of I P, the line must first be flushed with at least 10 mL normal sa line or other suitable catheter flush solution that does not contain anticoagulant. At least 5 mL of whole blood must be collected and discarded prior to obtaining the sample. For non-commercial use only"

The following details on bleeding episodes will be recorded b y the subject in the electronic diary (for home treatment), the subject’s healthcare provider in the site’s source documents (for treatments away from the primary investiga tive site), or b y authorized, qualified personnel at the participating site in the subject’s medical records (for hospital -based treatment): Location of bleed; i.e., joint, menorrhagia, epistaxis, gastrointestinal, soft tissue, muscle, body cavit y, intracr anial, etc. Type of bleed; i.e., spontaneous, traumatic, unknown Severity of bleed; i.e.,minor, moderate, and major (see Table 3) Date and time of ons et of bleed Date and time of each infusion of rVWF or rVWF -ADVATE used to treat a bleeding episode Date and time of resolution of the bleeding episode Study site personnel are qualified after they have under gone training during the qualification of the site. All ty pes of bleeds, including tra umatic bleeds, will be recorded. Bleeding episodes should be organized by where they occur in addition to whether they occurred spontaneously or due to a traumatic event. Bleeds occurring at the same anatomical locat ion (e.g., right knee) with the same etiology (i.e., spontaneous versu s injury ) within 24 hours after onset of the first bleed will be considered a single bleed. Bleeding occurring at multiple locations related to the same injury (e.g., knee and ankle bleeds following a fall) will be counted as a single bleeding episode. All efforts should be made to use rVWF for treatment of bleeding episodes. If needed , the use of a VWF concentrate other than IPfor the treatment of bleeding episodes will not disqualify the subject from further participation in the study . For non-commercial use only"

An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign ( e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom (e. g., rash, pain, discomfort, fever, dizziness, etc.) , disease (e.g., peritonitis, bacteremia, etc.),or outcome of death temporally associated with the use of an IP, whether or not considered causall y related to the I P. 12.1.1.1 Serious Adverse Event A nSAE is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose meets one or more of the following criteria: Outcome is fatal/results in death (including fetal death) Is life -threatening – defined as an event in which the subject was, in the judgment of the investigator, at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that h ypotheticall y might have caused death had it bee n more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization –inpatient hospitalization refers to any inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay . Results in persistent or significant disability /incapac ity (i.e.,a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) Is acongenital anomal y/birth defect Is a medicall y important event –a medical event t hat may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or require hos pitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definitions above. Examples of such events are: Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood d yscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependence or drug abuse Reviewed and confirmed seroconversion for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), or parvovirus B19 (B19V) For non-commercial use only"

However, when there is an increase in the severit y, duration, or frequency of a preexisting disease, the event must be described on the AE CRF. 12.1.2 Assessment of Adverse Events For the purposes of this study , the following will not be considered as AEs and will not be included in the analy sis of AEs. Bleeding episodes are part of the underl ying disease and therefore are not AEs; they will be evaluated in the context of efficacy . For non -serious bleeding episode scaused b y an injury, the injury would not be reported as an AE, unless it resulted in a medical finding other than a bleeding episode (e.g., abrasion of ski n). Therefore, any VWD -related bleeding event (e.g., epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, musculo -skeletal bleeding, menorrhagia) that is non -serious will not be reported as an AE. However, the investigator may decide that the event is an AE if the event also would have occurred in a healthy individual under the same circumstances. For SAEs: Bleeding events that meet seriousness criteria (death, life-threatening, hospitalizing/prolongation of hospitalization, disability , congenital anomal y, or medicall y significant and if not urgently treated would result in one of the above) should be reported on the S AE eCRF or SAE Report form as a n SAE . Seroconversion after documented HAV/HBV vaccination prior to or during the study period. Each AE from the first IP exposure to the study completion date will be described on the AE CRF using the medical diagnosis (pref erred), or, if no diagnosis could be established at the time of reporting the AE, a symptom or sign, in standard medical terminology in order to avoid the use of vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions (see definition in Section 12.1). Each AE will be evaluated b y the investigator for: Seriousness as defined in Section 12.1.1.1 Severity as defined in Section 12.1.2.1 Causal relationship to I P exposure or study procedure as defined in Section 12.1.2.2 For non-commercial use only"

Recovering/resolving AEs will be followed until resolution . If the severity rating for an ongoing AE changes before the event resolves, the original AE report will be revised (i.e., the event will not be reported as separate AE). During the course of an y AE, the highest severit y rating will be reported. Deviations from the protocol -specified dosage (including underdosing /overdosi ng [<20 IU/kg rVWF:RCo or > 100rVWF:RCo], abuse, and withdrawal, treatment errors (including incorrect route of administration, use of an incorrect produ ct, and deviations from the protocol -defined dosing schedule), failures of expected pharmacological actions, and unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefits will be followed with regard tooccurrence of AEs, lack of efficacy , and/or other observations beca use these events may be reportable to regulatory authorities. Any pregnancy that occurs after administration of IP will be reported on a Pregnancy Form and followed- up at 1 y ear post- delivery , if feasible. If an investigator becomes aware of an SAE occur ring in a subject after study completion, the SAE must be reported on the SAE Form within 24 hours after awareness: no additional reporting on CRFs is necessary . 12.1.2.1 Severity The investigator will assess the severit y of each AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment based on the most appropriate description below: Mild The AE is a transient discomfort and does not interfere in a significant manner with the subject’s normal functioning level. The AE resolves spontaneously or may require minimal therapeutic intervention. Moderate The AE produces limited impairment of function and may require therapeutic intervention. The AE produces no sequela/sequelae.

These severity definitions will also be used to assess the severity of an AE with a study- related procedure(s), if necessary . 12.1.2.2 Causality Causal ity is a determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the I P is etiologicall y related to/associated with the AE. Causality assessment includes, e .g., assessment of temporal relationships, dechallenge/rechallenge information, association (or lack of association) with underly ing disease, presence (or absence) of a more likely cause, and ph ysiological plausibility . For each AE, the investigator will assess the causal relationship between the IP and the AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment according to the following most appropriate algorithm for the circumstances of the AE: Not related (both circumstances must be met) Is due to underl ying or concurrent illness, complications, concurrent treatments, or effects of concurrent drugs Is not associated with the I P (i.e., does not follow a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of I P or has a much more likel y alternative etiology ). Unlikely related (either 1 or both circumstances are met) Has little or no temporal relationship to the I P A more likely alternative etiology exists Possibly related (both circumstances must be met) Follows a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of I P An alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the potential relationship to the I P Probably related (both circumstances must be met) Follows a strong temporal relationship to the administration of I P, which may include but is not limited to the following: For non-commercial use only"

These causality definitions will also be used to assess the relatio nship of an AE with a study -related procedure(s), if necessary. 12.1.2.3 Safety Reporting Adverse events/SAEs will be assessed at all study visits as outlined in the Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments (see Table 6) and Section 12.1.2. Adverse Events/SAEs are to be recorded on the AE page of the e CRF. Each event should be recorded separatel y. Any SAE, including death due to any cause, which occurs during this study , whether or not related to the investigational product, must be reported immediatel y (within 24 hours of the study center’s first knowl edge of the event). All SAEs must be reported via the Electronic Data Capture (EDC) s ystem by completing the relevant eCRF page(s) in English. For instances in which the EDC may become unavailable, SAEs must be reported using the back - up paper SAE r eport (SAER) form to meet the 24 -hour timeline requirement (for contacts an d instructions refer to the SAER form). Once the EDC becomes available, the site must enter all SAE data as re ported on the back -up paper SAER form on the applicable eCRF pages.

However, the same method should be used for all measurements in 1 subject. Vital signs (pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure) should be recorded within 30 min before and after IP administration. The assessment of vital signs per planned study visit is outlined in Supplement 20.2. Vital sign values are to be recorded on the ph ysical examination eCRF. For each vital sign value, the investigator will determine whether the value is considered an AE (see definition in Section 12.1). If assessed as an AE, the medical diagnosis (preferabl y), symptom, or sign, will be recorded on the AE eCRF. Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or etiology ofan abnormal result, or to monitor the course of an AE, should be obtained when clinicall y indicated.

In general all laboratory tests will be performed at central laboratories , except the pregnancy and blood group test which will be performed at the local laboratory .In addition, relevant critical safet y laboratory tests for complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry and/or coagulation parameters such as VWF and FVIII activity may also be performed in the local laboratory to ensure that results will be available immediately to the investigator. In principle, results from the central laboratory will be used for data analysis purposes. The assay s performed in the central laboratories are specified in the Laboratory Manual. The i nvestigator will supply the sponsor with a list of the normal ranges and units of measurement for the laboratory variables to be determined at the site. Laboratory values such as antibodies to other proteins are not required immediately and will be assessed later during the course of the study. Abnormal laboratory values deemed clinically significant by the investigator are to be recorded as AEs (see Section 12.1.2). 12.9.1 rVWF and E ndogenous FVIII Pharmacokinetics PK assessments using a dose of 50 IU±5 IU/kg rVWF:RCo will be performed at the baseline visit. If the subject is on on-demand treatment and has received VWF replacement therap y a washout period of at least 5 daysis required before the infusion of rVWF for PK assessment can be administered. Blood samples will be drawn within 30 minutes pre-infusion, and at 11time points post-infusion ( 15 ± 5 minutes, 305 minutes, 60 5 minutes, 3 ± 0.5 hours, 60.5hours, 12  0.5hours, 24 0.5hours, 30 ± 2 hours, 48 2 hours, 72 2hours and 96 ± 2 hours) VWF activity will be determined using the VWF:RCo , VWF:CB and the VWF: Ag assay . Endoge nous FVIII activity will be measured using the 1 -stage clotting assay . At the 12 month ± 2 week visit, a full PK analy sis will also be performed.

Testing will be done prior to I P infusion and with at least a 72hour wash out period since the last I P infusion. If there is any suspicion of inhibitor development (e.g. excessive bleeding) binding and neutralizing antibodies to VWF and FVIII may be tested at the discre tion of the investigator. 12.9.3.2 Neutralizing and Total Binding Anti -VWF Antibodies The assay s to establish the presence of neutralizing and total binding anti -VWF antibodies have been established in the absence of international standards and with only limited n umbers of positive controls. Therefore, caution is advised in interpreting positive results. I n particular, any clinical association, changes in the natural history of the disease, effect of therapy, etc. needs to be taken into account for final judgment. Thesponsor’s Medical Director should be consulted for additional advice. As part of the AE follow -up, an y sample testing positive needs to be confirmed after 2 -4 weeks for central laboratory testing. Only confirmed neutralizing anti -VWF antibodies are considered inhibitors (see Section 12.9.3.4) . These subjects need to be closely monitored and therap y adjusted accordingl y. 12.9.3.3 Binding antibodies to VW F The presence of total binding anti -VWF antibodies will be determined by an enzy me- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) employ ing poly clonal anti -human Immunoglobulin (Ig)antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA). For this assay (ELI SA), recombinant human VWF will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then incubated with dilutions of the positive control, the negative control or test sample. Antibodies against human VWF that are present in the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) - coupled goat anti- human antibody (secondary antibody ). The positive control for this assay will be a human monoclonal antibody specific for human VWF spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human plasma. Plasma samples are analy zed for binding antibodies against the specific antigen in two steps. First, the sample is screened for antibodies and the titer of binding antibodies is determined. Second, the specificit y of positive antibody results is c onfirmed.16 Inbrief, all samples are serially diluted (initial dilution 1:20 and further diluted 1:2). For non-commercial use only"

The cut off level is established based on background signal level of healthy plasma donors (n=160) and set to include 5% false positives to be as sensitive as possible (95% percentile). The ELISA assay is validated allowing a nassay variability of ± 1 titer step. Therefore, differences ≤ 2 titers steps may be due to variability of the ELISA assay. Specificity has to be confirmed in a competition assay when a sample has a titer of 1:80 or higher in the screening assay . Based on the validation criteria samples tested in the screening assay at 1:20 or 1:40 cannot be confirmed in the competition assay . A positive screening value is confirmed if the difference between the titers determined for the subjec t sample (re -screen) and for the subject sample with pre -incubation (confirmation sample) is > 2 titer steps. Antibody titers of subject samples will only be reported as positive, if the results of the screening and confirmatory anal ysis fulfill these acce ptance criteria. The titer to be reported is alway s the one determined in the original screening procedure (independent of the result of the re -screening in the confirmation procedure). A more detailed test procedure will be supplied upon request or pro -actively if a sample tests positive. A treatment related increase of the binding anti -VWF antibodies is expected, if the titer increases by more than 2 titration steps. These subjects need to be closely monitored and therapy adjusted accordingly . 12.9.3.4 Neutralizi ng A ntibodies to VWF Three functional VWF assay s, collagen binding (VWF:CB) assay , Ristocetin cofactor (VWF:RCo) and FVIII binding (VWF:FVIIIB), will be used to test for the presence of neutralizing anti-VWF antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies to VWF:RCo, VWF:CB and VWF:FVIIIB activities will be measured b y assay s based on the Bethesda assay established for quantitative anal ysis of FVIII inhibitors (Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay ).17The amount of inhibitor is expressed as Bethesda units (BU) per mL. One BU is thereb y defined as the amount of inhibitor that decreases the measured activity in the assay s to 50% of that of the negative control samples. The assay s were validated using human plasma samples from two ty pe 3 VWD patients with low (1 -2 BU/mL) a nd high (~10 BU/mL) titer inhibitors and plasma samples from non -human primates immunized with human rVWF (>100 BU/mL) If a subject has a measurable baseline level of VWF activity in the respective assay , it is taken into account in the calculation of the residual activity . However, if baseline levels are too high (>15% VWF:RCo), inhibitors may not be reliabl y detected. For non-commercial use only"

The rationale for this cut-off value is the relativel y high CIof the underl ying assay s, making determinations at the end of the evaluation range of the Bethesda reference curve uncertain.18 A more detailed test procedure may be requested to further characterize the anti -VWF inhibitors, if detected. 12.9.3.5 Binding Antibodies to FVIII Binding antibodies against FVIII will be anal yzed using a proprietary enzyme immunoassay . The testing strategy will be as described for binding anti -VWF antibodies. Antibody -containing samples will be identified in a screening assay followed by a confirmat ory assay to exclude false positive results. 12.9.3.6 Neutralizing Antibodies (I nhibitors) to FVIII Neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to FVIII will be assessed b y the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay in a central laboratory . To verify a FVIII inhibit or, additional testing (such as tests for L upus anticoagulants) may be initiated. Positive FVIII inhibitor tests will be defined as ≥ 0.4 BU b y the Nijmegen -modified Bethesda assay that is confirmed b y a second test performed on an independent sample obtai ned 2 -4 weeks following the first test. Only confirmed positive FVIII inhibitor test result will be reported as an SAE. 12.9.4 Antibodies to Other Proteins Plasma will be assay ed for the presence of antibodies against CHO protein (total Ig), murine IgG and human Furin (total Ig) using proprietary enzy me immunoassay s.

Antibody -containing samples will be identified in a screening assay followed by a confirmatory assay to exclude false positi ve results. 12.9.4.1 Anti -CHO Protein Total Ig antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM) against CHO protein will be anal yzed. For this assay (ELISA), CHO protein derived from cultures of untransfected cells and propagated under the identical cell culture conditions used for ADVA TE production will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then incubated with dilutions of the positive control, negative control or test sample. Antibodies against CHO protein that are present in the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -coupled goat anti-human antibody (secondary antibody ).

M icrotiter plates coated with mouse IgG will be incubated with dilutions of the standard, the positive control, the negative control or the test sample. Antibodies against mouse IgG that are present in thesamples bind to the coated antigen and form a bridg e to a peroxidase coupled mouse IgGantibody that will be used for detection (bridging format of the ELISA assay ). Thepositive control for this assay will be a poly clonal goat anti-murine IgG spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human plasma. 12.9.4.3 Antibodies to H uman Furin Total Ig antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM) against human Furin will be anal yzed. For this assay (ELISA), recombinant human Furin will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then incubated with dilutions of the positive control, the negative control or test sample. Antibodies against human Furin that are present in the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled goat anti- human antibody (secondary antibody ). The positive control for this assay will be a human monoclonal antibody specific for human Furin spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human plasma. 12.9.5 Viral Serology The following vir al seromarkers wil l be assessed at screening: HIV: anti -HIV 1, HIV 2 HAV: anti -HAV (IgG and immunoglobulin M [IgM]) HBV: Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg ), anti -Hepatitis B ( HB)core, anti -HBs HCV: anti -HCV ELI SA Parvovirus B19: anti -B19V (IgG and IgM) Virus serology will be established during the screening period.

If no urine sample is available, the pregnancy testing will be done from serum. The pregnancy test may need to be repeated during the course of study in countries where mandated b y national law. 12.9.8 VWD Mutational Analysis , Multimer Analysis and Human Leukocyte Antigen Genotyping A cell pellet (buffy coat and ery throcy tes) will be retained at the screening visit for VWD gene mutational analy sis,VWF multimer analy sis and HLA genot ype determination if the information is not already available in the subject’s medical history . Results from multimer analy sis(see Section 12.9.10.1) may contribute to VWD gene mutation al analysis. The genetic testing will be done, when the subject consents to the genetic testing. 12.9.9 Blood Group Analysis The blood group needs to be determined during the screening period. If the information is not alread y available in the subject’s medical history , it has to be determined at the local lab. 12.9.10 Additional Laboratory Testing in C ase of Thrombo embolic Events rVWF contains ultra large molecular weight (ULMW) multimers because of a lack of exposure to endogenous VWF protease ( a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin ty pe 1 motif, member 13 ( ADAMTS13) during the manufacturing process. In vitro and in vivo cleavage of these ultralarge molecular fractions by ADAMTS13 and generation of characteristic satellite bands has been extensively demonstrated during nonclinical and clinical development. Nevertheless, the potential elevated risk of thrombosis and/or other thromboembolic complications due to the administration of ultra large molecular VWF multimers in subjects with normal levels of VWF cannot be completely excluded. Therefore VWF multimer analy sis will not only be performed routinel y at screening but i n case of thrombo embolic events both VWF multimer ana lysis as well as ADAMTS13 activit y will be determined to assess an y relatedness of these occurrences with I P treatment.

High -resolution SDS –agarose gel electrophoresis, with agarose concentrations 1.5%, will be used to determine the satellite band structure of VWF. These anal yses will employ Western blot with luminescence video imaging. 12.9.10.2 ADAMTS13 Activity VWF73 was identified as the 73 amino acid minimal region of the VWF A2 domain required for ADAMTS13 cleavage. The cleavage of this substrate will be detected b y a commerciall y available ELISA -based Chromogenic assay (Technoclone Austria): Cleavage of immob ilized VWF73 substrate is detected by a HRP -labeled antibody directed against the cleavage site of VWF73. The amount of bound antibody, which is the function of the ADAMTS13 cleavage is detected by a chromogenic substrate . 12.9.11 Soluble P -Selectin (sP -Selectin) sP-selectin is a cell adhesion molecule (CAM) found in granules in endothelial cells (cells lining blood vessels) and activated platelets. Data for an association between the sP-selectin concentration, thrombotic thrombocy topenic purpura (TTP)and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are limited and the predictive value has not yet established. Acommercial ELISA assay will be employ ed as an exploratory test. sP -selectin will be determined at the Screening visit and used as indicator for an increased thromb otic risk. 12.9.12 D- Dimer D-dimer will be used as a marker for DVT and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) . While a negative result practically rules out thrombosis, a positive result can indicate thrombosis but does not rule out other potential etiologi es, including a recent hemorrhage. Its main use, therefore, is to exclude thromboembolic disease where the probability is low. D -Dimer will be measured at the Screening visit and used as indicator for an increased thrombotic risk. 12.9.13 Additional Laboratory Tes ting in C ase of Severe Hypersensitivity R eactions If a subject develops a severe hypersensitivity reaction in the course of the clinical study ,additional blood dr aws for anti-VWF IgE antibody testing will be drawn. The presence of anti -VWF IgE will be determined b y using the ImmunoCAP®, a VWF - specific IgE blood test (Thermo Scientific).

Each other laboratory value (except results to determine genetics of the underly ing VWD disease and blood group) has to be assessed b y the investigator and the assessment willbe recorded on the e CRF . The investigator will determine for each abnormal laboratory value whether the value is considered clinically significant or not . For clinically significant values, the investigator will indicate if the value constitutes a newAE (see definition in Section 12.1) and record the sign, s ymptom, or medical diagnosis on the AE CRF , is a sy mptom or related to a previousl y recorded AE, is due to a pre -existing disease (described in Section 12.1.1.5), or is due to another issue that will be specified. If the abnormal value was not clinically significant, the investigator will indicate the reason, i .e.because it is due to a preexisting d isease, due to a lab error, due to variation or due to another issue that will be specified. A dditional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significa nce or etiology of an abnormal value , or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtaine d when clinically indicated. Any abnormal value that persists should be followed at the discretion of the investigator.

In cases of major bleeding episodes, a dose of up to 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo may be infused. Subsequent doses, if necessary, will be administered with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) to maintain VWF:RCo and FV III levels for as long as deemed necessary by the investigator. Mode of Adm inistration: intravenous SUBJECT SELECTION Targeted Accrual Approximately 22 adult subjects with severe VWD will be included to have ≥8subjects in each cohort (OD and switch) .

BACKGROUND INFORMATIO N 6.1 Description of Investigational Product Baxalta US Inc. (here after referred to as Baxalta or sponsor) has developed a human recombinant von Willebrand Factor (rVWF , vonicog alpha ), which is co -expressed with recombinant factor VIII (r FVIII )in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line and separ ated during the subsequent downstream process. To address concerns regarding the risk of transmission of blood -bornepathogens that may be introduced by human plasma, no exogenousl y added raw mater ials of human or animal origin are employed in the cell culture, purification, or formulation of the final container product. The only proteins present in the final container product other than rVWF (vonicog alfa) are trace quantities of murine immunoglobu lin (IgG, from the immunoaffinity purification), host cell (i .e., CHO) protein, rFurin (used to further process rVW F). rVWF (vonicog alfa) is intended for the treatment of von Willebrand disease (VWD). rVWF (vonicog alfa) has been developed under the Baxalta internal code BAX111 and is used as investigational product (I P) in this study . rVWF (vonicog alfa) may be used with or without ADVATE (rFVIII , octocog alfa ) for the treatment of bleeding episodes (see Section 8.6.4.4). See Section 8.6for further information on the I Ps and their usage in this study . A detailed description of rVWF (vonicog alfa) is also provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) . rVWF (vonicog alfa) was granted licensure in the United States in Dec ember 2015 under the brand name VONVENDI for the on- demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes in adults diagnosed with VWD ; as of the date of this protocol VONVENDI is not y et available on the market. 6.2Clinical Condition/Indication Von Willebrand Factor ( VWF )is a large multimeric gl ycoprotein with a molecular weight that varies from 500 to 20,000 kDa. VWF is normally found in plasma and produced in the alpha -granules of platelets and in endothelial cell organelles known as the Weibel -Palade bodies. VWF mediat es platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular injury , one of the key functions in primary hemostasis. VWF also serves to stabilize coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), where FVIII is an essential cofactor of secondary hemostasis, which leads to fibrin clot formation.2Qualitative and/or quantitative deficiencies of VWF lead to a highl y variable bleeding diathesis known as VWD, the most common of the hereditary coagulation factor deficiencies. Penetrance of VWD is highly variable, with only a small fraction of mildly affected patients display ing clinical sy mptoms or a family history of a bleeding diathesis. For non-commercial use only"
462,page_462,"rVWF Page 25of 144 Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: 071301 2018 MAR 12 BAX ALTA CONFIDENTIAL –RESTRICTED: DO NOT D ISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PR IOR APPROVALThe current biochemical -based classification distinguishes disorders arising from partial quantitative (ty pe 1), qualitative (ty pe 2), or virtually complete (t ype 3) d eficiencies of VWF. Up to 70% of VWD patients are diagnosed with ty pe 1 VWD, which may also be associated with minor functional defects in the molecule. In general, patients with ty pe 1 VWD display mild clinical sy mptoms. Approximately 20 to 30% of VWD pat ients are diagnosed with ty pe 2 VWD. Ty pe 2 VWD is further divided into 4 subty pes (A, B, N, and M), reflecting distinct classes of functional abnormalities. These defects result in abnormal functional and/or multimeric distribution patterns that facilitat e their diagnosis. The bleeding diathesis is usually moderate and primarily affects the mucosal tissues. Type 2N VWD patients are sometimes misdiagnosed as mild hemophilia A. Finally , approximately 1% percent of VWD patients exhibit a total or near total a bsence of VWF, which is classified as t ype 3 VWD. The incidence of ty pe 3 VWD is estimated at 0.5-1.0 x 106. This ty pe is also associated with a ve ry low FVIII level (t ypically <5%) because the VWF carrier function for FVIII is lost. Replacement of VWF alo ne stabilizes endogenous FVIII, resulting in hemostatic levels withi n several hours post -infusion. Published results from studies of a plasma- derived VWF (pdVWF) concentrate demonstrated an increase of FVIII at an approximate rate of 5.8 1 IU dL-1h-1.3Type 3 VWD patients display severe hemorrhagic s ymptoms with bleeding predominantly in mucosal tissues, muscle and joints. All VWD patients, particularl y those with ty pe 2 or type 3 VWD, are at an increased risk for life -threatening bleeding episodes. 6.3The Role of Prophylaxis in the M anagement of VWD The goals of long term prophy laxis in VWD are to maintain VWF and FVIII at sufficient levels to reduce the frequency and duration of bl eeding episodes, the need for red blood cell transfusions, and the risk of complications, such as arthropath y.4In contrast to hemophilia ,routine prophy laxis is not as established in VWD , although prophy laxis for patients with severe VWD was in use in Sweden alread y during the 1950s .5In those earl y days of VWD treatment, plasma FVIII concentrates containing VWF fractions were applied for replacement therap y,which then were followed by plasma derived VWF products containing fractions of FVIII (pdVWF/FVIII). A Swedish cohort including 37 patients with t ype 3 VWD under proph ylactic median treatment of 11 years (range 2 to 45 years) was retr ospectivel y anal yzed.6,7The doses used for proph ylaxis,given once weekly for at least 45 weeks per y ear, were calculated based on 12 to 50 IU/ kgbody weight (BW)of FVIII clotting activity (FVIII:C ) which approxim ately corresponded to 24 -100 IU/kg von Willebrand factor: Ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:R Co)considering that mainly Haemate with a known VWF:RCo/FVIII:C ratio of about 2 was used. An escalation of doses from 1to 3dose levels was allowed depending on the frequency and severit y of bleeding episodes . For non-commercial use only"

Whereas the median value for bleeds per year was about 10 be fore prophy laxis this value could be reduced to less than 1 bleed per year during prophy laxis. The benefit of proph ylaxis for such indications was retrospectivel y also demonstrated in a cohort of Italian patients including t ype 3, 2A, 2M and type 1 patient s. Prophy laxis was started after sever egastrointestinal or joint bleeding episodes and completely prevented bleeding episodes in 8 of these 11 patients and largely reduced the need of blood transfusions in the remaining 3. A regimen of 40 IU rVWF:RCo/kg was applied every other day or twice a week. A prospective study on prophy laxis, the PRO.WILL study , has been initiated in I taly.8 The results of a prospective study investigating the prophy laxis inchildren and young adults showed a significantly reduced bleeding frequency and bleeding score ( 3vs. 0.07; 3 vs. 0. p<0.001) compared to the pre- prophy laxis values. The median dose was 40(20-47) IU /kgVWF:RCo administered mainly twice weekly in 23 patients , 3 times a week in 7 patients and 4times a week in 2 children .9 The VWD Prophy laxis Network initiated the VWD Intern ational Proph ylaxis (VI P) trial to investigate the role of prophy laxis in patients with severe VWD including Ty pe 1, 2 , and3. The dose of the factor replaceme nt product was 50 IU /kgVWF:RCo. The frequency of the dose depended on the t ype of bleeding and could be increased from once weekl y to twice weekl y or3times per week. For the treatment of menorrhagia the dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo was given on the first day of m enses for 2 cy cles. The f requency could be increased to D ay 1 and 2 for 2 cy cles or to Day 1, 2, and 3 of menses . The study contains both retrospective and prospective study components. Results from theretrospective study component were published, including 61 subjects on prophy lactic regimen in the past 6 months prior to enrollment or subjects with a history of prophy laxis over at least 6 month .10Differences in annualized bleeding rates (ABR) within individuals (during prophylaxis – before proph ylaxis) were significant for those with primary indications of epistaxis (P = 0.0005), joint bleeding (P = 0.002) and GI bleeding (P = 0.001). The difference in the group whose primary indication for treatment was abnormally heavy bleeding at menstruation (n = 4) was not significant (P = 0.25). The reduction of mucosal bleeding likel y not onl y dependen tson normal circulating levels of active VWF, but also on th e presence of discrete concentrations of normal VWF inside the platelets and within endothelial matrices. The low subject number (n=4) and the treatment scheme for menorrhagia on Days 1, 2, and 3 of menses which might represent rather on-demand than prophy lactic treatment may also account for the outcome in this study .

Six subjects had ty pe 2A, and 5subjects had ty pe 3 VWD. Sixsubjects presented with epistaxis, 3 with GI bleeding, and 2with joint bleeding. Seven subjects had dose escalation above the first level. Among the 10 subjects with evaluable bleeding log data, the use of prophy laxis decreased the median ABR from 25 to 6.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] of the rate difference: -51.6 to -1.7), and the median ABR was even lower (4.0; 95% CI: -57.5 to - 5.3) when the subjects reached their final dosing level. The authors concluded that this was the first prospective study to demonstrate that proph ylaxis with VWF concentrates is highl y effective in reducing mucosal and joint bleeding rates in clinicall y severe VWD. The results of the VI P study and previous investigations suggest that VWD patients with recurrent bleeding episodes and severe menorrhagia will benefit from a proph ylactic VWF replacement therapy . There is evidence that up to 40% of patients with ty pe 3 VWD experience joint bleeding which can lead to hemophilic arthropath y. Other potential indications for prophy laxis include patients with ty pe 2A or 2B VWD with recur rent gastrointestinal bleeding, menorrhagia or frequent epistaxis.4Long-term prophy laxis for most patients with ty pe 3 VWD and in some patients with ty pe 1 or 2VWD, depending on t he pattern of bleeding, may be the treatment option of choice . Although the main experience with long -term prophy laxis is with secondary prophy laxis, primary proph ylaxis starting at young age is recommended to prevent art hropathy in patients with severe VW D.12 However, further studies are needed to develop ev idence -based guidelines for prophy lactic treatment in VWD. 6.4Population sto be Studied A total of approximately 22eligible , adult subjects with severe VWD (baseline VWF:RCo <20 IU/dL) are planned to be enrolled . Two cohorts of patients will be included : patients currently receiving on -demand VWF treatment (OD subjects) and patients currentl y on prophylactic treatment with pdVWF (pdVWF switch subjects) , and the aimis to have ≥8 subjects in each of the 2 cohorts, with a total of at least 5 type 3 VWD subje ctsfollowed for 12 months. Enrolled subjects (i .e., subjects who have signed the informed consent form) will be eligible to participate in the study if they meet all of the inclusion criteria (see Section 9.1) and none of the exclusion criteria (see Section 9.2).

Potential risks and efficacy of rVWF (vonicog alfa) :ADVATE (rFV III, octocog alfa) are summarized in the following sections. For additional information on nonclinical and clinical Phase 1 results refer to the rVWF (vonicog alfa) IB. 6.5.1 Findings from Nonclinical Studies 6.5.1.1 Primary Pharmacodynamics Efficacy of rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was shown in VWD animal models, which have also low endogenous FVIII levels. Time to occlusion and stable th rombus formation was asse ssed in the carotid occlusion m odel in VWD mice. The results demonstrated that rVWF (vonicog alfa) in combination with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) acted efficientl y in a dose -depend ent manner and had higher efficacy than rVWF (vonicog alfa) alone or plasma derived ( pd)VWF. These results were confirmed in an additional study assessing blood loss and survival in a tail tip bleeding model in VW D mice . In a VWD dog , rVWF (vonicog alfa) stabilized canine FVIII in the circulation and significa ntly reduced the bleeding time. 6.5.1.2 Safety Pharmacology The anaph ylactoid and thrombogenic potential of the co -infusion of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) and rVWF (vonicog alfa) and the co- infused product’s effects on blood pressure, cardiac and respiratory function and parameters of coagulation activation were investigated in 4 in vivo studies in different animal model s.Safety pharma cology studies in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits ,and dogs revealed no risks for anaph ylactoid and thrombogenic potential of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in combination with rVWF (vonicog alfa) . All observations in safety pharmacology studies are considered to lie within the biological variability of animal models or occurred due to known species - specific anaph ylactoid effects of excipients.

Human rVWF (vonicog alfa) stabilized the endogenous FVIII in VWD mice, VWD pigs ,and VWD dogs. Furthermore, the hypotheses that the area under the curve ( AUC )with rVWF alone and rVWF+ ADVATE is not inferior to the AUC with pdVWF (Haemate P) was tested and confirmed statistically in normal rats. ThePK characteristics of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) were not affect ed by co- administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa) in cy nomolgus monkey s. The PK data in the FVIII knock out (k.o.) mice model are inconclusive and might not be relevant for the clinical situation. However, a stabilizing effect of VWF on FVIII could be shown i n a double k.o. model in a dose depend ent manner. 6.5.1.4 Toxicology Single dose toxicity studies were conducted in C57BL/6J -mice, VWD mice, rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkeys. Rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkey s showed no signs of toxicity . Signs of microthrombosis, an exaggerated pharmacological effect, were observed in mice. Mice are not capable of sufficiently cleaving the rVWF (vonicog alfa) subunit as murine disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombos pondin ty pe 1 motif, number 13 (ADAMTS13 )does not decrease the ultra -large molecular weight multimers of rVWF (vonicog alfa) .13The observed symptoms of microthrombosis are interpreted as aspecies -specific exaggerated pharmacological effect. Studies evaluating the safet y of repeated administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) (daily over 14 days) were performed in a rodent (rat) and non -rodent (cynomolgus monkey ) species. Reversible signs of exaggerated pharmacological effects (regenerative anemia, thrombocy topenia, and treatment- related histopathologic changes in the heart, liver, and spleen) were observed in rats that were administered 1400 U VWF:RCo/kg /day + 1080 IU ADVATE/kg/day intravenousl y once daily for 14 day s. Also, these findings are interpreted as a species -specific exaggerated pharmacological effect due to the low susceptibility of human rVWF (vonicog alfa) to cleavage by rodent ADAMTS13 .13Notoxicologicall y relevant changes were evident for clinical observations, bod y weight, feed consumption, ophthalmology , urinal ysis, coagulation , and s erum chemistry parameters, platelet aggregation, and gross pathology. rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkey safter dail y intravenous ( i.v.)(bolus) administration of 100 U VWF:RCo/kg rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined with 77 IU/kg ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) over a period of 14 day s. No adverse effects could be detected in this species. For non-commercial use only"

Therefore, 100 UVWF:RCo/kg/day rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without 77 IU/kg ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was considered the n o observed adverse effect level (NOAE L)inthis study , which was the highest dose tested. Anti- drug antibodies, however, were formed in both species and resulted in a significant reduction in drug exposure after 14 applications as compared to a single application. These antibodies substantially reduced the sy stemic exposure to the test substance as compared to a single dose administration. No adverse effects due to antibody formation were observed in both species. rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was well tolerated locally and no genotoxic potential was evident after 2 in vitro and 1 in vivo genotoxicity study .A study on the influence of co- administration of VWF and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) onthe immunogenicity of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog al fa)in 3different hemophilic mouse models (E17 hemophilic Balb/c mice, E17 hemophilic C57BL/6J mice , and E17 hemophilic human F8 transgenic mice) showed that rVWF (vonicog alfa) does not negativel y impact the immunogenicit y of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa )in any of the three dif ferent hemophilic mouse models. 6.5.2 Findings from Clinical Studies The clinical safet y, efficacy and PK were assessed in 4 completed trials: one phase 1 study (070701)) and two phase 3 studies ( 071001 and071101) that enrolled patients with VWD; one phase 1 study ( 071104) that enrolled patients with hemophilia A. Details on study design, populations enrolled ,and safet y and efficacy outcomes of the phase 1 studies arepresented in Section 6.5.2.1 andSection 6.5.2.2, the phase 3 study in Section 6.5.2.3, and the phase 3 surgery study in Section 6.5.2.4 .Information on a single subject with VWD in Study 071401 is presented in Section 6.5.2.5. 6.5.2.1 Study 070701 Phase 1 clinical study 070701 was a multicenter, controlled, randomized, single -blind , prospective 3 -step, dose escalation study to investigate safet y, tolerability ,and PK of rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined at a fixed ratio with ADVATE (VWF:RCo/FVIII:C of 1.3 ± 0.2:1) in adults with severe VWD .14Subjects were enrolled in sequential cohorts in a dose escalatin g manner: Cohort 1, 2 ,and 3 received a single intravenous infusion of rVWF: ADVATE at the following doses: 2 IU/kg VWF:RCo (Cohort 1), 7.5 IU/kg VWF:RCo (Cohort 2), and 20 IU/kg VWF:RCo (Cohort 3).

The data generated in this p hase 1 study suggest that rVWF: ADVATE up to the highest investigated dose of 50 IU /kgVWF:RCo is well tolerated and safe in adults with severe VWD. No thrombo genic risk or thrombotic thrombocy topenic purpura (TTP)-like syndrome was observed, and no neutralizing antibodies to VWF or FVIII were identified. There were no deaths or other serious adverse reactions, and no infusions were interrupted or stopped due to a n AE. Overall, the reported AE profile was similar between the recombinant and plasma- derived concentrates. Secondar y endpoints were the PK assessment of VWF:RCo, von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag ) and multimeric composition of rVWF (vonicog alfa) as well as FVIII:C at standardized time points after single injections o f rVWF: ADVATE and pdVWF:FVIII. The median VWF:RCo terminal half-life (T 1/2)of rVWF (vonicog alfa) at the 50 IU/kg dose was 16 hours. T 1/2with pdVWF:FVIII at the same dose level appeared shorter at 12.58 hours, however, thelimits of the 90% CI were similar (11.73 to 17.7 hours vs. 11.87 to 18.03 hours). Themedian T1/2of VWF:RCo were shorter with the lower investigated doses: 7.13 hours an d 13.23 hours with the 7.5 IU/kg and 20 IU/kg doses, although these data were derived from a much sm aller number of subjects. In consequence of the missing ADAMTS13 cleavage ,ultra-large molecular weight (ULMW) multimers are contained in the rVWF (vonicog alfa) final product. The immediate cleavage of these ultra -large multimers by ADAMTS13 upon release into the circulation could be demonstrated appl ying sodium dodecy l sulfate pol yacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE )/Immunoblot with poly clonal an ti-VWF antibodies to detect the resulting rVWF (vonicog alfa) subunit cleavage fragments. Overall the data generated in this phase 1 study suggest that rVWF (vonicog alfa): ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) is well tolerated and safe in adults with severe VWD. For non-commercial use only"

All subjects underwent 3 PK anal yses: the first after infusion with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) alone, the second after infusion with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) plus 10 IU/kg rVWF (vonicog alfa) and the third after infusion with ADVATE (rFVIII, oct ocog alfa) plus 50 IU/kg rVWF (vonicog alfa) . The PK anal ysis was performed at intervals of approximately 8 to 14 day s. Before each infusion for PK assessment, there wasa wash -out period of at least 5 day s and the subjects were not actively bleeding. Primary outcome measures indicate that co -administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa) slightly sustain ADVATE activity with the highest observed ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) half-life of 13.74 h (CI 11.44 to16.52) after co -infusion of 50 IU/ kg ADVATE plus 50 IU/kg rVWF :RCo . Thehighest improvement in ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) circulating half -life was observed in subjects with VWF:Ag levels below 100% which indicates an association between baseline VWF:Ag levels and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) h alf-life increase. No treatment related A Es or SAEs were reported . No subject withdrew due to an AE and there were no deaths. No binding antibodies to VWF, CHO ,and rFurin were detectable in the confirmatory assay and no signs of a h ypersensi tivity to rVW F (vonicog alfa) or ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) antigen were observed. Laboratory values over time did not indicate an y potential safet y risk for hemophilia A patients treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa) and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in combination. In summary , the data indicate that rVWF (vonicog alfa) co-administered with ADVATE (rFV III, octocog alfa) up to the highest dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo is well tolerated and safe in hemophilia A patients.

The study consisted of 2parts (Part A and Part B). Part A consisted of PK assessments alone (Arm 2: PK50 onl y [without treatment of bleeding episodes]), or PK assessments (Arm 1: PK50 and Arm 3: PK80) plus on- demand treatment period(s) of 6 months for bleeding episodes, or on -demand treatment for bleeding episodes only (Arm 4). Except for subjects in arm 2 who completed study after second PK assessment, subjects receiving treatment for PK assessments and/or bleeding episodes in Part A were to be entered into Part B to continue on-demand treatment for bleeding episodes for 6additional months for a total of 12 months in the study . The primary outcome measure was the number of subjects with “treatment success” (extent of control of bleeding episodes), which was defined as a mean efficacy rating score of < 2.5 for a subject’s I P-treated bleeding episodes during the study . The rate of subjects with treatment success was 100% (Clopper -Pearson exact 90% CI: 84.7 to 100.0) for bleeds where the assessments were made prospectivel y and excluding GI bleeds. Sensitivity anal yses confirmed the r esults of the primary anal ysis. Crossover results at 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo showed that the PK profile for rVWF (vonicog alfa) VWF:RCo was independent of administration alone or with rFVIII (ADVATE , octocog alpha ) (T 1/2:19.4 hours for rVWF and 16.6 hours for rVWF:rFVIII; IR: 1.8 U/dL per IU/kg infused for both r VWF and rVWF:rFVIII; mean residence time ( MRT ): 26.7 hours for rVWF and 25.2 hours for rVWF:rFVIII). FVIII levels increased substantially with a median peak at 24 hours of 111.0 U/dL for rVWF:rFVIII and 86.0 U/dL after rVWF alone, indicating that rVWF (von icog alfa) induces a sustained increase in endogenous FVIII activity . The rVWF (vonicog alfa) PK profile was comparable at 50 IU/kg and 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo, and repeated PK at 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo showed close agreement between pretreatment and end -of-study resul ts.

Using 50 IU/kg for PK measurements, subjects in the 071001 study exhibiting a T 1/2for rVWF of 14, 16 ,or 19 hours had rVWF plasma concentrations at 72 hours after administration of 2.55, 4.01, and 6.49% above baseline, respectivel y, and plasma concentrations at 96 hours after administration of 0.78, 1.40 ,and 2.71% above baseline, respectively. In this context it should be noted that subjects in the present stud y who have significant spontaneou s bleeding while on twice weekly prophy laxis will have their regimen increase dto 3 times per week based on clear criteria for different bleeding locations ( for details s ee Section 8.6.4.3.1). Subjects in the present study who are switching from prophy laxis with a pdVWF product will begin on rVWF (vonicog alfa) using their same weekl y total dose in IU/kg VWF:RCo used during their pdVWF proph ylaxis div ided into twice weekly infusions (for details see section 8.6.4.3) . A total of 125 AEs occurred in 25/37 (67.7%) subjects (62/318 infusions [19.5%]) during or after infusion with I P. Of these, 116/125 were non -serious (all mild or moderate; none were severe ), and 9 SAEs were reported in 7 subjects. Of 125 total AEs, 38 were temporally associated with I P; 8 AEs were considered causally related to I P: 6 non- serious related AEs (tach ycardia, infusion site paraesthesia, electrocardiogram [ECG ] t-wave inversion, dysgeusia, generalized pruriti s, and hot flush) occurred in 4 subjects, and 2 related SAEs (chest discomfort and incr eased heart rate) occurred in 1subject. No deaths occurred during this study . None of the subjects developed anti- VWF or anti -FVIII neutr alizing antibodies and no binding antibodies to VWF or rFurin, or antibodies against CHO protein or anti -Murine IgG were observed. No clinical or subclinical signs or symptoms of a thrombogenic event were observed in this study . Following an initial increa se in ultralarge VWF multimers after administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa), a notable decrease in the proportion of large VWF multimers occurred between 12 and 24 hours post infusion, due to degradation by the endogenous ADAMTS13 followed by a continued de cline until the end of the 96 -hour follow -up period. Overall, the data support the safe and effective use of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without rFVIII (ADVATE, octocog alpha ) in the treatment of bleeds in patients with VWD.

Eleven subjects underwent a PK assessment by infusion of 50 ± 5 IU/kg rVWF:RCo at an infusion rate of up to 4 mL/min. 12 to 24 hours before surgery , subjects received a dose of 40 to 60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo. Within 3 hours prior to surgery , the subject’s FVIII:C levels were assessed with a target of 30 IU/dL for minor and oral surgeries and 60 IU/dL for major surgeries. Within 1 hour prior to surgery, subjects received a dose of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) (depending on the target FVIII:C levels at the 3 hour assessment). VWF and FVIII IR and T 1/2for each subject, when known, were used to guide the initial dose and subsequent doses. The primary outcome measure was the overall assessment of hemostatic efficacy assessed by the investigator (hemophilia phy sician) 24 hours after last perioperative IP infusion or at completion of day 14 visit, w hichever occurred earlier, and was summarized by the percentage of subjects in each efficacy category (“excellent”, “good”, “moderate” and “none”). Point estimate and corresponding 90% two -sided exact CI was calculated for the rate of subjects with an over all assessment of hemostatic efficacy . All 15 subjects treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa) (with or without ADVATE) for major (10), minor (4), and oral (1) elective surgical procedures had overall hemostatic efficacy ratings of “excellent” or “good”.

For subjects treated with rVWF alone, the median weight - adjusted dose (Q1, Q3) of rVWF was 35.4 IU/kg on postoperative Day 1 (n=2) and decreased to 23.7 IU/kg on postoperative Day 7 (n=4) and 25.5 IU/kg on postoperativ e Day 14(n=2). A total of 11 subjects were evaluated for PK in the study . As expected, postinfusion increases in concentrations of VWF:RCo, VWF:Ac, VWF:Ag, and VWF collagen binding ( VWF:CB ) were observed. Mean values for VWF:RCo were as follows: AUC0 -∞/dose was 37.50 hours*IU/dL per IU/kg infused; AUC0- 72h/dose was 34.08 hours*IU/dL per IU/kg infused; T1/2 was 17.83 hours; MRT was 24.32 hours; CLwas 0.03117 dL/hour/kg; and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss)was 0.6837 dL/kg. Median values for V WF:RCo were as follows: AUC0- ∞/dose was 32.94 hours*IU/dL per IU/kg infused; AUC0- 72h/dose was 31.70 hours*IU/ dL per IU/kg infused; T1/2 was 14.62 hours; MRT was 21.80 hours; CL was 0.03036 dL/hour/kg; and Vss was 0.7078 dL /kg. The VWF:RCo activity was consistent with that previously observed in clinical studies 071001 and 070701. rVWF (vonicog alfa) was safe and well tolerated in adults with severe VWD undergoing major, minor, and oral elective surgical procedures. Of the 12 total treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs )that occurred during the study , 2 deep vein thrombosis events (1 non - serious and 1 serious, as a part of one case) reported in one subject, who underwent total hip replacement surgery and who had concurrent condition of obesity , wasassessed by the sponsor as possibly causally -related to study treatment. None of the TEAEs were either a severe allergic or hy persensitivity reaction or developed due to a severe allergic reaction. One subject with VWD Ty pe 3 who had an intraoperative transfusion of pa cked red blood cells during total knee replacement surgery tested positive for binding antibodies to VWF on postoperative Day 7 through study completion.

For the initial rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusion, the subject received a test dose of 5% of thetotal dose of 60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo at an infusion r ate of 1 mL/min. After a 10 to 15-minute observation period, no adverse sy mptoms or signs were noted and the subject received the remaining 95% of the total dose. The subject was monitored for an y signs of an allergic reaction, and none were noted. Treatm ent with rVWF (vonicog alfa) every 12to 24 hours was tocontinue at the discretion of the investigator based on VWF levels and clinical s ymptomatology . The subject had an excellent response and recovery , which allowed for daily dosing of rVWF (vonicog al fa)and, within 24 hours, the subject’s bleeding had stopped. Daily dosing of rVWF (vonicog alfa) was maintained and the subject received his last dose on . The subject also received rVWF (vonicog alfa) for 7 days for prophy laxis for surger y (surgical resection of a left- kidney mass). The subject experienced no hemorrhagic complications and no AEs that were considered related to the use of rVWF (vonicog alfa). 6.6Evaluation of Anticipated Risks and Benefits of the Investigational Product(s) to Human Subjects Current treatment of VWD patients relies on desmopressin and VWF products manufactured from pooled human plasma. Human VWF produced b y recombinant technology could offer a new perspective in treatment of VWD. The benefit for the individual subject is anticipated to be significant during this clinical stud y. He/she may benefit from a product that minimizes excessive FVIII administration and thus allowing individualized dosing of VWF at optimal levels . Variations in VWF multimeric composition may lead to variability with respect to treating or preventing bleeds in VWD subjects, especially mucosal bleeds which are especiall y problematic. rVWF (vonicog alfa) product manufactured by Baxalta consistently contains ULMW VWF multimers due to the fact that the product has not been exposed to ADAMTS13.

By using a recombinant product, the risk of transmission of adventitious agents and other blood -borne pathogens associated with the use of products of human or animal origin has been eliminated. At this stage of product developmen t, the key societal benefit is a better understanding of advanced treatment options for VWD and enhanced product availability .

At the baseline visit the subjects will receive a dose of 50 ± 5 IU/kg rVWF:RCo for PK assessment . Blood samples will be drawn within 30minutes pre -infusion, and at 11 time points post -infusion ( 15 ± 5 minutes, 305minutes, 605minutes, 3 ± 0.5 hours, 6 0.5 hours , 12  0.5 hours , 240.5 hours , 30 ± 2 hours, 48 2 hours, 722 hours and 96 ± 2 hours ). A washout period of at least 5 day s is required prior to infusion of rVWF (vonicog alpha) for PK assessment .The 2ndPK assessment for on- demand subjects will be performed at steady state at the end of the study (see Section 11.6). Subject spreviously enrolled in rVWF studies 070701, 071001 or 071101 and having previously undergone PK assessments in these studies are required to repeat the PK assessment due to different dose and time points used in the seformer studies.

For pdVWF switch subjects, the rVWF (vonicog alfa) prophy laxis initiation treatment visit should occur within 42 days after the completion of screening procedures and confirmation of eligibility . At this visit subjects will receive their proph ylaxis initiation dose .The proph ylaxis do se s are described in Section 8.6.4.3 .

Examples of all dosing schedules are provided in Table 1. For pdVWF switch subjects, the weekl y dose (IU/kg) of IP for each patient will be equivalent (± 10%) to the weekly VWF dose received during proph ylactic treatment with pdVWF. The weekl y dose of IP should be divided into 2 infusions ( Table 1, Schedule A), with a maximum of 80 IU/kg/infusion. If needed ,based on the total weekly dose or other clinical judgements, the week ly dose may be given as three infusions (Table 1, Schedule B).

Dose and frequency adjustments should be agreed with the sponsor in advance unless it constitutes an urgent safet y measure . The rationa le for dosing adjustments need sto be documented in the subject’s medical record . For both OD and switch patients, dose escalations (not exceeding the upper dose limit of 80 IU/kg rVWF:RCo) and increase of dose frequency will only be allowed in case of insufficient therapeutic response with breakthrough bleeding episodes. The c riteria for dose and /orfrequency escalation are specific to each bleeding indication but, overall, involve 1 significant breakthrough bleeding epis ode despite the subject being compliant with scheduled proph ylaxistreatment . For switch patients who require a dose escalation due to a breakthrough bleed, the frequency should be kept the same but the dose (IUVWF:RCo per infusion) should be increased u p to 80 I U VWF:RCo. Following that, increases in frequency may be considered upon consultation with the Sponsor. For on demand subjects who require a dose escalation, at the discretion of the PI upon consultation with the Sponsor, the frequency may be kept the same but the dose (IUVWF:RCo per infusion) should be increased up to 80 I U VWF:RCo. I f this proves to be insufficient, then the dosing frequ ency may be increased in these subjects. Table 2 presents the criteria for dosing escalation per each bleeding indication taken 50 ± 10 I U VWF:RCo/kg twice weekly dose as an example of subject’s assigned starting dose. The criteria are applicable for both OD and switch subjects who were initially assigned to twice weekly dosing .Subjects entering the study will begin proph ylaxis treatment according to Schedule A ( Table 1)and will remain at this dose and frequency until meeting the criteria for escalation to the next higher schedule : for example, from 2 infusions of 50 ± 10 IUVWF:RCo/kg/week to 3 infusions of 50 ± 10 IU VWF:RCo/kg/week (Schedule B) to achieve an adequate therapeutic response .If a subject started with a weekly dose (possible for switch subjects), similar criteria would apply except that the subject will be excalated to twice weekl y dosing if frequency change is necessary .

If a subject experiences a bleed while receiving rVWF (vonicog alfa) three times per week, the investigator should treat the bleed with rVWF (vonicog alfa) at doses up to 80IU VWF:RCo/kg at a frequency determined by the investigator until the bleed resolves. Upon resolution of the bleeding event, the subject will return to their assigned prophy laxis regimen. Itis essential for the success of this study that the subjects adhere to treatment regimens . Therefore, procedures for monitoring subject’s compliance are implemented (see Section 10.7) . If 1infusion of IP is missed, the subject may administer the I P as soon as possible .The subject should adhere to the irtreatment scheme ensuring a minimum interval of 12 hours between this and the previous I P infusion. For example ,a subject routinel y infuses I P on Monday and Thursday ,he/she misses the Monday time point and therefore may infuse the IP on the next day (Tuesday )and thereafter proceed with infusing the IP on Thursday (considering a minimum 12 hours between the infusions )and return to the initial schedule. If more than 30% of infusions of IP are misse dwithin the visit interval of 3 months the subject will be discontinued from the stud y (see Section 9.4). 8.6.4.3.2 General Instructions for Home Treatment forProphylaxis At the discretion of the investigator, a subject may be considered suitable for home treatment only after the subject has received at least 1infusion of I Pin the clinic ,either during planned proph ylactic IP exposure or during the treatment of bleeding episodes, and meets the following additional criteria : 1.Fully understands the concept of a clinical study and related documentation (documented training of at least 30 minutes), 2.Has a history of previous experience with home treatment including self-administration and treatment with VWF containing concentrates, 3.Has adequate time for initial training of the stud y drug preparation (preparation, mixing and infusion of the IP(s) (documented tr aining of at least 30 minutes) .

In the event a healthcare professional is required to administer IP, he/she must be trained and qualified by the investigator on the above procedures prior to the decision for home treatment. A Subject Guideline detailing all instructions and information listed above will be provided to each subject. 8.6.4.4 Treatment of Bleeding Episodes 8.6.4.4.1 General Instructions for Home Treatment of Bleeding Episodes If a subject experiences a bleeding episode, he/she should contact the study site immedia tely and the site investigator should provide instructions on the treatment regimen. If the subject initiates the treatment at home, he/she should at least follow up with the study site if avisit is needed as per the standard of care at the center . In the event a healthcare professional is required to administer treatment at the subject’s home, he/she must be trained and qualified b y the site investigator on the above procedures prior to the decision for home treatment. Once a subject has received 1infusion of rVWF (vonicog alfa) in the clinic (either during planned IP exposure or during the t reatment o f a bleeding episode) and meets the criteria for home treatment, the treatment of bleeding episodes with I P can be conducted at home (see Section 8.6.4.3.2). If a subject is not qualified for home treatment, rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusions must be administered at the study site. If a subject experiences a bleeding episode that requires treatment between the screening and the proph ylaxis initiation visit , the subject will be treated with I P (rVWF with or without ADVATE ). Treatment with I P must occur at the study site unless the subject has previously qualified for home treatment with rVWF (vonicog alfa) . If rVWF (vonicog alfa) treatment is not feasible, the subject may use his/her standard of care, such as commercial pdVWF/FVIII products. In any case a washout period of at least 5 day s is requir ed prior to rVWF (vonicog alfa) PK infusion at the initial PK assessment visit for on-demand subjects . If a subject experiences a bleeding episode requiring treatment during the PK assessment, rVWF (vonicog alfa) should be used to treat the bleed . Blood draws for PK assessment will be stopped and the PK assessments will be repeated once the bleed has resolved and the subject is free of any symptoms related with the bleeding episode . Dose and frequency of rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusions or any other replacement therapy to stop the bleed should be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ), and the reason for the use of any non -IP product or therapy should be documented .

It is the sponsor’s opinion that, in many cases, treatment with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) may not be necessary, since rVWF (vonicog alfa) proph ylaxis will serve to increase endogenous FVIII levels. However, if endogenous FVIII is below 30-40 % or is unknown and cannot be estimated from the subject’s PK study , an infusion of rVWF: ADVATE at anrVWF: ADVATE ratio of 1.3:1± 0.2 should be administered initially . Subsequent infusion sshould be with rVWF:RCo 40 to 60 I U/kg with or , in many cases, without 30 to 45 I U/kg ADVATE (only to be administered if plasma FVIII levels fall below 30 IU/L during the treatment period) . Dosing may be adju sted downward or upward up to 80 IU/kg rVWF at the treating ph ysician’s discretion based upon the subject’s prior history , PK and other factors. If FVIII levels are not available, dosing is at the discretion of the investigator based upon the individual su bject’s PK data. Using ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in addition to rVWF (vonicog alfa) in subsequent doses carries the risk of an excessive rise in FVIII:C. Therefore, reduced doses of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) and/or prolongation of the dose interval should be considered. The following is general guidance and the sponsor’s suggestion for treatment of breakthrough bleeds, however each PI will determine the treatment based on the local acceptable practice how to monitor and adjust treatment for a bleed ing episode. An effort should be made to discuss with the sponsor (or sponsor’s delegate) the treatment strategy . In general the aim of the initial dose should be full replacement of VWF with VWF:RCo levels of >0 .6IU/ml (60%) and FVIII:C of > 0.4 IU/mL (40%). In major bleeding episodes ,subsequent doses should keep the trough level of VWF:RCo >50% for 3 day s and then as deemed necessary by the investigator for subsequent days. In moderate bleeding episodes ,the dose and trough level may be reduced to >30% f or as long as deemed necessary by the investigator. Treatment for minor bleeding episodes will generall y consist of onl y 1 or 2 doses of rVWF (vonicog alfa) IP. If the VWF:RCo level is above 150%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 12 hours ; if the VWF:RCo level is above 200%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 24 hours. In either case, a lower subsequent dose (e.g., 20 IU/kg VWF:RCo) may be appropriate. Dosing recommendations are listed in Table 3. For non-commercial use only"

A diagnosis of menorrhagia will be defined by a prospectively completed Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) score > 185 and normal cervical cytology or requiring use of a VWF -containing concentrate for treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding for at least one menstrual cycle during the prior year. Variances of up to 10% in dosing are permissible during treatment of bleeding episodes, but rounding to the nearest vial size should be avoided. Subjects with non- neutralizing binding anti -VWF antibodies should initially be treated with a dose known to be efficacious based on the subject’s medical treatment history which may differ from the recommendations provided in Table 3. Subjects should be monitored for lack of efficacy as well as for FVIII (mandatory ), VWF:RCo (m andatory ), and VWF:Ag (optional where testing is not available) levels aft er 3 to 6hours. Re -dosing with rVWF (vonicog alfa) in combination with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) using the same (initial) dose and adaptation of the dosing frequency should be considered until cessation of the bleed, if the FVIII and/or VWF:RCo levels drop below 30% -50% depending on bleeding severity .

Subjects who at time of screening have a n alread y scheduled surgical intervention are not eligible for participation in the study . 8.6.4.5.1 Major, Minor and Oral Surgery Definition The following definitions and criteria are used to serve as a guidance for major, minor and oral surgery . Major surgeries generally refer to major orthopedic surgery (e.g., joint replacement, arthroscopic or open s ynovectomy , arthrodesis, hardware removals like plates or intramedullary nails, etc.), major abdominal surgery (e.g. open or laparoscopic hernioplasty , cholecy stectomy , colon or small bowel resection, etc.), major gy necological surgery (e.g. open or laparoscopic m yomectom y, hysterectomy, removal of endometriosis, poly ps, cysts, adhesioly sis, etc.), major head and neck surgery (e.g.: tonsillectomy , adenoidectomy , rhinoplast y, lymphadenectomy, th yroidectomy , parotidectom y. etc.), an y intracranial , cardiovascular or spinal surgery and any other surgery which has a significant risk of large volume blood loss or blood loss into a confined anatomical space. Extraction of impacted third molars is generall y also considered major surgery due to the expected difficulty of surgery and the expected blood loss. Minor surgeries generally refer to interventions such as placement of intravenous access devices, removal of small skin lesions, arthroscopy, gastroscop y, colonoscopy or conisation. Oral surgeries comprise extractions of fewer than three teeth, if the teeth are non -molars and have no bon y involvement.

As a general guidance a priming dos e of 40 -60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo will be administered .If not assessed prior to the preoperative priming dose, a IR recovery may be calculated for subjects undergoing minor and oral surgery . 8.6.4.5.3 Preoperative Loading Dose An rVWF (vonicog alfa) loading dose should be administed within 3 hours before surgery . VWF and FVIII levels should be assessed within 3 hours prior to surgery initiation and results must be available prior to administering the loading dose. If FVIII levels prior to loading dose administration are not at least 30 IU/dL (minor, oral surgery ), or 60 IU/dL (major surgery ) ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) will be administered in addition to rVWF (vonicog alfa) in order to raise FVIII:C levels to recommended levels. The preoperative loading dose will be calcul ated as the difference in the target peak and baseline plasma VWF:RCo levels divided by the IR (ΔVWF:RCo x BW (kg) /IR) . The PK results will be provided prior to the planned surgery . If the IR is not available, assume an IR of 1.7 IU/dL per IU/kg and calculate the initial dose as follows: (100 –baseline plasma VWF:RCo) x BW (kg) / 1.7. For minor and oral surgery , the IR from the Preoperative Priming Dose visit will be used to guide dosing and the target peak is 50-60 IU/dL VWF :RCo and 40 -50 IU/dL FVIII. For major surgery , the target peak is 100IU/dL VWF:RCo and 80 -100 IU/dL FVIII. The surgery may only start after normalization of the activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT). 8.6.4.5.4 Intra- and Postoperative (maintenance) Dosing After the preoperative loading dose(s), subjects who have not achieved the desired postinfusion recovery will continue to receive rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) as a bolus infusion, depending on VWF and FVIII levels. The peri -and post -operative substitution regimen will be individualized according to the PK results, intensity and duration of the hemostatic challenge, and the institution’s standard of care.

Subjects undergoing oral surgery will be infused with rVWF (vonicog alfa) at least once within the f irst 8- 12 hours, targeting >30 IU/dL ( rVWF and FVIII). Subjects undergoing major surgery will be infused with rVWF (vonicog alfa) every 12-24 hours for at least the first 72 hours post -surgery , targeting a VWF:RCo and FVIII:C trough plasma leve l >50 IU/dL, followed by further treatment post - 72 hours for as long as deemed necessary by the Investigator, targeting a VWF:RCo and FVIII:C trough plasma level of >30 IU/dL . Dose modifications based on pre -infusion VWF/FVIII levels will be performed as needed. For subsequent infusions post surgery , in case pre -infusion levels are not available prior to the consecutive infusion in a timely manner, pre -infusion levels from the previous dose may be used by the investigator for dosing guidance. Peak plasma level guidance is matching to Section 8.6.4.4.2 A schedule of all perioperative visit assessments and laboratory sampling can be found in supplement t ables in Section 20.2.1 and Section 20.3.1. 8.6.4.6 Thrombosis Prophylaxis Thromboembolic events have been reported in patients who have VWD, especiall y in the setting of known risk factors for thrombosis including low ADAMTS13 levels . Therefore, subjects who are at risk for developing thromboembolic events should be monitored fo r earl y signs of thrombosis, and prophylaxis measures against thromboembolism should be instituted according to current recommendations and standard of care . For all subjects who are VWD patients and are receiving VWF concentrate, attention should be given to avoid exceeding maximal recommended plasma activity levels of VWF:RCo (250 IU/dL) and FVIII (250 IU/dL). Anticoagulation measures, such as heparin, are acceptable and should follow study site standards. The investigator will record the use and reasons for such measures/agents on the appropriate CRF.

For example, the third subject who signed an informed cons ent form at stud y site 02 will be identified as Subject 071301 -020003. All study documents (e .g., CRFs, clinical documentation, sample containers, drug accountability logs, etc.) will be identified with the SI C. Additionally , a uniquely coded SI C(s) is per mitted as long as it does not contain a combination of information that allows identification of a subject (e .g., collection of a subject’s initials and birth date would not be permitted), in compliance with laws governing data privacy . 10.3 Screening and Study Visits The study site is responsible for maintaining a screening log that includes all subjects who provided informed consent . The log also will serve to document the reason for screening failure. All screening data will be collected and reported in CRF, regardless of screening outcome. If a subje ct is re -screened, the End of Study CRF should be completed, and a new ICF, new SIC and new CRF are required for that subject. The overall study design is illustrated in the Figure 1. Details on the procedures to be performed at each stud y visit, including screening, are provided in Supplement 20.2 „Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments “and Supplement 20.3 „Clinical Laboratory Assessments “. 10.3.1 Scre ening V isit Written informed consent must be obtained from each subject before an y study related procedures are performed. To initiate screening procedures, at least 72 hours must have elapsed since the last VWF administration for on -demand subjects and the subject must not be actively bleeding at the time of screening. For switch subjects, the usual interval between their pdVWF proph y infusions must have elapsed since the last VWF administration and the subject must not be actively bleeding at the t ime of screening. Multimer analysis and VWD gene mutation analy sis should be performed atscreening if not available in the subject’s medical history . For non-commercial use only"

I f the IP is not infused within 42 day s,allscreening assessments except blood group, human leu kocy te antigen ( HLA), genetics , multimeric pattern and ,must be repeated to reconfirm eligibility . Refer to Supplement 20.2 and Supplement 20.3. Upon completion of screening procedures, subject eligibility will be confirmed by the sponsor on a subject eligibility form before additional study procedures are undertaken. The subject will maintain a diary that will include infusion logs (see Section 10.5). The allocation of IP will be initiated after the subject has qualified for home treatment (see Section 8.6.4.3.2 ). In the event ofa subject experienc inga bleeding episode that requires treatment between the screening visit and the subsequent visit (i.e. initial PK assessment visit for on -demand subjects or proph ylaxis initiation visit for switch subjects ), the subject willbe treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa) . If rVWF (vonicog alfa) is not available for any reason , e.g., subject not yet trained on IP administration, study site visit for IP administration not feasible, etc., the subject may use h is/her standard of care, such as commercial pdVWF/FVIII products , and the reason for the use of non -IP products should be clearl y documented. 10.3.2 Baseline Vi sit – Initial PKAssessment (On-demand Subject sOnly) After screening and confirmation of eligibility on-demand subjects will undergo a n initial PK assessmen t. Subjects will receive a dose of 50 ± 5 IU/kg rVWF:RCo to determine VWF and FVIII levels. Blood samples will be drawn within 30 minutes pre-infusion, and at 11 time points post -infusion ( 15 ± 5 minutes, 30 5 minutes, 60 5 minutes, 3 ± 0.5 hours, 6 0.5hours, 12  0.5hours, 24 0.5hours, 30 ± 2 hours, 48 2 hours, 722hours and 96 ± 2 hours). See Section 20.2 and Section 20.3. IP infusion vials from the same lot number should be used for all PK-assessments per subject . Samples for measurement of FVIII and VWF activity taken through to 6hours post -infusion will be obtained from an extremity different from th at used for the infusion of IP. Where needed, the phlebotomy site will be kept patent via an infusion of normal saline. In this event, at least 5 mL of blood will be collected and discarded before collection of the next test sample into a fresh s yringe. If the subject has a central venous catheter, the central line should be used to administer the infusion and a peripheral venipuncture should be used to collect the blood samples.

An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign ( e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom (e. g., rash, pain, discomfort, fever, dizziness, et c.), disease (e.g., peritonitis, bacteremia, etc.),or outcome of death temporally associated with the use of an IP, whether or not considered causall y related to the I P. 12.1.1.1 Serious Adverse Event A nSAE is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that ,at any dose , meets one or more of the following criteria: Outcome is fatal/results in death (including fetal death) Is life -threatening – defined as an event in which the subject was, in the judgment of the investigator, at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that h ypotheticall y might have caused death had it been more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization –inpatient hospitalization refers to any inpatient admis sion, regardless of length of stay . Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (i.e.,a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) Is acongenital anomal y/birth defect Is a medicall y important event –a medical event t hat may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or require hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definitions above. Exa mples of such events are (including but not limited to) : Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood d yscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependence or drug abuse Reviewed and confirmed seroconversion for HIV, hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), or parvovirus B19 (B19V) For non-commercial use only"

However, when there is an increase in the severit y, duration, or frequency of a preexisting disease, the event must be described as “worsening” of the pre-existing cond ition on the AE CRF. 12.1.2 Assessment of Adverse Events For the purposes of this study , the following will not be considered as AEs and will not be included in the analy sis of AEs. Bleeding episodes are part of the underl ying disease and therefore are not AEs; they will be evaluated in the context of efficacy . For non -serious bleeding episode scaused b y an injury, the injury would not be reported as an AE, unless it resulted in a medical finding other than a bleeding episode (e.g., abrasion of ski n). Therefore, a ny VWD -related bleeding event (e.g., epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, musculo -skeletal bleeding, menorrhagia) that is non -serious will not be reported as an AE. However, the investigator may decide that the event is an AE if the event also would have occurred in a healthy individual under the same circumstances.  For serious bleeding episodes (bleeding SAEs ): Bleeding events that meet seriousness criteria (death, life -threatening, hospitalizing/prolongation of hospitalization, disability , congenital anomal y, or medically significant andif not urgentl y treated would result in one of the above) should be captured on the SAE eCRF andreported as an SAE to the Sponsor or designee (e.g., CRO) on an SAE Report form as described in Section 12.1.2.3 (Safet y Reporting) . Seroconversion after documented HAV/HBV vaccination prior to or during the study period.

Each AE will be evaluated b y the investigator for: Seriousness as defined in Section 12.1.1.1 Severity as defined in Section 12.1.2.1 Causal relationship to I P exposure or study procedure as defined in Section 12.1.2.2 For each AE, the outcome (i .e., recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved, recovered/resolved with sequelae, not recovered/not resolved, fatal , unknown ) and if applicable , action taken with regards to the stud y treatment (i .e., dose increased, dose not changed, dose reduced, drug interrupted, drug withdrawn , not applicable, or unknown ) will also be recorded on the AE CRF. Recovering/resolving AEs will be followed until resolution or until the subject’s condition returns to the level at the baseline for pre - existing conditions . If the severity rating for an ongoing AE changes before the event resolves, the original AE report will be revised (i.e., the event will not be reported as separate AE). During the course of an y AE, the highest severit y rating will be reported. Deviations from the protocol -specified dosage (including underdosing /overdosi ng [<20 IU/kg rVWF:RCo or > 100rVWF:RCo], abuse, and withdrawal, treatment errors (including incorrect route of administration, use of an incorrect product, and deviations from the protocol -defined dosing schedule), failures of expected pharmacological actions, and unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefits will be f ollowed with regard tooccurrence of AEs, lack of efficacy , and/or other observations because these events may be reportable to regulatory authorities. Any pregnancy that occurs after administration of IP will be reported on a Pregnancy Form and followed- up at 1 y ear post- delivery , if feasible.

These severity definitions will also be used to assess the se verity of an AE with a study- related procedure(s), if necessary . 12.1.2.2 Causality Causality is a determination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the I P is etiologicall y related to/associated with the AE. Causality assessment includes, e .g., assessment of temporal relationships, dechallenge/rechallenge information, association (or lack of association) with underly ing disease, presence (or absence) of a more likely cause, and ph ysiological plausibility . For each AE, the investigator will assess the causal relationship between the IP and the AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment according to the following most appropriate algorithm for the circumstances of the AE: Not related (both circumstances must be met) Is due to underl ying or con current illness, complications, concurrent treatments, or effects of concurrent drugs For non-commercial use only"

Hematology and clinical chemistry assessments will be performed on Ethy lenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA )-anticoagulated whole blood and serum, respectivel y, at the central laboratory . 12.9.3 Immunology 12.9.3.1 Antibodies to VWF and FVIII All subjects will be tested for binding and neutralizing antibodies to VWF and FVIII at screeni ng, at initial PK assessment, at each of the scheduled follow -up visits and at the study completion visit. Testing will be done prior to IP infusion and with at least a 72hour wash out period since the last I P infusion. If there is any suspicion of inhibitor development (e.g. excessive bleeding) binding and neutralizing antibodies to VWF and FVIII may be tested at the discretion of the investigator. 12.9.3.2 Neutralizing and Total Binding Anti -VWF Antibodies The assay s to establish the presence of neutralizing and total binding anti -VWF antibodies have been established in the absence of international standards and with only limited numbers of positive controls. Therefore, caution is advised in interpreting positive results. I n particular, any clinical association, changes in the natural history of the disease, effect of therapy, etc. needs to be taken into account for final judgment. Thesponsor’s Medical Director should be consulted for additional advice. As part of the AE follow -up, an y sample testing positive needs to be confirmed after 2 -4 weeks for central lab oratory testing. Only confirmed neutralizing anti -VWF antibodies are considered inhibitors (see Section 12.9.3.4) . These subjects need to be closely monitored and therap y adjusted accordingl y. 12.9.3.3 Binding antibodies to VWF The presence of total binding anti-VWF antibodies will be determined by an enzy me- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) employ ing poly clonal anti -human Immunoglobulin (Ig)antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA). For this assay (ELI SA), recombinant human VWF will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then incubated with dilutions of the positive control, the negative control or test sample. Antibodies against human VWF that are present in the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -coupled goat anti-human antibody (secondary antibody ). The positive control for this assay will be a human monoclonal antibody specific for human VWF spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human plasma.

First, the sample is screened for antibodies and the titer of binding antibodies is determined. Second, the specificit y of positive antibody results is confirmed.16 Inbrief, all samples are serially diluted (initial dilution 1:20 and further diluted 1:2). Thetiter endpoint, defined as the highest dilution that still gives a positive signal above cut off level, is determined in two independent duplicates. The cut off level is established based on background signal level of healthy plasma donors (n=160) and set to include 5% false positives to be as sensitive as possible (95% percentile). The ELISA assay is validated allowing a nassay variability of ± 1 titer step. Therefore, differences ≤ 2 titers steps may be due to variability of the ELISA assay. Speci ficity has to be confirmed in a competition assay when a sample has a titer of 1:80 or higher in the screening assay . Based on the validation criteria samples tested in the screening assay at 1:20 or 1:40 cannot be confirmed in the competition assay . A positive screening value is confirmed if the difference between the titers determined for the subject sample (re -screen) and for the subject sample with pre -incubation (confirmation sample) is > 2 titer steps. Antibody titers of subject samples will only be reported as positive, if the results of the screening and confirmatory anal ysis fulfill these acceptance criteria. The titer to be reported is alway s the one determined in the original screening procedure (independent of the result of the re -screening in the confirmation procedure). A more detailed test procedure will be supplied upon request or pro -actively if a sample tests positive. A treatment related increase of the binding anti -VWF antibodies is expected, if the titer increases b y more than 2 titration steps. These subjects need to be closely monitored and therapy adjusted accordingly . 12.9.3.4 Neutralizi ng A ntibodies to VWF Three functional VWF assay s, VWF:CB, VWF:RCo and VWF:FVIIIB assay s, will be used to test for the presence of neutralizing anti-VWF antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies to VWF:RCo, VWF:CB and VWF:FVIIIB activities will be measured b y assay s based on the Bethesda assay established for quantitative analy sis of FVIII inhibitors (Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay ) .17The amount of inhibitor is expressed as BU per mL. One BU is thereb y defined as the amount o f inhibitor that decreases the measured activity in the assay s to 50% of that of the negative control samples. The assay s were validated using human plasma samples from two type 3 VWD patients with low (1-2 BU/mL) and high (~10 BU/mL) titer inhibitors and plasma samples from non-human primates immunized with human rVWF (vonicog alfa) (>100 BU/mL) .

How ever, if baseline levels are too high (>15% VWF:RCo), inhibitors may not be reliabl y detected. To exclude false positive results, the detection limit for anti-VWF inhibitors was set to 1BU/ml for all 3 assay s. The rationale for this cut -off value is the r elativel y high CIof the underl ying assay s, making determinations at the end of the evaluation range of the Bethesda reference curve uncertain.18A more detailed test procedure may be requested to further characterize the anti- VWF inhibitors, if detected. Only confirmed positive anti-VWF inhibitor test r esult will be reported and will be considered as a medically significant SAE. 12.9.3.5 Binding Antibodies to FVIII Binding antibodies against FVIII will be anal yzed using a proprietary enzyme immunoassay . The testing strategy will be as described for binding anti -VWF antibodies. Antibody -containing samples will be identified in a screening assay followed by a confirmatory assay to exclude false positive results. 12.9.3.6 Neutralizing Antibodies (I nhibitors) to FVIII Neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to FVIII will be assessed b y the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay in a central laboratory . To verify a FVIII inhibitor, additional testing (such as tests for L upus anticoagulants) may be initiated. Positive FVIII inhibitor tests will be defined as ≥ 0.4 BU b y the Nijmegen -modified Bethesda assay that is confirmed b y a second test performed on an independent sample obtained 2- 4 weeks following the first test.

In vitro and in vivo cleavage of these ultrala rge molecular fractions by ADAMTS13 and generation of characteristic satellite bands has been extensively demonstrated during nonclinical and clinical development. Nevertheless, the potential elevated risk of thrombosis and/or other thromboembolic complications due to the administration of ultra large molecular VWF multimers in subjects with normal levels of VWF cannot be completely excluded. Therefore VWF multimer anal ysis will not only be performed routinel y at screening but in case of thromboembolic even ts,both VWF multimer anal ysis as well as ADAMTS13 activity will be determined to assess an y relatedness of these occurrences with I P treatment. 12.9.10.1 VWF Multimer Analysis The VWF multimer pattern will be assessed using low -resolution sodium dodecy l sulfate (SDS) –agarose gel electrophoresis. High -resolution SDS –agarose gel electrophoresis, with agarose concentrations 1.5%, will be used to determine the satellite band structure of VWF. These anal yses will employ Western blot with luminescence video imaging. 12.9.10.2 ADAMTS13 Activity VWF73 was identified as the 73 amino acid minimal region of the VWF A2 domain required for ADAMTS13 cleavage. The cleavage of this substrate will be detected b y a commerciall y available ELISA -based Chromogenic assay (Technoclone Austria): Cleavage of immobilized VWF73 substrate is detected b y a HRP -labeled antibody directed against the cleavage site of VWF73.

While a negative result practically rules out thrombosis, a positive result can indicate thrombosis but does not rule out other potential etiologies, including a recent hemorr hage. Its main use, therefore, is to exclude thromboembolic disease where the probability is low. D -Dimer will be measured at the Screening visit and used as indicator for an increased thrombotic risk. 12.9.13 Additional Laboratory Testing in C ase of Severe Hypers ensitivity Reactions If a subject develops a severe hypersensitivity reaction in the course of the clinical study ,additional blood will be drawn for anti-VWF IgE antibod y testing. The presence of anti-VWF IgE will be determined by using the ImmunoCAP®, a VWF -specific IgE blood test (Thermo Scientific). The basis of the ImmunoCAP® technology isa cellulose polymer as solid phase in a plastic capsule providing a large surface for protein binding. rVWF (vonicog alfa) as antigen is covalently coupled to the c ellulose polymer. Detection of specific anti -VWF IgE bound to the antigen will be accomplished by a secondary enzy me-labeled anti -human IgE antibody . Testing for binding anti -human VWF IgE antibodies will be done with 0.5 mL plasma.

BACKGROUND INFORMATIO N 6.1Description of Investigational Product Baxalta US Inc. (here after referred to as Baxalta or sponsor) has developed a human recombinant von Willebrand Factor (rVWF , vonicog al fa), which is co -expressed with recombinant factor VIII (r FVIII)in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line and separ ated during the subsequent downstream process. To address concerns regarding the risk of transmission of blood- bornepathogens that may be introduced by human plasma, no exogenousl y added raw materia ls of human or animal origin are employed in the cell culture, purification, or formulation of the final container product. The only proteins present in the final container product other than rVWF (vonicog alfa) are trace quantities of murine immunoglobuli n (IgG, from the immunoaffinity purification), host cell (i .e., CHO) protein, rFurin (used to further process rVW F). rVWF (vonicog alfa) is intended for the treatment of von Willebrand disease (VWD). rVWF (vonicog alfa) has been developed under the Baxalta internal code BAX111 and is used as investigational product (I P) in this study . rVWF (vonicog alfa) may be used with or without ADVATE (rFVIII , octocog alfa ) for the treatment of bleeding episodes (see Section 8.6.4.4). See Section 8.6for further information on the I Ps and their usage in this study . A detailed description of rVWF (vonicog alfa) is also provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). rVWF (vonicog alfa) was granted licensure in the United States in Dec ember 2015 under the brand name VONVENDI for the on- demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes in adults diagnosed with VWD ; as of the date of this protocol VONVENDI is not y et available on the market. 6.2Clinical Condition /Indication Von Willebrand Factor (VWF )is a large multimeric gl ycoprotein with a molecular weight that varies from 500 to 20,000 kDa. VWF is normally found in plasma and produced in the alpha -granules of platelets and in endothelial cell organelles known as the Weibel -Palade bodies. VWF mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular injury , one of the key functions in primary hemostasis. VWF also serves to stabilize coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), where FVIII is an essential cofactor of secondary hemostasis, which leads t o fibrin clot formation.2Qualitative and/or quantitative deficiencies of VWF lead to a highl y variable bleeding diathesis known as VWD, the most common of the hereditary coagulation factor deficiencies. Penetrance ofVWD is highly variable, with only a small fraction of mildly affected patients display ing clinical s ymptoms or a family history of a bleeding diathesis. For non-commercial use only"
606,page_606,"rVWF Page 25of 143 Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: 071301 2018 MAY 18 BAX ALTA CONFIDENTIAL –RESTRICTED: DO NOT D ISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PRIOR APPROVALThe current biochemical - based classification distinguishes disorders arising from partial quantitative (ty pe 1), qualitative (ty pe 2), or virtually complete (t ype 3) deficiencies of VWF. Up to 70% of VWD patients are diagnosed with ty pe 1 VWD, which may also be associated with minor functional defects in the molecule. In general, patients with ty pe 1 VWD display mild clinical sy mptoms. Approximately 20 to 30% of V WD patients are diagnosed with ty pe 2 VWD. Ty pe 2 VWD is further divided into 4 subty pes (A, B, N, and M), reflecting distinct classes of functional abnormalities. These defects result in abnormal functional and/or multimeric distribution patterns that fac ilitate their diagnosis. The bleeding diathesis is usually moderate and primarily affects the mucosal tissues. Type 2N VWD patients are sometimes misdiagnosed as mild hemophilia A. Finally , approximately 1% percent of VWD patients exhibit a total or near t otal absence of VWF, which is classified as t ype 3 VWD. The incidence of ty pe 3 VWD is estimated at 0.5-1.0 x 106. This ty pe is also associated with a ve ry low FVIII level (t ypically <5%) because the VWF carrier function for FVIII is lost. Replacement of VWF alone stabilizes endogenous FVIII, resulting in hemostatic levels withi n several hours post -infusion. Published results from studies of a plasma -derived VWF (pdVWF) concentrate demonstrated an increase of FVIII at an approximate rate of 5.8 1 IU dL-1h-1.3Type 3 VWD patients display severe hemorrhagic s ymptoms with bleeding predominantly in mucosal tissues, muscle and joints. All VWD patients, particularl y those with ty pe 2 or type 3 VWD, are at an increased risk for life- threatening bleeding episodes. 6.3The Role of Prophylaxis in the M anagement of VWD The goals of long term prophy laxis in VWD are to maintain VWF and FVIII at sufficient levels to reduce the frequency and duration of bleeding episodes, the need for red blood cell transfusions, and the risk of complications, such as arthropath y.4In contrast to hemophilia ,routine prophy laxis is not as estab lished in VWD , although prophy laxis for patients with severe VWD was in use in Sweden alread y during the 1950s .5In those earl y days of VWD treatment, plasma FVIII concentrates containing VWF fractions were applied for replacement therap y ,which then were followed by plasma derived VWF products containing fractions of FVIII (pdVWF/FVIII). A Swedish cohort including 37 patients with t ype 3 VWD under proph ylactic median treatment of 11 years (range 2 to 45 years) was retrospectivel y anal yzed.6,7The doses used for proph ylaxis,given once weekly for at least 45 weeks per y ear, were calculated based on 12 to 50 IU/ kgbody weight (BW)of FVIII clotting activity (FVIII:C ) which approxim ately corresponded to 24 -100 IU/kg von Willebrand factor: Ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:R Co)considering that mainly Haemate with a known VWF:RCo/FVIII:C ratio of about 2 was used. An escalation of doses from 1to 3dose levels was allowed depending on the frequency and severit y of bleeding episodes . For non-commercial use only"

Whereas the median value for bleeds per year was about 10 be fore prophy laxis this value could be reduced to less than 1 bleed per year during prophy laxis. The benefit of proph ylaxis for such indications was retrospectivel y also demonstrated in a cohort of Italian patients including t ype 3, 2A, 2M and type 1 patient s. Prophy laxis was started after sever egastrointestinal or joint bleeding episodes and completely prevented bleeding episodes in 8 of these 11 patients and largely reduced the need of blood transfusions in the remaining 3. A regimen of 40 IU rVWF:RCo/kg was applied every other day or twice a week. A prospective study on prophy laxis, the PRO.WILL study , has been initiated in I taly.8 The results of a prospective study investigating the prophy laxis inchildren and young adults showed a significantly reduced bleeding frequency and bleeding score ( 3vs. 0.07; 3 vs. 0. p<0.001) compared to the pre- prophy laxis values. The median dose was 40(20-47) IU /kgVWF:RCo administered mainly twice weekly in 23 patients , 3 times a week in 7 patients and 4times a week in 2 children .9 The VWD Prophy laxis Network initiated the VWD Intern ational Proph ylaxis (VI P) trial to investigate the role of prophy laxis in patients with severe VWD including Ty pe 1, 2 , and3. The dose of the factor replaceme nt product was 50 IU /kgVWF:RCo. The frequency of the dose depended on the t ype of bleeding and could be increased from once weekl y to twice weekl y or3times per week. For the treatment of men orrhagia the dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo was given on the first day of m enses for 2 cy cles. The f requency could be increased to D ay 1 and 2 for 2 cy cles or to Day 1, 2, and 3 of menses . The study contains both retrospective and prospective study components. Results from theretrospective study component were published, including 61subjects on prophy lactic regimen in the past 6 months prior to enrollment or subjects with a history of prophy laxis over at least 6 month .10Differences in annualized bleeding rates (ABR) within individuals (during prophylaxis – before proph ylaxis) were significant for those with primary indications of epistaxis (P = 0.0005), joint bleeding (P = 0.002) and GI bleeding (P = 0.001). The difference in the group whose primary indication for treatment was abnormally heavy bleeding at menstruation (n = 4) was not significant (P = 0.25). The reduction of mucosal bleeding likel y not onl y dependen tson normal circulating levels of active VWF, but also on the presence of discrete concentrations of normal VWF inside the platelets and within endothelial matrices. The low subject number (n=4) and the treatment scheme for menorrhagia on Days 1, 2, and 3 o f menses which might represent rather on-demand than prophy lactic treatment may also account for the outcome in this study .

Six subjects had ty pe 2A, and 5subjects had ty pe 3 VWD. Sixsubjects presen ted with epistaxis, 3 with GI bleeding, and 2with joint bleeding. Seven subjects had dose escalation above the first level. Among the 10 subjects with evaluable bleeding log data, the use of prophy laxis decreased the median ABR from 25 to 6.1 (95% confide nce interval [CI] of the rate difference: -51.6 to - 1.7), and the median ABR was even lower (4.0; 95% CI : -57.5 to - 5.3) when the subjects reached their final dosing level. The authors concluded that this was the first prospective study to demonstrate that proph ylaxis with VWF concentrates is highl y effective in reducing mucosal and joint bleeding rates in clinicall y severe VWD. The results of the VI P study and previous investigations suggest that VWD patients with recurrent bleeding episodes and severe menorrhagia will benefit from a proph ylactic VWF replacement therapy . There is evidence that up to 40% of patients with ty pe 3 VWD experience joint bleeding which can lead to hemophilic arthropath y. Other potential indications for prophy laxis include patients with ty pe 2A or 2B VWD with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, menorrhagia or frequent epistaxis .4Long-term prophy laxis for most patients with ty pe 3 VWD and in some patients wi th type 1 or 2 VWD, depending on the pattern of bleeding, may be the treatment option of choice. Although the main experience with long -term prophy laxis is with secondary prophy laxis, primary proph ylaxis starting at young age is recommended to prevent art hropathy in patients with severe VWD.12 However, furthe r studies are needed to develop evidence -based guidelines for prophy lactic treatment in VWD. 6.4Population sto be Studied A total of approximately 22eligible , adult subjects with severe VWD (baseline VWF:RCo <20 IU/dL) are planned to be enrolled . Two cohorts of patients will be included : patients currently receiving on -demand VWF treatment (OD subjects) and patients currentl y on prophylactic treatment with pdVWF (pdVWF switch subjects) , and the aimis to have ≥8 subjects in each of the 2 cohorts, with a total of at least 5 type 3 VWD subjects followed for 12 months. Enrolled subjects (i .e., subjects who have signed the informed consent form) will be eligible to participate in the study if they meet all of the inclusion criteria (see Section 9.1) and none of the exclusion criteria (see Section 9.2).

Potential risks and efficacy of rVWF (vonicog alfa) :ADVATE (rFV III, octocog alfa) are summarized in the following sections. For additional information on nonclinical and clinical Phase 1 results ref er to the rVWF (vonicog alfa) IB. 6.5.1 Findings from Nonclinical Studies 6.5.1.1 Primary Pharmacodynamics Efficacy of rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was shown in VWD animal models, which have also low endogenous FVIII levels. Time to occlusion and stable th rombus formation was asse ssed in the carotid occlusion model in VWD mice. The results demonstrated that rVWF (vonicog alfa) in combination with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) acted efficientl y in a dose -depend ent manner and had higher efficacy than rVWF (vonicog alfa) alone or plasma derived ( pd)VWF. These results were confirmed in an additional study assessing blood loss and survival in a tail tip bleeding model in VW D mice . In a VWD dog , rVWF (vonicog alfa) stabilized canine FVIII in the circulation and significa ntly reduced the bleeding time. 6.5.1.2 Safety Pharmacology The anaph ylactoid and thrombogenic potential of the co -infusion of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) and rVWF (vonicog alfa) and the co- infused product’s effects on blood pressure, cardiac and respiratory function and parameters of coagulation activation were investigated in 4 in vivo studies in different animal models. Safety pharma cology studies in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits ,and dogs revealed no risks for anaph ylactoid and thrombogenic potential of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in combination with rVWF (vonicog alfa) . All observations in safety pharmacology studies are considered to lie within the biological variability of an imal models or occurred due to known species - specific anaph ylactoid effects of excipients .

Human rVWF (vonicog alfa) stabilized the endogenous FVIII in VWD mice, VWD pigs ,and VWD dogs. Furthermore, the h ypotheses that the area under the curve ( AUC )with rVWF alone and rVWF+ ADVATE is not inferior to the AUC with pdVWF (Haemate P) was tested and confirmed statistically in normal rats. ThePK characteristics of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) were not affected by co- administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa) in cy nomolgus monkey s. The PK data in the FVIII knock out (k.o.) mice model are inconclusive and might not be relevant for the clinical situation. However, a stabilizing effect of VWF on FVIII could be shown in a double k.o. model in a dose depend ent manner. 6.5.1.4 Toxicology Single dose toxicity studies were conducted in C57 BL/6J -mice, VWD mice, rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkeys. Rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkey s showed no signs of toxicity . Signs of microthrombosis, an exaggerated pharmacological effect, were observed in mice. Mice are not capable of sufficiently cleaving the rVWF (vonicog alfa) subunit as murine disintegrin and m etalloproteinase with a thrombo spondin ty pe 1 motif, number 13 (ADAMTS13 )does not decrease the ultra -large molecular weight multimers of rVWF (vonicog alfa) .13The observed symptoms of microthrombosis are interpreted as aspecies -specific exaggerated pharmacological effect. Studies evaluating the safet y of repeated administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) (daily over 14 days) were performed in a rodent (rat) and non -rodent (cynomol gusmonkey ) species. Reversible signs of exaggerated pharmacological effects (regenerative anemia, thrombocy topenia, and treatment- related histopathologic changes in the heart, liver, and spleen) were observed in rats that were administered 1400 U VWF:RCo/ kg/day + 1080 IU ADVATE/kg/day intravenousl y once daily for 14 day s. Also, these findings are interpreted as a species -specific exaggerated pharmacological effect due to the low susceptibility of human rVWF (vonicog alfa) to cleavage by rodent ADAMTS13 .13Notoxicologicall y relevant changes were evident for clinical observations, bod y weight, feed consumption, ophthalmology , urinal ysis, coagulation , and serum chemistry parameters, platelet aggregation, and gross pathology. rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkey safter dail y intravenous ( i.v.)(bolus) administration of 100 U VWF:RCo/kg rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined with 77 IU/kg ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) over a period of 14 day s.

Therefore, 100 UVWF:RCo/kg/day rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without 77 IU/kg ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was considered the no observed adverse effect level (NOAE L)inthis study , which was the highest dose tested. Anti- drug antibodies, however, were formed in both species and resulted in a significant reduction in drug exposure after 14 applica tions as compared to a single application. These antibodies substantially reduced the sy stemic exposure to the test substance as compared to a single dose administration. No adverse effects due to antibody formation were observed in both species. rVWF (von icog alfa) combined with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was well tolerated locally and no genotoxic potential was evident after 2 in vitro and 1 in vivo genotoxicity study .A study on the influence of co- administration of VWF and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alf a)onthe immunogenicity of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in 3different hemophilic mouse models (E17 hemophilic Balb/c mice, E17 hemophilic C57BL/6J mice , and E17 hemophilic human F8 transgenic mice) showed that rVWF (vonicog alfa) does not negativel y impact the immunogenicit y of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in any of the three dif ferent hemophilic mouse models. 6.5.2 Findings from Clinical Studies Details on study design, populations enrolled, and safet y and efficacy outcomes of the phase 1 studies arepresented in Section 6.5.2.1 andSection 6.5.2.2, the phase 3 study in Section 6.5.2.3, and the phase 3 surgery study in Section 6.5.2.4.

The data generated in this phase 1 study suggest tha t rVWF: ADVATE up to the highest investigated dose of 50 IU /kgVWF:RCo is well tolerated and safe in adults with severe VWD. No thrombo genic risk or thrombotic thrombocy topenic purpura (TTP)-like syndrome was observed, and no neutralizing antibodies to VWF or FVIII were identified. There were no deaths or other serious adverse reactions, and no infusions were interrupted or stopped due to an AE. Overall, the reported AE profile was similar between the recombinant and plasma-derived concent rates. Secondar y endpoints were the PK assessment of VWF:RCo, von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag ) and multimeric composition of rVWF (vonicog alfa) as well as FVIII:C at standardized time points after single injections o f rVWF: ADVATE and pdVWF:FVIII. The median VWF:RCo terminal half-life (T 1/2)of rVWF (vonicog alfa) at the 50 IU/kg dose was 16 hours. T 1/2with pdVWF:FVIII at the same dose level appeared shorter at 12.58 hours, however, thelimits of the 90% CI were similar (11.73 to 17.7 hours vs. 11.87 to 18.03 hours). The median T1/2of VWF:RCo were shorter with the lower investigated doses: 7.13 hours and 13.23 hours with the 7.5 IU/kg and 20 IU/kg doses, although these data were derived from a much sm aller number of subjects. In consequence of the missing ADAMTS13 cleavage ,ultra-large molecular weight (ULMW) multimers are contained in the rVWF (vonicog alfa) final product. The immediate cleavage of these ultra -large multimers by ADAMTS13 upon release into the circulation could be demonstrated appl ying sodium dodecy l sulfate pol yacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) /Immunoblot with poly clonal an ti-VWF antibodies to detect the resulting rVWF (vonicog alfa) subunit cleavage fragments.

All subjects underwent 3 PK anal yses: the first after infusion with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) alone, the second after infusion with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) plus 10 IU/kg rVWF (vonicog alfa) and the third after infusion with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) plus 50 IU/kg rVWF (vonicog alfa) . The PK anal ysis was performed at intervals of approximately 8 to 14 day s. Before each infusion for PK assessment ,there wasa wash -out period of at least 5 day s and the subjects were not actively bleeding. Primary outcome measures indicate that co -administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa) slightly sustain ADVATE activity with the highest observed ADVATE (r FVIII, octocog alfa) half-life of 13.74 h (CI 11.44 to16.52) after co -infusion of 50 IU/ kg ADVATE plus 50 IU/kg rVWF :RCo . Thehighest improvement in ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) circulating half -life was observed in subjects with VWF:Ag levels below 100% which indicates an association between baseline VWF:Ag levels and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) half-life increase. No treatment related A Es or SAEs were reported . No subject withdrew due to an AE and there were no deaths. No binding antibodies to VWF, CHO ,and rFurin were detectable in the confirmatory assay and no signs of a h ypersensi ti vity to rVWF (vonicog alfa) or ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) antigen were observed. Laboratory values over time did not indicate an y potential safet y risk for hemophili a A patients treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa) and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in combination. In summary , the data indicate that rVWF (vonicog alfa) co-administered with ADVATE (rFV III, octocog alfa) up to the highest dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo is well tol erated and safe in hemophilia A patients.

The study consisted of 2parts (Part A and Part B). Part A consisted of PK assessments alone (Arm 2: PK50 onl y [without treatment of bleeding episodes]), or PK assessments (Arm 1: PK50 and Arm 3: PK80) plus on -demand treatment pe riod(s) of 6 months for bleeding episodes, or on -demand treatment for bleeding episodes only (Arm 4). Except for subjects in arm 2 who completed study after second PK assessment, subjects receiving treatment for PK assessments and/or bleeding episodes in Part A were to be entered into Part B to continue on-demand treatment for bleeding episodes for 6additional months for a total of 12 months in the study . The primary outcome measure was the number of subjects with “treatment success” (extent of control o f bleeding episodes), which was defined as a mean efficacy rating score of < 2.5 for a subject’s I P-treated bleeding episodes during the study . The rate of subjects with treatment success was 100% (Clopper -Pearson exact 90% CI: 84.7 to 100.0) for bleeds whe re the assessments were made prospectivel y and excluding GI bleeds. Sensitivity anal yses confirmed the r esults of the primary anal ysis. Crossover results at 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo showed that the PK profile for rVWF (vonicog alfa) VWF:RCo was independent of administration alone or with rFVIII (ADVATE , octocog alpha ) (T 1/2:19.4 hours for rVWF and 16.6 hours for rVWF:rFVIII; IR: 1.8 U/dL per IU/kg infused for both rVWF and rVWF:rFVIII; mean residence time ( MRT ): 26.7 hours for rVWF and 25.2 hours for rVWF:rFVIII). FVIII levels increased substantially with a median peak at 24 hours of 111.0 U/dL for rVWF:rFVIII and 86.0 U/dL after rVWF alone, indicating that rVWF (vonicog alfa) induces a sustained increase in endogenous FVIII activity . The rVWF (vonicog alfa) PK profile was comparable at 50 IU/kg and 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo, and repeated PK at 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo showed close agreement between pretreatment and end -of-study results.

Using 50 IU/kg for PK measurements, subjects in the 071001 study exhibiting a T1/2for rVWF of 14, 16 ,or 19 hours had rVWF plasma concentrations at 72 hours after administration of 2.55, 4.01, and 6.49% above baseline, respectivel y, and plasma concentrations at 96 hours after administration of 0.78, 1.40 , and 2.71% above baseline, respectivel y. In this context it should be noted that s ubjects in the present stud y who have significant spontaneous bleeding while on twice weekl y prophy laxis will have their regimen increase dto 3 times per week based on clear criteria for different bleeding locations ( for details s ee Section 8.6.4.3.1). Subjects in the present study who are switching from prophy laxis with a pdVWF product will begin on rVWF (vonicog alfa) using their same weekl y total dose in IU/kg VWF:RCo used during their pdVWF proph ylaxis divided into twice weekly infusions (for details see Section 8.6.4.3 ). A total of 125 AEs occurred in 25/37 (67.7%) subjects (62/318 infusions [19.5%]) during or after infusion with IP. Of these, 116/125 were non -serious (all mild or moderate; none were severe ), and 9 SAEs were reported in 7 subjects. Of 125 total AEs, 38 were temporally associated with I P; 8 AEs were considered causally related to I P: 6 non- serious related AEs (tach ycardia, infusion site paraesthesia, electrocardiogram [ECG ] t-wave inversion, dysgeusia, generalized pruriti s, and hot flush) occurred in 4 subjects, and 2 related SAEs (chest discomfort and incr eased heart rate) occurred in 1subject. No deaths occurred during this study . None of the subjects developed anti- VWF or anti -FVIII neutr alizing antibodies and no binding antibodies to VWF or rFurin, or antibodies against CHO protein or anti -Murine IgG were observed. No clinical or subclinical signs or symptoms of a thrombogenic event were observed in this study . Following an initial increa se in ultralarge VWF multimers after administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa), a notable decrease in the proportion of large VWF multimers occurred between 12 and 24 hours post infusion, due to degradation by the endogenous ADAMTS13 followed by a continued de cline until the end o f the 96- hour follow -up period. Overall, the data support the safe and effective use of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without rFVIII (ADVATE, octocog alpha ) in the treatment of bleeds in patients with VWD.

Eleven subjects underwent a PK assessment by infusion of 50 ± 5 IU/kg rVWF:RCo at an infusion rate of up to 4 mL/min. 12 to 24 hours before surgery , subjects received a dose of 40 to 60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo. Within 3 hours prior to surgery , the subject’s FVIII:C levels were assessed with a target of 30 IU/dL for minor and oral surgeries and 60 IU/dL for major surgeries. Within 1 hour prior to surgery, subjects received a dose of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) (depending on the target FVIII:C levels at the 3 hour assessment). VWF and FVIII IR and T 1/2for each subject, when known, were used to guide the initial dose and subsequent doses. The primary outcome measure was the overall assessment of hemostatic efficacy assessed b y the investigator (hemophilia physician) 24 hours after last perioperative IP infusion or at completion of day 14 visit, w hichever occurred earlier, and was summarized by the percentage of subjects in each efficacy category (“excellent”, “good”, “moderate” and “none”). Point estimate and corresponding 90% two -sided exact CI was calculated for the rate of subjects with an over all assessment of hemostatic efficacy . All 15subjects treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa) (with or without ADVATE) for major (10), minor (4), and oral (1) elective surgical procedures had overall hemostatic efficacy ratings of “excellent” or “good”. M ost (73.3%) subjects had “excellent” overall hemostatic efficacy ratings; of these, 7 underwent major surgery and 4 underwent minor surgery .

For the initial rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusion, the subject received a test dose of 5% of thetotal dose of 60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo at an infusion r ate of 1 mL/min. After a 10 to 15-minute observation period, no adverse sy mptoms or signs were noted and the subject received the remaining 95% of the total dose. The subject was monitored for an y signs of an allergic reaction, and none were noted. Treatm ent with rVWF (vonicog alfa) every 12to 24 hours was tocontinue at the discretion of the investigator based on VWF levels and clinical s ymptomatology . The subject had an excellent response and recovery , which allowed for daily dosing of rVWF (vonicog al fa)and, within 24 hours, the subject’s bleeding had stopped. Daily dosing of rVWF (vonicog alfa) was maintained and the subject received his last dose on . The subject also received rVWF (vonicog alfa) for 7 days for prophy laxis for surger y (surgical resection of a left- kidney mass). The subject experienced no hemorrhagic complications and no AEs that were considered related to the use of rVWF (vonicog alfa). 6.6Evaluation of Anticipated Risks and Benefits of the Investigational Product(s) to Human Subjects Current treatment of VWD patients relies on desmopressin and VWF products manufactured from pooled human plasma. Human VWF produced b y recombinant technology could offer a new perspective in treatment of VWD. The benefit for the individual subject is anticipated to be significant during this clinical stud y. He/she may benefit from a product that minimizes excessive FVIII administration and thus allowing individualized dosing of VWF at optimal levels . Variations in VWF multimeric composition may lead to variability with respect to treating or preventing bleeds in VWD subjects, especially mucosal bleeds which are especiall y problematic. rVWF (vonicog alfa) product manufactured by Baxalta consistently contains ULMW VWF multimers due to the fact that the product has not been exposed to ADAMTS13.

By using a recombinant product, the risk of transmission of adventitious agents and other blood -borne pathogens associated with the use of products of human or animal origin has been eliminated. At this stage of product developmen t, the key societal benefit is a better understanding of advanced treatment options for VWD and enhanced product availability .

For pdVWF switch subjects, the rVWF (vonicog alfa) prophy laxis initiation treatment visit should occur within 42 days after the completion of screening procedures and confirmation of eligibility . At this visit subjects will receive their proph ylaxis initiation dose .The proph ylaxis do se s are described in Section 8.6.4.3 . The subj ect will be trained on I P reconstitution and administration and may then qualif y for home treatment (see Section 8.6.4.3.2).

Examples of all dosing schedules are provided in Table 1. For pdVWF swit ch subjects, the weekl y dose (IU/kg) of IP for each patient will be equivalent (± 10%) to the weekl y VWF dose received during proph ylactic treatment with pdVWF. The weekl y dose of IP should be divided into 2 infusions ( Table 1, Schedule A), with a maximum of 80 IU/kg/infusion. If needed ,based on the total weekly dose or other clinical judgements, the weekl y dose may be given as three infusions (Table 1, Schedule B).

Dose and frequency adjustments should be agreed with the sponsor in advance unless it constitutes an urgent safet y measure . The rationale for dosing adjustments need sto be documented in the subject’s medical record . For both OD and switch patients, dose escalations (not exceeding the upper dose limit of 80 IU/kg rVWF:RCo) and increase of dose frequency will only be allowed in case of insufficient therapeutic response with breakthrough bleeding episodes. The c riteria for dose and /orfrequency escalation are specific to each bleeding indication but, overall, involve 1 significant breakthrough bleeding episode despite the subject being compliant with scheduled proph ylaxistreatment . For switch patients who require a dose escalation due to a breakthrough bleed, the frequency should be kept the same but the dose (IUVWF:RCo per infusion) should be increased up to 80 I U VWF:RCo. Following that, increases in frequency may be considered upon consultation with the Sponsor. For on demand subjects who require a dose escalation, at the discretion of the PI upon consultation with the Sponsor, the frequency may be kept the same but the dose (IUVWF:RCo per infusion) should be increased up to 80 I U VWF:RCo. I f this proves to be insufficient, th en the dosing frequ ency may be increased in these subjects. Table 2 presents the criteria for dosing escalation per each bleeding indication taken 50 ± 10 IU VWF:RCo/kg twice weekly dose as an example of subject’s assigned starting dose. The criteria are applicable for both OD and switch subjects who were initially assigned to twice weekly dosing .Subjects entering the study will begin proph ylaxis treatm ent according to Schedule A ( Table 1)and will remain at this dose and frequency until meeting the criteria for escalation to the next higher schedule : for example, from 2 infusions of 50 ± 10 IUVWF:RCo/kg/week to 3 infusions of 50 ± 10 IU VWF:RCo/kg/week (Schedule B) to achieve an adequate therapeutic response .If a subject started with a weekly dose (possible for switch subjects), similar criteria wo uld apply except that the subject will be excalated to twice weekl y dosing if frequency change is necessary .

If a subject experiences a bleed while receiving rVWF (vonicog alfa) three times per week, the investigator should treat the bleed with rVWF (vonicog alfa) at doses up to 80IU VWF:RCo/kg at a frequency determined by the investigator until the bleed resolves. Upon resolution of the bleeding event, the subject will return to their assigned prophy laxis regimen. Itis essential for the success of this study that the subjects adhere to treatment regimens . Therefore, procedures for monitoring subject’s compliance are implemented (see Section 10.7) . If 1infusion of IP is missed, the subject may administer the I P as soon as possible .The subject should adhere to the irtreatment scheme ensuring a minimum interval of 12 hours between this and the previous I P infusion. For example ,a subject routinel y infuses I P on Monday and Thursday ,he/she misses the Monday time point and therefore may infuse the IP on the next day (Tuesday )and thereafter proceed with infusing the IP on Thursday (considering a minimum 12 hours between the infusions )and return to the initial schedule.

In the event a healthcare professional is requi red to administer IP, he/she must be trained and qualified by the investigator on the above procedures prior to the decision for home treatment. A Subject Guideline detailing all instructions and information listed above will be provided to each subject. 8.6.4.4 Treatment of Bleeding Episodes 8.6.4.4.1 General Instructions for Home Treatment of Bleeding Episodes If a subject experiences a bleeding episode, he/she should contact the study site immediately and the site investigator should provide instructions on the treatment regimen. If the subject initiates the treatment at home, he/she should at least follow up with the study site if avisit is needed as per the standard of care at the center . In the event a healthcare professional is required to administer treatment at the subject’s home, he/she must be trained and qualified b y the site investigator on the above procedures prior to the decision for home treatment. Once a subject has received 1infusion of rVWF (vonicog alfa) in the clinic (either during planned IP exposure or during the t reatment o f a bleeding episode) and meets the criteria for home treatment, the treatment of bleeding episodes with I P can be conducted at home (see Section 8.6.4.3.2). If a subject is not qualified for home treatment, rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusions must be administered at the study site. If a subject experiences a bleeding episode that re quires treatment between the screening and the proph ylaxis initiation visit , the subject will be treated with I P (rVWF with or without ADVATE ). Treatment with I P must occur at the study site unless the subject has previously qualified for home treatment with rVWF (vonicog alfa) . If rVWF (vonicog alfa) treatment is not feasible, the subject may use his/her standard of care, such as commercial pdVWF/FVIII products. In any case a washout period of at least 5 day s is required prior to rVWF (vonicog alfa) PK infusion at the initial PK assessment visit for on-demand subjects . If a subject experiences a bleeding episode requiring treatment during the PK assessment, rVWF (vonicog alfa) should be used to treat the bleed . Bloo d draws for PK assessment will be stopped and the PK assessments will be repeated once the bleed has resolved and the subject is free of an y symptoms related with the bleeding episode . Dose and frequency of rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusions or any other replac ement therapy to stop the bleed should be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ), and the reason for the use of any non -IP product or therapy should be documented .

It is the sponsor’s opinion that, in many cases, treatment with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) may not be necessary, since rVWF (vonicog alfa )proph ylaxis will serve to increase endogenous FVIII levels. However, if endogenous FVIII is below 30-40 % or is unknown and cannot be estimated from the subject’s PK study , an infusion of rVWF: ADVATE at anrVWF: ADVATE ratio of 1.3:1± 0.2 should be administered initially . Subsequent infusion sshould be with rVWF:RCo 40 to 60 I U/kg with or , in many cases, without 30 to 45 I U/kg ADVATE (only to be administered if plasma FVIII levels fall below 30 IU/L during the treatment period) . Dosing may be adjuste d downward or upward up to 80 IU/kg rVWF at the treating ph ysician’s discretion based upon the subject’s prior history , PK and other factors. If FVIII levels are not available, dosing is at the discretion of the investigator based upon the individual subje ct’s PK data. Using ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in addition to rVWF (vonicog alfa) in subsequent doses carries the risk of an excessive rise in FVIII:C. Therefore, reduced doses of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) and/or prolongation of the dose interval should be considered. The following is general guidance and the sponsor’s suggestion for treatment of breakthrough bleeds, however each PI will determine the treatment based on the local acceptable practice how to monitor and adjust treatment for a bleeding episode. An effort should be made to discuss with the sponsor (or sponsor’s delegate) the treatment strategy . In general the aim of the initial dose should be full replacement of VWF with VWF:RCo levels of >0 .6IU/ml (60%) and FVIII:C of > 0.4 IU/mL (40%). In major bleeding episodes ,subsequent doses should keep the trough level of VWF:RCo >50% for 3 day s and then as deemed necessary by the investigator for subsequent days. In moderate bleeding episodes ,the dose and trough level may be reduced to >30% for as long as deemed necessary by the investigator. Treatment for minor bleeding episodes will generall y consist of only 1 or 2 doses of rVWF (vonicog alfa) IP. If the VWF:RCo level is above 150%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 12 hours; i f the VWF:RCo level is above 200%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 24 hours. In either case, a lower subsequent dose (e.g., 20 IU/kg VWF:RCo) may be appropriate. Dosing recommendations are listed in Table 3. For non-commercial use only"

A diagnosis of menorrhagia will be defined by a prospectively completed Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) score >185 and normal cervical cytology or requiring use of a VWF -containing concentrate for treatment of excessiv e menstrual bleeding for at least one menstrual cycle during the prior year. Variances of up to 10% in dosing are permissible during treatment of bleeding episodes, but rounding to the nearest vial size should be avoided. Subjects with non- neutralizing binding anti -VWF antibodies should initially be treated with a dose known to be efficacious based on the subject’s medical treatment history which may differ from the recommendations provided in Table 3. Subjects should be monitored for lack of efficacy as well as for FVIII (mandatory ), VWF:RCo (m andatory ), and VWF:Ag (optional where testing is not available) levels after 3 to 6 hours. Re -dosing with rVWF (vonicog alfa) in combination with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) using the same (initial) dose and adaptation of the dosing frequency should be considered until cessation of the bleed, if the FVIII and/or VWF:RCo levels drop below 30% -50% depending on bleeding severity .

Subjects who at time of screening have an alread y scheduled surgical intervention are not eligible for participation in the study . 8.6.4.5.1 Major, Minor and Oral Surger y Definition The following definitions and criteria are used to serve as a guidance for major, minor and oral surgery . Major surgeries generally refer to major orthopedic surgery (e.g., joint replacement, arthroscopic or open s ynovectomy , arthrodesis, hardware removals like plates or intramedullary nails, etc.), major abdominal surgery (e.g. open or laparoscopic hernioplasty , cholecy stectomy , colon or small bowel resection, etc.), major gy necological surgery (e.g. open or laparoscopic m yomectom y, hysterecto my, removal of endometriosis, poly ps, cysts, adhesioly sis, etc.), major head and neck surgery (e.g.: tonsillectomy , adenoidectomy , rhinoplast y, lymphadenectomy, th yroidectomy , parotidectom y. etc.), an y intracranial , cardiovascular or spinal surgery and an y other surgery which has a significant risk of large volume blood loss or blood loss into a confined anatomical space. Extraction of impacted third molars is generall y also considered major surgery due to the expected difficulty of surgery and the expecte d blood loss. Minor surgeries generally refer to interventions such as placement of intravenous access devices, removal of small skin lesions, arthroscopy, gastroscop y, colonoscopy or conisation. Oral surgeries comprise extractions of fewer than three teet h, if the teeth are non -molars and have no bon y involvement. A summary schedule of visit assessments and laboratory sampling is included in Supplement tables in Section 20.2.1 and Section 20.3.1. For non-commercial use only"

As a general guidance a priming dose of 40 -60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo will be administered .If not assessed prior to the preoperative priming dose, a IR recovery may be calculated for subjects undergoing minor and oral surgery . 8.6.4.5.3 Preoperative Loading Dose An rVWF (vonicog alfa) loading dose should be administed within 3 hours before surgery . VWF and FVIII levels should be assessed within 3 hours prior to surgery initiation and results must be available prior to administering the loading dose. If FVIII levels prior to loading dose administration are not at least 30 IU/dL (minor, oral surgery ), or 60 IU/dL (major sur gery) ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) will be administered in addition to rVWF (vonicog alfa) in order to raise FVIII:C levels to recommended levels. The preoperative loading dose will be calculated as the difference in the target peak and baseline plasma VW F:RCo levels divided by the IR (ΔVWF:RCo x BW (kg) /IR) . The PK results will be provided prior to the planned surgery . If the IR is not available, assume an IR of 1.7 IU/dL per IU/kg and calculate the initial dose as follows: (100 –baseline plasma VWF:RCo )x BW (kg) / 1.7. For minor and oral surgery , the IR from the Preoperative Priming Dose visit will be used to guide dosing and the target peak is 50-60 IU/dL VWF:RCo and 40 -50 IU/dL FVIII. For major surgery , the target peak is 100IU/dL VWF:RCo and 80-100 IU/dL FVIII. The surgery may only start after normalization of the activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT). 8.6.4.5.4 Intra- and Postoperative (maintenance) Dosing After the preoperative loading dose(s), subjects who have not achieved the desired postinfusion recovery will continue to receive rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) as a bolus infusion, depending on VWF and FVIII levels. The peri -and post -operative substitution regimen will be individualized according to the PK results, intensity and duration of the hemostatic challenge, and the institution’s standard of care.

Subjects undergoing oral surgery will be infused with rVWF (vonicog alfa) at least once within the f irst 8- 12 hours, targeting ≥30 IU/dL (rVWF and FVIII). Subjects undergoing major surgery will be infused with rVWF (vonicog alfa) every 12-24 hours for at least the first 72 hours post -surgery , targeting a VWF:RCo and FVIII:C trough plasma leve l >50 IU/dL, followed by further treatment post-72 hours for as long as deemed necessary by the Investigator, targeting a VWF:RCo and FVIII:C trough plasma level of ≥30 IU/dL . Dose modifications based on pre -infusion VWF/FVIII levels will be performed as needed. For subsequent infusions post surger y, in case pre -infusion levels are not available prior to the consecutive infusion in a timely manner, pre -infusion levels from the previous dose may be used by the investigator for dosing guidance. Peak plasma level guidance is matching to Section 8.6.4.4.2 A schedule of all perioperative visit assessments and laboratory sampling can be found in supplement t ables in Section 20.2.1 and Section 20.3.1. 8.6.4.6 Thrombosis P rophylaxis Thromboembolic events have been reported in patients who have VWD, especiall y in the setting of known risk factors for thrombosis including low ADAMTS13 levels . Therefore, subjects who are at risk for developing thromboembolic events should be monitored for earl y signs of thrombosis, and prophylaxis measures against thromboembolism should be instituted according to current recommendations and standard of care . For all subjects who are VWD patients and are receiving VWF concentrate, attention should be given to avoid exceeding maximal recommended plasma activity levels of VWF:RCo (250 IU/dL) and FVIII (250 IU/dL). Anticoagulation measures, such as heparin, are accep table and should follow study site standards. The investigator will record the use and reasons for such measures/agents on the appropriate CRF.

For example, the third subject who signed an informed consent form at stud y site 02 will be identified as Subject 071301- 020003. All study documents (e . g., CRFs, clinical documentation, sample containers, drug accountability logs, etc.) will be identified with the SI C. Additionally , a uniquely coded SI C(s) is permitted as long as it does not contain a combination of information that allows identification of a subject (e . g., collection of a subject’s initials and birth date would not be permitted), in compliance with laws governing data priv acy. 10.3 Screening and Study Visits The study site is responsible for maintaining a screening log that includes all subjects who provided informed consent . The log also will serve to document the reason for screening failure. All screening data will be collect ed and reported in CRF, regardless of screening outcome. If a subje ct is re -screened, the End of Study CRF should be completed, and a new ICF, new SIC and new CRF are required for that subject. The overall study design is illustrated in the Figure 1. Details on the procedures to be performed at each stud y visit, including screening, are provided in Supplement 20.2 “Schedule of Stud y Procedures and Assessments ”and Supplement 20.3 “Clinical Laboratory Assessments ” . 10.3.1 Scre ening V isit Written informed consent must be obtained from each subject before an y study related procedures are performed. During the screening, site staff would be required to collect all details including date, location, t ype, severity and treatment received for all spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes occurring within the past 12 months. The maximum interval of bleed -free periods as well as trauma- induced bleeding episodes will also be recorded (prospectively and retrospectively ). Study site personnel would be trained and qualified about which information should be obtained from diary, chart andpharmacy records, along with an y other applicable site source documentation.

All ty pes of bleeds, including tra umatic bleeds, will be recorded. Bleeding episodes should be organized by where they occur in addition to whether they occurred spontaneously or due to a traumatic event. Bleeds occurring at the same anatomical location ( e.g., right knee) with the same etiology (i.e., spontaneous versu s injury ) within 24 hours after onset of the first bleed will be considered a single bleed. Bleeding occurring at multiple locations related to the same injury (e.g., knee and ankle bleeds following a fall) will be counted as a single bleeding episode. All efforts should be made to use rVWF (vonicog alfa) for treatment of bleeding episodes. If needed , the use of a VWF concentrate other than IPfor the treatment of bleeding episodes will not disqualify the subject from further participation in the study . For non-commercial use only"

An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign ( e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom (e.g., rash, pain, discomfort, fever, dizziness, etc.) , disease (e.g., peritonitis, bacteremia, etc.),or outcome of death temporally associated with the use of an IP, whether or not considered causall y related to the I P. 12.1.1.1 Serious Adverse Event A nSAE is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that ,at an y dose, meets one or more of the following criteria: Outcome is fatal/results in death (including fetal death) Is life -threatening – defined as an event in which the subject was, in the judgment of the investigator, at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that h ypotheticall y might ha ve caused death had it been more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization –inpatient hospitalization refers to any inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay . Results in persistent or sign ificant disability /incapacity (i.e.,a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) Is acongenital anomal y/birth defect Is a medicall y important event –a medical event t hat may not be immediately life-threatening or resu lt in death or require hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definitions above. Examples of such events are (including but not limited to) : Intensi ve treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood d yscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependence or drug abuse Reviewed and confirmed seroconversion for HIV, hepatitis A viru s (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), or parvovirus B19 (B19V) For non-commercial use only"

However, when there is an increase in the severit y, duration, or frequency of a preexisting disease, the event must be described as “worsening” of the pre- existing condition on the AE CRF. 12.1.2 Assessm ent of Adverse Events For the purposes of this study , the following will not be considered as AEs and will not be included in the analy sis of AEs. Bleeding episodes are part of the underl ying disease and therefore are not AEs; they will be evaluated in the context of efficacy . For non -serious bleeding episode scaused b y an injury, the injury would not be reported as an AE, unless it resulted in a medical finding other than a bleeding episode (e.g., abrasion of ski n). Therefore, any VWD -related bleeding event (e.g., epistaxis, gas trointestinal bleeding, musculo -skeletal bleeding, menorrhagia) that is non -serious will not be reported as an AE. However, the investigator may decide that the event is an AE if the event also would have occurred in a healthy individual under the same circumstances.  For serious bleeding episodes (bleeding SAEs ): Bleeding events that meet seriousness criteria (death, life -threatening, hospitalizing/prolongation of hospitalization, disability , congenital anomal y, or medically signi ficant andif not urgentl y treated would result in one of the above) should be captured on the SAE eCRF andreported as an SAE to the Sponsor or designee (e.g., CRO) on an SAE Report form as described in Section 12.1.2.3 (Safet y Reporting) . Seroconversion after documented HAV/HBV vaccination prior to or during the study period.

Testing will be done prior to I P infusion and with at least a 72hour wash out period since the last I P infusion. If there is any suspicion of inhibitor development (e.g. excessive bleeding) binding and neutralizing antibodies to VWF and FVIII may be tested at the discretion of the investigator. 12.9.3.2 Neutralizing and Total Binding Anti -VWF Antibodies The assay s to establish the presence of neutralizing and total binding anti -VWF antibodies have been established in the absence of international standards and with only limited numbers of positive controls. Therefore, caution is advised in interpreting positive results. I n particular, any clinical association, changes in the natural history of the disease, effect of therapy, etc. needs to be taken into account for final judgment. Thesponsor’s Medical Director should be consulted for additional advice. As part of the AE follow -up, an y sample testing positive needs to be confirmed after 2 -4 weeks for central lab oratory testing. Only confirmed neutralizing anti -VWF antibodies are considered inhibitors (see Section 12.9.3.4) . These subjects need to be closely monitored and therap y adjusted accordingl y. 12.9.3.3 Binding antibodies to VWF The presence of total binding anti -VWF antibodies will be determined b y an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) employ ing poly clonal anti -human Immunoglobulin (Ig)antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA). For this assay (ELI SA), recombinant human VWF will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then inc ubated with dilutions of the positive control, the negative control or test sample. Antibodies against human VWF that are present in the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -coupled goat anti- human ant ibody (secondary antibody ). The positive control for this assay will be a human monoclonal antibody specific for human VWF spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human plasma. Plasma samples are analy zed for binding antibodies against the specific antigen in two steps. First, the sample is screened for antibodies and the titer of binding antibodies is determined. Second, the specificit y of positive antibody results is confirmed.16 Inbrief, all samples are serially diluted (initial dilution 1:20 and further diluted 1:2). For non-commercial use only"

The cut off level is established based on background signal level of healthy plasma donors (n=160) and set to include 5% false positives to be as sensitive as possible (95% percentile). The ELISA assay is validated allowing a nassay variability of ± 1 titer step. Therefore, differences ≤ 2 titers steps may be due to variability of the ELISA assay. Specificity has to be confirmed in a competition assay when a sample has a titer of 1:80 or higher in the screening assay . Based on the validation criteria samples tested in the screening assay at 1:20 or 1:40 cannot be confirmed in the competition assay . A positive sc reening value is confirmed if the difference between the titers determined for the subject sample (re -screen) and for the subject sample with pre -incubation (confirmation sample) is > 2 titer steps. Antibody titers of subject samples will only be reported as positive, if the results of the screening and confirmatory anal ysis fulfill these acceptance criteria. The titer to be reported is alway s the one determined in the original screening procedure (independent of the result of the re -screening in the confirmation procedure). A more detailed test procedure will be supplied upon request or pro -actively if a sample tests positive. A treatment related increase of the binding anti -VWF antibodies is expected, if the titer increases b y more than 2 titration steps. These subjects need to be closely monitored and therapy adjusted accordingly . 12.9.3.4 Neutralizi ng A ntibodies to VWF Three functional VWF assay s, VWF:CB, VWF:RCo and VWF:FVIIIB assay s, will be used to test for the presence of neutralizing anti-VWF antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies to VWF:RCo, VWF:CB and VWF:FVIIIB activities will be measured b y assay s based on the Bethesda assay established for quantitative analy sis of FVIII inhibitors (Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay ).17The amount of inhibitor is expressed as BU per mL. One BU is thereb y defined as the amount of inhibitor that decreases the measured activity in the assay s to 50% of that of the negative control samples. The assay s were validated using human plasma samples from two type 3 VWD patients with low (1-2 BU/mL) and high (~10 BU/mL) titer inhibitors and plasma samples from non-human primates immunized with human rVWF (vonicog alfa) (>100 BU/mL) . If a subject has a measurable baseline level of VWF activity in the respective assay , it is taken into account in the calculation of the residual acti vity. However, if baseline levels are too high (>15% VWF:RCo), inhibitors may not be reliabl y detected. For non-commercial use only"

To verify a FVIII inhibitor, additional testing (such as tests for L upus anticoagulants) may be initiated. Positive FVIII inhibitor tests will be defined as ≥ 0.4 BU b y the Nijmegen -modified Bethesda assay that is confirmed b y a second test performed on an independent sample obtained 2- 4 weeks following the first test.

The genetic testing will be done, when the subject consents to the genetic testing. 12.9.9 Blood Group Analysis The blood group needs to be determined during the screening period. If the information is not alread y available in the subject’s medical history , it has to be determined at the local lab. 12.9.10 Additional Laboratory Testing in C ase of Thrombo embolic Events rVWF (vonicog alfa) contains UL MW multimers because of a lack of exposure to endogenous VWF protease ( a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 ( ADAMTS13) during the manufacturing process. In vitro and in vivo cleavage of these ultrala rge molecular fractions by ADAMTS13 and generation of characteristic satellite bands has been extensively demonstrated during nonclinical and clinical development. Nevertheless, the potential elevated risk of thrombosis and/or other thromboembolic complications due to the administration of ultra large molecular VWF multimers in subjects with normal levels of VWF cannot be completely excluded. Therefore VWF multimer anal ysis will not only be performed routinel y at screening but in case of thromboembolic even ts,both VWF multimer anal ysis as well as ADAMTS13 activity will be determined to assess an y relatedness of these occurrences with I P treatment.

High -resolution SDS –agarose gel electrophoresis, with agarose concentrations 1.5%, will be used to determine the satellite band structure of VWF. Thes e anal yses will employ Western blot with luminescence video imaging. 12.9.10.2 ADAMTS13 Activity VWF73 was identified as the 73 amino acid minimal region of the VWF A2 domain required for ADAMTS13 cleavage. The cleavage of this substrate will be detected b y a comme rciall y available ELISA -based Chromogenic assay (Technoclone Austria): Cleavage of immobilized VWF73 substrate is detected b y a HRP -labeled antibody directed against the cleavage site of VWF73. The amount of bound antibody, which is the function of the ADA MTS13 cleavage is detected by a chromogenic substrate . 12.9.11 Soluble P -Selectin (sP -Selectin) sP-selectin is a cell adhesion molecule (CAM) found in granules in endothelial cells (cells lining blood vessels) and activated platelets. Data for an association betwe en the sP-selectin concentration, TTP and venous thromboembolism (VTE ) are limited and the predictive value has not y et established. Acommercial ELISA assay will be employ ed as an exploratory test. sP -selectin will be determined at the Screening visit and used as indicator for an increased thrombotic risk. 12.9.12 D- Dimer D-dimer will be used as a marker for DVT and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) . While a negative result practically rules out thrombosis, a positive result can indicate thrombosis but does not rule out other potential etiologies, including a recent hemorrhage. Its main use, therefore, is to exclude thromboembolic disease where the probability is low. D -Dimer will be measured at the Screening visit and used as indicator for an increased thrombotic risk. 12.9.13 Additional Laboratory Testing in C ase of Severe Hypersensitivity R eactions If a subject develops a severe hypersensitivity reaction in the course of the clinical study ,additional blood will be drawn for anti-VWF IgE antibod y testing. Thepresence of anti-VWF IgE will be determined by using the ImmunoCAP®, a VWF -specific IgE blood test (Thermo Scientific). The basis of the ImmunoCAP® technology isa cellulose polymer as solid phase in a plastic capsule providing a large surface for protein binding. rVWF (vonicog alfa) as antigen is covalently coupled to the cellulose polymer.

Each other laboratory value (except results to determine genetics of the underly ing VWD disease and blood group) has to be assessed b y the invest igator and the assessment will be recorded on the eCRF . The investigator will determine for each abnormal laboratory value whether the value is considered clinically significant or not and provide the reference range including the units . For clinicall y significant values, the investigator will indicate if the value constitutes a new AE (see definition in Section 12.1) and record the sign, s ymptom, or medical diagnosis on the AE CRF , is a sy mptom or related to a previously recorded AE, is due to a pre -existing disease (described in Section 12.1.1.5), or is due to another issue that will be specified. If the abnormal value was not clinically significant, the investigator will indicate the reason, i .e.because it is due to a preexisting disease, due to a lab error, due to variati on or due to another issue that will be specified. Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significa nce or etiology of an abnormal value , or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained when clinically indicated. An y abnormal value that persists should be followed at the discretion of the investigator. Any abnormal laboratory value that is considered clinicall y significant b y the investigator based on a local laboratory test result (reference range and the units to be provided) should be confirmed by a central laboratory test result for which the sample is drawn/collected within 24 hours of the abnormal finding by the local laboratory .

BACKGROUND INFORMATIO N 6.1 Description of Investigational Product Baxalta US Inc. (here after referred to as Baxalta or sponsor) has developed a human recombinant von Willebrand Factor (rVWF , vonicog al fa), which is co -expressed with recombinant factor VIII (r FVIII )in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line and separ ated during the subsequent downstream process. To address concerns regarding the risk of transmission of blood -bornepathogens that may be introduced by human plasma, no exogenousl y added raw materials of human or animal origin are employed in the cell culture, purification, or formulation of the final container product. The only proteins present in the final container product other than rVWF (vonicog alfa) are trace quantities of murine immunoglobulin (IgG, from the immunoaffinity purification), host cell (i .e., CHO) protein, rFurin (used to further process rVW F). rVWF (vonicog alfa) is intended for the treatment of von Willebrand disease (VWD). rVWF (vonicog alfa) has been developed under the Baxalta internal code BAX111 and is used as investigational product (I P) in this study . rVWF (vonicog alfa) may be used with or without ADVATE (rFVIII , octocog alfa ) for the treatm ent of bleeding episodes (see Section 8.6.4.4). See Section 8.6for further information on the I Ps and their usage in this study . A detailed description of rVWF (vonicog alfa) is also provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). rVWF (vonicog alfa) was granted licensure in the United States in December 2015 under the brand name VONVENDI for the on- demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes in adults diagnosed with VWD ; as of the date of this protocol VONVENDI is not y et available on the market. 6.2Clinical Condition/Indication Von Willebran d Factor ( VWF )is a large multimeric gl ycoprotein with a molecular weight that varies from 500 to 20,000 kDa. VWF is normally found in plasma and produced in the alpha -granules of platelets and in endothelial cell organelles known as the Weibel -Palade bodi es. VWF mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular injury , one of the key functions in primary hemostasis. VWF also serves to stabilize coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), where FVIII is an essential cofactor of secondary hemostasis, whic h leads to fibrin clot formation.2Qualitative and/or quantitative deficiencies of VWF lead to a highl y variable bleeding diathesis known as VWD, the most common of the hereditary coagulation factor deficiencies. Penetrance of VWD is highly variable, with only a small fraction of mildly affected patients display ing clinical sy mptoms or a family history of a bleeding diathesis. For non-commercial use only"

Up to 70% of VWD patients are diagnosed with ty pe 1 VWD, which may also be associated with minor functional defects in the molecule. In general, patients with ty pe 1 VWD display mild clinical sy mptoms. Approximately 20 to 30% of VWD patients are diagnosed with ty pe 2 VWD. Ty pe 2 VWD is further divided into 4 subty pes (A, B, N, and M), reflecting distinct classes of functional abnormalities. These defects result in abnormal functional and/or multimeric distribution patterns that facilitate their diagnosis. The bleeding diathesis is usually moderate and primarily affects the mucosal tissues. Type 2N VWD patients are sometimes misdiagnosed as mild hemophilia A. Finally , approximately 1% percent of VWD patients exhibit a total o r near total absence of VWF, which is classified as t ype 3 VWD. The incidence of ty pe 3 VWD is estimated at 0.5-1.0 x 106. This ty pe is also associated with a ve ry low FVIII level (t ypically <5%) because the VWF carrier function for FVIII is lost. Replacem ent of VWF alone stabilizes endogenous FVIII, resulting in hemostatic levels withi n several hours post -infusion. Published results from studies of a plasma- derived VWF (pdVWF) concentrate demonstrated an increase of FVIII at an approximate rate of 5.8 1 IU dL-1h-1.3Type 3 VWD patients display severe hemorrhagic s ymptoms with bleeding predominantly in mucosal tissues, muscle and joints. All VWD patients, particularl y those with t ype 2 or type 3 VWD, are at an increased risk for life- threatening bleeding episodes. 6.3The Role of Prophylaxis in the M anagement of VWD The goals of long term prophy laxis in VWD are to maintain VWF and FVIII at sufficient levels to reduce the frequency and duration of bleeding episodes, the need for red blood cell transfusions, and the risk of complications, such as arthropath y.4In contrast to hemophilia ,routine prophy laxis is not as established in VWD , although prophy laxis for patients with severe VWD was in use in Sweden alread y during the 1950s .5In those earl y days of VWD treatment, plasma FVIII concentrates containing VWF fractions were applied for replacement therap y ,which then were followed by plasma derived VWF products containing fractions of FVIII (pdVWF/FVIII). A Swedish cohort including 37 patients with t ype 3 VWD under proph ylactic median treatment of 11 years (range 2 to 45 years) was retrospectivel y anal yzed.6,7The doses used for proph ylaxis,given once weekly for at least 45 weeks per y ear, were calculated based on 12 to 50 IU/ kgbody weight (BW)of FVIII clotting activity (FVIII:C ) which approxim ately corresponded to 24 -100 IU/kg von Willebrand factor: Ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:R Co)considering that mainly Haemate with a known VWF:RCo/FVIII:C ratio of about 2 was used. An escalation of doses from 1to 3dose levels was allowed depending on the frequency and severit y of bleeding episodes . For non-commercial use only"

Whereas the median value for bleeds per year was about 10 before prophy laxis this value could be reduced to less than 1 bleed per year during prophy laxis. The benefit of proph ylaxis for such indications was retrospectivel y also demonstrated in a cohort of Italian patients including t ype 3, 2A, 2M and typ e 1 patients. Prophy laxis was started after sever egastrointestinal or joint bleeding episodes and completely prevented bleeding episodes in 8 of these 11 patients and largely reduced the need of blood transfusions in the remaining 3. A regimen of 40 IU rV WF:RCo/kg was applied every other day or twice a week. A prospective study on prophy laxis, the PRO.WILL study , has been initiated in I taly.8 The results of a prospective study investigating the prophy laxis inchildren and young adults showed a significantly reduced bleeding frequency and bleeding score ( 3vs. 0.07; 3 vs. 0. p<0.001) compared to the pre- prophy laxis values. The median dose was 40(20-47) IU /kgVWF:RCo administered mainly twice weekly in 23 patients , 3 times a week in 7 patients and 4times a week in 2 children .9 The VWD Prophy laxis Network initiated the VWD Intern ational Proph ylaxis (VI P) trial to investigate the role of prophy laxis in patients with severe VWD including Ty pe 1, 2 , and3. The dose of the factor replaceme nt product was 50 IU /kgVWF:RCo. The frequency of the dose depended on the t ype of bleeding and could be increased from once weekl y to twice weekl y or3times per week. For the treatment of men orrhagia the dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo was given on the first day of menses for 2 cy cles. The f requency could be increased to D ay 1 and 2 for 2 cy cles or to Day 1, 2, and 3 of menses . The study contains both retrospective and prospective study components. Results from theretrospective study component were published, including 61subjects on prophy lactic regimen in the past 6 months prior to enrollment or subjects with a history of prophy laxis over at least 6 month .10Differences in annualized bleeding rates (ABR) within individuals (during prophylaxis – before proph ylaxis) were significant for those with primary indications of epistaxis (P = 0.0005), joint bleeding (P = 0.002) and GI bleeding (P = 0.001). The difference in the group whose primary indication for tre atment was abnormally heavy bleeding at menstruation (n = 4) was not significant (P = 0.25). The reduction of mucosal bleeding likel y not onl y dependen tson normal circulating levels of active VWF, but also on the presence of discrete concentrations of nor mal VWF inside the platelets and within endothelial matrices. The low subject number (n=4) and the treatment scheme for menorrhagia on Days 1, 2, and 3 of menses which might represent rather on-demand than prophy lactic treatment may also account for the ou tcome in this study .

Six subjects had ty pe 2A, and 5subjects had ty pe 3 VWD. Sixsubjects presented with epistaxis, 3 with GI bleeding, and 2with joint bleeding. Seven subjects had dose escalation above the first level. Among the 10 subjects with evaluable bleeding log data, the use of prophy laxis decreased the median ABR from 25 to 6.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] of the rate difference: -51.6 to - 1.7), and the median ABR was even lower (4.0; 95% CI : -57.5 to - 5.3) when the subjects reached their final dosing level. The authors concluded that this was the first prospective study to demonstrate that proph ylaxis with VWF concentrates is highl y effective in reducing mucosal and joint bleeding rates in clinicall y severe VWD. The results of the VI P study and previous investigations suggest that VWD patients with recurrent bleeding episodes and severe menorrhagia will benefit from a proph ylactic VWF replacement therapy . There is evidence that up to 40 % of patients with ty pe 3 VWD experience joint bleeding which can lead to hemophilic arthropath y. Other potential indications for prophy laxis include patients with ty pe 2A or 2B VWD with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, menorrhagia or frequent epistaxis .4Long-term prophy laxis for most patients with ty pe 3 VWD and in some patients with ty pe 1 or 2 VWD, depending on the pattern of bleeding, may be the treatment option of choice. Although the main experience with long -term prophy laxis is with secondary prophy laxis, primary proph ylaxis starting at young age is recommended to prevent art hropathy in patients with severe VWD.12 However, further studies are needed to develop evidence -based guidelines for prophy lactic treatment in VWD. 6.4Popu lation sto be Studied A total of approximately 22eligible , adult subjects with severe VWD (baseline VWF:RCo <20 IU/dL) are planned to be enrolled . Two cohorts of patients will be included : patients currently receiving on -demand VWF treatment (OD subjects) and patients currentl y on prophylactic treatment with pdVWF (pdVWF switch subjects) , and the aimis to have ≥8 subjects in each of the 2 cohorts, with a total of at least 5 type 3 VWD subjects followed for 12 months. Enrolled subjects (i .e., subjects who have signed the informed consent form) will be eligible to participate in the study if they meet all of the inclusion criteria (see Section 9.1) an d none of the exclusion criteria (see Section 9.2).

Potential risks and efficacy of rVWF (vonicog alfa):ADVATE (rFV III, octocog alfa) are summarized in the following sections. For additional information on nonclinical and clinical Phase 1 results refer to the rVWF (vonicog alfa) IB. 6.5.1 Findings from Nonclinical Studies 6.5.1.1 Primary Pharmacodynamics Efficacy of rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was shown in VWD animal models, which have also low endogenous FVIII levels. Time to occlusion and stable th rombus formation was asse ssed in the carotid occlusion model in VWD mice . The results demonstrated that rVWF (vonicog alfa) in combination with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) acted efficientl y in a dose -depend ent manner and had higher efficacy than rVWF (vonicog alfa) alone or plasma derived (pd) VWF. These results were confirme d in an additional study assessing blood loss and survival in a tail tip bleeding model in VW D mice . In a VWD dog , rVWF (vonicog alfa) stabilized canine FVIII in the circulation and significa ntly reduced the bleeding time. 6.5.1.2 Safety Pharmacology The anaph ylactoid and thrombogenic potential of the co -infusion of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) and rVWF (vonicog alfa) and the co- infused product’s effects on blood pressure, cardiac and respiratory function and parameters of coagulation activation were investigated in 4in vivo studies in different animal models. Safety pharma cology studies in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits ,and dogs revealed no risks for anaph ylactoid and thrombogenic potential of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in combination with rVWF (vonicog alfa) . All observations in safety pharmacology studies are considered to lie within the biological variability of animal models or occurred due to known species - specific anaph ylactoid effects of excipients.

Human rVWF (vonicog alfa) stabilized the endogenous FVIII in VWD mice, VWD pigs ,and VWD dogs. Furthermore, the h ypotheses that the area under the curve ( AUC )with rVWF alone and rVWF+ ADVATE is not inferior to the AUC with pdVWF (Haemate P) was tested and confirmed statistically in normal rats. ThePK characteristics of ADVATE (rFVII I, octocog alfa) were not affected by co- administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa) in cy nomolgus monkey s. The PK data in the FVIII knock out (k.o.) mice model are inconclusive and might not be relevant for the clinical situation. However, a stabilizing effect of VWF on FVIII could be shown in a double k.o. model in a dose depend ent manner. 6.5.1.4 Toxicology Single dose toxicity studies were conducted in C57BL/6J -mice, VWD mice, rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkeys. Rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkey s showed no signs of toxicity . Signs of microthrombosis, an exaggerated pharmacological effect, were observed in mice. Mice are not capable of sufficiently cleaving the rVWF (vonicog alfa) subunit as murine disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombos pondin ty pe 1 motif, number 13 (ADAMTS13 )does not decrease the ultra -large molecular weight multimers of rVWF (vonicog alfa) .13The observed s ymptoms of microthrombosis are interpreted as aspecies -specific exaggerated pharmacological effect. Studies evaluating the safet y of repeated administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) (daily over 14 days) were performed in a rodent (rat) and non -rodent (cynomolgus monkey ) species. Reversible signs of exaggerated pharmacological effects (regenerative anemia, thrombocy topenia, and treatment -related histopathologic changes in the heart, liver, and spleen) were observed in rats that were administered 1400 U VWF:RCo/kg /day + 1080 IU ADVATE/kg/day intravenousl y once daily for 14 day s. Also, these findings are interpreted as a species- specific exaggerated pharmacological effect due to the low susceptibility of human rVWF (vonicog alfa) to cleavage by rodent ADAMTS13 .13Notoxicologicall y relevant changes were evident for clinical observations, bod y weight, feed consumption, ophthalmology , urinal ysis, coagul ation, and serum chemistry parameters, platelet aggregation, and gross pathology. rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkey safter dail y intravenous ( i.v.)(bolus) administration of 100 U VWF:RCo/kg rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined with 77 IU/kg ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) over a period of 14 day s. No adverse effects could be detected in this species. For non-commercial use only"

Therefore, 100 UVWF:RCo/kg/day rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without 77 IU/kg ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was considered the no observed adverse effect level (NOAE L)inthis study , which was the highest dose tested. Anti- drug antibodies, however, were formed in both species and resulted in a significant reduction in drug exposure after 14 applications as compared to a single application. Thes e antibodies substantially reduced the sy stemic exposure to the test substance as compared to a single dose administration. No adverse effects due to antibody formation were observed in both species. rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was well tolerated locally and no genotoxic potential was evident after 2 in vitro and 1 in vivo genotoxicity study .A study on the influence of co- administration of VWF and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) onthe immunogenicity of ADVATE (rFVII I, octocog alfa) in 3different hemophilic mouse models (E17 hemophilic Balb/c mice, E17 hemophilic C57BL/6J mice , and E17 hemophilic human F8 transgenic mice) showed that rVWF (vonicog alfa) does not negativel y impact the immunogenicit y of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in any of the three dif ferent hemophilic mouse models. 6.5.2 Findings from Clinical Studies Details on study design, populations enrolled, and safet y and efficacy outcomes of the phase 1 studies arepresented in Section 6.5.2.1 andSection 6.5.2.2, the phase 3 study in Section 6.5.2.3, and the phase 3 surgery study in Section 6.5.2.4 .Information on a single subject with VWD in Study 071401 is presented in Section 6.5.2.5. 6.5.2.1 Study 070701 Phase 1 clinical study 070701 was a multicenter, controlled, randomized, single -blind , prospective 3 -step, dose escalation study to investigate safet y, tolerability ,and PK of rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined at a fixed ratio with ADVATE (VWF:RCo/FVIII:C of 1.3 ± 0.2:1) in adults with severe VWD .14Subjects were enrolled in sequential cohorts in a dose escalating manner: Cohort 1, 2, and 3 received a single intravenous infusion of rVWF: ADVATE at the following doses: 2 IU/kg VWF:RCo (Cohort 1), 7.5 IU/kg VWF:RCo (Cohort 2), and 20 IU/kg VWF:RCo (Cohort 3). Subjects in Cohort 4 received a single intravenous infusion of rVWF:ADVATE and pdVWF/ ADVATE at 50 I U/kg VWF:RCo in random order. For non-commercial use only"

The data generated in this phase 1 study suggest that rVWF: ADVATE up to the highest investigated dose of 50 IU /kgVWF:RCo is well tolerated and safe in adults with severe VWD. No thrombo genic risk or thrombotic thrombocy topenic purpura (TTP)-like syndrome was observed, and no neutralizing antibodies to VWF or FVIII were identified. There were no deaths or other serious adverse reactions, and no infusions were interrupted or stopped due to an AE. Overall, the reported AE profile was similar between the recombinant and plasma-derived concent rates. Secondar y endpoints were the PK assessment of VWF:RCo, von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag ) and multimeric composition of rVWF (vonicog alfa) as well as FVIII:C at standardized time points after single injections o f rVWF: ADVATE and pdVWF:FVIII. The median VWF:RCo terminal half-life (T 1/2)of rVWF (vonicog alfa) at the 50 IU/kg dose was 16 hours. T 1/2with pdVWF:FVIII at the same dose level appeared shorter at 12.58 hours, however, thelimits of the 90% CI were similar (11.73 to 17.7 hours vs. 11.87 to 18.03 hours). Themedian T1/2of VWF:RCo were shorter with the lower investigated doses: 7.13 hours and 13.23 hours with the 7.5 IU/kg and 20 IU/kg doses, although these data were derived from a much sm aller number of subjects. In consequence of the missing ADAMTS13 cleavage ,ultra-large molecular weight (ULMW) multimers are contained in the rVWF (vonicog alfa) final product. The immediate cleavage of these ultra -large multimers by ADAMTS13 upon release into the circulation could be demonstrated appl ying sodium dodecy l sulfate pol yacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE )/Immunoblot with poly clonal an ti-VWF antibodies to detect the resulting rVWF (vonicog alfa) subunit cleavage fragments. Overall the data generated in this phase 1 study suggest that rVWF (vonicog alfa): ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) is well tolerated and safe in adults with severe VWD. For non-commercial use only"

All subjects underwent 3 PK anal yses: the first after infusion with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) alone, the second after infusion with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) plus 10 IU/kg rVWF (vonicog alfa) and the third after infusion with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog al fa)plus 50 IU/kg rVWF (vonicog alfa) . The PK anal ysis was performed at intervals of approximately 8 to 14 day s. Before each infusion for PK assessment, there wasa wash -out period of at least 5 day s and the subjects were not actively bleeding. Primary outcome measures indicate that co - administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa) slightly sustain ADVATE activity with the highest observed ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) half-life of 13.74 h (CI 11.44to16.52) after co -infusion of 50 IU/ kg ADVATE plus 50 IU/kg rVWF :RCo . Thehighest improvement in ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) circulating half -life was observed in subjects with VWF:Ag levels below 100% which indicates an association between baseline VWF:Ag levels and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) half-life increase. No treatment related A Es or SAEs were reported . No subject withdrew due to an AE and there were no deaths. No binding antibodies to VWF, CHO ,and rFurin were detectable in the confirmatory assay and no signs of a h ypersensi ti vity to rVWF (vonicog alfa) or ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) antigen were observed. Laboratory values over time did not indicate an y potential safet y risk for hemophilia A patients treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa) and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in combination. In summary , the data i ndicate that rVWF (vonicog alfa) co-administered with ADVATE (rFV III, octocog alfa) up to the highest dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo is well tolerated and safe in hemophilia A pa tients.

The study consisted of 2parts (Part A and Part B). Part A consisted of PK assessments alone (Arm 2: PK50 onl y [without treatment of bleeding episodes]), or PK assessments (Arm 1: PK50 and Arm 3: PK80) plus on -demand trea tment period(s) of 6 months for bleeding episodes, or on -demand treatment for bleeding episodes only (Arm 4). Except for subjects in arm 2 who completed study after second PK assessment, subjects receiving treatment for PK assessments and/or bleeding epis odes in Part A were to be entered into Part B to continue on-demand treatment for bleeding episodes for 6additional months for a total of 12 months in the study . The primary outcome measure was the number of subjects with “treatment success” (extent of c ontrol of bleeding episodes), which was defined as a mean efficacy rating score of < 2.5 for a subject’s I P-treated bleeding episodes during the study . The rate of subjects with treatment success was 100% (Clopper -Pearson exact 90% CI: 84.7 to 100.0) for bleeds where the assessments were made prospectivel y and excluding GI bleeds. Sensitivity anal yses confirmed the r esults of the primary anal ysis. Crossover results at 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo showed that the PK profile for rVWF (vonicog alfa) VWF:RCo was independe nt of administration alone or with rFVIII (ADVATE, octocog alpha ) (T 1/2:19.4 hours for rVWF and 16.6 hours for rVWF:rFVIII; IR: 1.8 U/dL per IU/kg infused for both rVWF and rVWF:rFVIII; mean residence time ( MRT ): 26.7 hours for rVWF and 25.2 hours for rVW F:rFVIII). FVIII levels increased substantially with a median peak at 24 hours of 111.0 U/dL for rVWF:rFVIII and 86.0 U/dL after rVWF alone, indicating that rVWF (vonicog alfa) induces a sustained increase in endogenous FVIII activity . The rVWF (vonicog al fa)PK profile was comparable at 50 IU/kg and 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo, and repeated PK at 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo showed close agreement between pretreatment and end -of-study results.

Using 50 IU/kg for PK measurements, subjects in the 071001 study exhibiting a T1/2for rVWF of 14, 16 ,or 19 hours had rVWF plasm a concentrations at 72 hours after administration of 2.55, 4.01, and 6.49% above baseline, respectivel y, and plasma concentrations at 96 hours after administration of 0.78, 1.40 , and 2.71% above baseline, respectivel y. In this context it should be noted that subjects in the present stud y who have significant spontaneous bleeding while on twice weekl y prophy laxis will have their regimen increase dto 3 times per week based on clear criteria for different bleeding locations ( for details s ee Section 8.6.4.3.1). Subjects in the present study who are switching from prophy laxis with a pdVWF product will begin on rVWF (vonicog alfa) using their same weekl y total dose in IU/kg VWF:RCo used during their pdVWF proph ylaxis divided into twice weekly infusions (for details see Section 8.6.4.3 ). A total of 125 AEs occurred in 25/37 (67.7%) subjects (62/318 infusions [19.5%]) during or after infusion with IP. Of these, 116/125 were non -serious (all mild or moderate; none were severe ), and 9 SAEs were reported in 7 subjects. Of 125 total AEs, 38 were temporally associated with I P; 8 AEs were considered causally related to I P: 6 non- serious related AEs (tach ycardia, infusion site paraesthesia, electrocardiogram [ECG ] t-wave inversion, dysgeusia, generalized pruriti s, and hot flush) occurred in 4 subjects, and 2 related SAEs (chest discomfort and incr eased heart rate) occurred in 1subject. No dea ths occurred during this study . None of the subjects developed anti- VWF or anti -FVIII neutra lizing antibodies and no binding antibodies to VWF or rFurin, or antibodies against CHO protein or anti -Murine IgG were observed. No clinical or subclinical signs or symptoms of a thrombogenic event were observed in this study . Following an initial increase in ultralarge VWF multimers after administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa), a notable decrease in the proportion of large VWF multimers occurred between 12 and 24 hours post infusion, due to degradation by the endogenous ADAMTS13 followed by a continued dec line until the end of the 96- hour follow -up period. Overall, the data support the safe and effective use of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without rFVIII (ADVATE, octocog alpha ) in the treatment of bleeds in patients with VWD.

Eleven subjects underwent a PK assessment by infusion of 50 ± 5 IU/kg rVWF:RCo at an infusion rate of up to 4 mL/min. 12 to 24 hours before surgery , subjects received a dose of 40 to 60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo. Within 3 hours prior to surgery , the subject’s FVIII:C levels were assessed with a target of 30 IU/dL for minor and oral surgeries and 60 IU/dL for major surgeries. Within 1 hour prior to surgery, subjects received a dose of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) (depending on the target FVIII:C levels at the 3 hour assessment). VWF and FVIII IR and T 1/2for each subject, when known, were used to guide the initial dose and subsequent doses. The primary outcome measure was the overall assessment of hemostatic efficacy assessed b y the investigator (hemophilia physician) 24 hours after last perioperative IP infusion or at completion of day 14 visit, whichever occurred earlier, and was summarized by the percentage of subjects in each efficacy category (“excellent”, “good”, “moderate” and “none”). Point estimate and corresponding 90% two -sided exact CI was calculated for the rate of subjects with an overall assessment of hemostatic efficacy . All 15subjects treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa) (with or without ADVATE) for major (10), minor (4), and oral (1) elective surgical procedures had overall hemostatic efficacy ratings of “excellent” or “good”. M ost (73.3%) subjects had “excellent” overall hemosta tic efficacy ratings; of these, 7 underwent major surgery and 4 underwent minor surgery . The remaining 26.7% subjects had “good” overall hemostatic efficacy ratings: 3underwent major surgery and 1 underwent oral surgery . All 8 subjects with VWD Type 3, the subty pe classified as absolute VWF deficiency , had overall hemostatic efficacy ratings of “excellent” (87.5%) or “good” (12.5%). Intraoperative hemostatic efficacy ratings were also rated as “excellent” or “good” for all 15treated subjects. Most (86.7%) subjects had “excellent” intraoperative hemostatic efficacy ratings; of these, 8 underwent major surgery , 4 underwent minor surgery , and 1underwent oral surgery. Two (13.3%) subjects who underwent major surgery had “good” intraoperative hemostatic effica cy ratings. I ntraoperative hemostatic efficacy wasrated as “excellent” or “good” for all subjects with VWD Ty pe 3: “excellent” for 7(87.5%) subjects and “good” for 1 (12.5%) subject.

The median daily postoperative weight -adjusted dose of rVWF (vonicog alfa) (with or without ADVATE )was 23.5 IU/kg on postoperative Day 1 (n=3) and 25.5 IU/kg on postoperative Day 14 (n=2) .Insubjects treated with rVWF:ADVATE, the daily postoperative weight -adjusted dose was 16.9 IU/kg rVWF and 7.6 IU/kg ADVATE on postoperative Day 1 (n=1) and decreased to 50.8 IU/kg rVWF and 7.6 IU/kg ADVATE on postoperative Day 7 (n=1). For subjects treated w ith rVWF alone, the median weight -adjusted dose (Q1, Q3) of rVWF was 35.4 IU/kg on postoperative Day 1 (n=2) and decreased to 23.7 IU/kg on postoperative Day 7 (n=4) and 25.5 IU/kg on postoperative Day 14(n=2). A total of 11 subjects were evaluated for PK in the study . As expected, postinfusion increases in concentrations of VWF:RCo, VWF:Ac, VWF:Ag, and VWF collagen binding (VWF:CB ) were observed. Mean values for VWF:RCo were as follows: AUC0 -∞/dose was 37.50 hours*IU/dL per IU/kg infused; AUC0- 72h/dose w as 34.08 hours*IU/dL per IU/kg infused; T1/2 was 17.83 hours; MRT was 24.32 hours; CLwas 0.03117 dL/hour/kg; and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss)was 0.6837 dL/kg. Median values for VWF:RCo were as follows: AUC0- ∞/dose was 32.94 hours*IU/dL per IU/kg infused; AUC0- 72h/dose was 31.70 hours*IU/ dL per IU/kg infused; T1/2 was 14.62 hours; MRT was 21.80 hours; CL was 0.03036 dL/hour/kg; and Vss was 0.7078 dL /kg. The VWF:RCo activity was consistent with that previously observed in clinical studies 071001 and 070701. rVWF (vonicog alfa) was safe and well tolerated in adults with severe VWD undergoing major, minor, and oral elective surgical procedures. Of the 12 total treatment -emergent AEs ( TEAEs )that occurred during the study , 2 deep vein thrombos is events (1 non - serious and 1 serious, as a part of one case) reported in one subject, who underwent total hip replacement surgery and who had concurrent condition of obesity , wasassessed by the sponsor as possibly causally -related to study treatment. None of the TEAEs were either a severe allergic or hy persensitivity reaction or developed due to a severe allergic reaction. One subject with VWD Ty pe 3 who had an intraoperative transfusion of packed red blood cells during total knee replacement surgery tested positive for binding antibodies to VWF on postoperative Day 7 through study completion.

For the initial rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusion, the subject received a test dose of 5% of thetotal dose of 60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo at an infusion rate of 1 mL/min. After a 10 to 15-minute observation period, no adverse sy mptoms or signs were noted and the subject received the remaining 95% of the total dose. The subject was monitored for an y signs of an allergic reaction, and none were noted. Treatment with rVWF (vonicog alfa) every 12to 24 hours was to continue at the discretion of the investigator based on VWF levels and clinical s ymptomatology . The subject had an excellent response and recovery , which allowed for daily dosing of rVWF (vonicog alfa) and, within 24 hours, the s ubject’s bleeding had stopped. Daily dosing of rVWF (vonicog alfa) was maintained and the subject received his last dose on . The subject also received rVWF (vonicog alfa) for 7 days for prophy laxis for surgery (surgical resection of a left- kidney mass). The subject experienced no hemorrhagic complications and no AEs that were considered related to the use of rVWF (vonicog alfa). 6.6Evaluation of Anticipated Risks and Benefits of the Investigational Product(s) to Human Subjects Current treatment of VWD patients relies on desmopressin and VWF products manufactured from pooled human plasma. Human VWF produced b y recombinant technology could offer a new perspective in treatment of VWD. The benefit for the individual subject is anticipated to be significant during this clinical stud y. He/she may benefit from a product that minimizes excessive FVIII administration and thus allowing individualized dosing of VWF at optimal levels . Vari ations in VWF multimeric composition may lead to variability with respect to treating or preventing bleeds in VWD subjects, especially mucosal bleeds which are especiall y problematic. rVWF (vonicog alfa) product manufactured by Baxalta consistently contain s ULMW VWF multimers due to the fact that the product has not been exposed to ADAMTS13.

By using a recombinant product, the risk of transmission of adventitious agents and other blood -borne pathogens associated with the use of products of human or animal origin has been eliminated . At this stage of product development, the key societal benefit is a better understanding of advanced treatment options for VWD and enhanced product availability . These benefits outweigh the following identified or potential risks of rVWF (vonicog alfa): a llergic- type hypersensitivity reactions as with an y intravenous protein product the occurrence of thrombo embolic events the development of neutralizing antibodies to VWF Refer to the IB for further details on benefits and risks of the I P. 6.7Compliance Statement This study will be conducted in accordance with this protocol, the I nternational Council forHarmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 (ICH GCP, April 1996 , with Addendum E6(R2) dated Nov 2016 EMA/CHMP/ICH/ 135/1995 ), Title 21 of the U S Code of Federal Regulations (US CFR), the EUDirective s2001/20/EC and 2005/28/EC , the Declaration of Helsinki and applicable national and local regulatory requirements.

Dose and frequency adjustment sshould be agreed with the sponsor in advance unless it constitutes an urgent safet y measure . The rationale for dosing adjustments need sto be documented in the subject’s medical record . For both OD and switch patients, dose escalations (not exceeding the upper dose limit of 80 IU/kg rVWF:RCo) and increase of dose frequency will only be allowed in case of insufficient therapeutic response with breakthrough bleeding episodes. The c riteria for dose and /orfrequency escalation are specific to each bleeding indication but, overall, involve 1 significant breakthrough bleeding episode despite the subject bein g compliant with scheduled proph ylaxistreatment . For switch patients who require a dose escalation due to a breakthrough bleed, the frequency should be kept the same but the dose (IUVWF:RCo per infusion) should be increased up to 80 I U VWF:RCo. Following that, increases in frequency may be considered upon consultation with the Sponsor. For on demand subjects who require a dose escalation, at the discretion of the PI upon consultation with the Sponsor, the frequency may be kept the same but the dose (IUVWF:RCo per infusion) should be increased up to 80 I U VWF:RCo. I f this proves to be insufficient, then the dosing frequ ency may be increased in these subjects. Table 2 presents the criteria for dosing escalation per each bleeding indication taken 50 ± 10 I U VWF:RCo/kg twice weekly dose as an example of subject’s assigned starting dose. The criteria are applicable for both OD and switch subjects who were initially assigned to twice weekly dosing .Subjects entering the study will begin proph ylaxis treatment according to Schedule A ( Table 1)and will remain at this dose and frequency until meeting the criteria for escalation to the next higher schedule : for example, from 2 infusions of 50 ± 10 IUVWF:RCo/kg/week to 3 infusions of 50 ± 10 IU VWF:RCo/kg/week (Schedule B) to achieve an adequate therapeutic response .If a subject started with a weekly dose (possible for switch subjects), similar criteria would apply except that the subject will be excalated to twice weekl y dosing if frequency change is necessary .

If a subject experiences a bleed while receiving rVWF (vonicog alfa) three times per week, the investigator should treat the bleed with rVWF (vonicog alfa) at doses up to 80IU VWF:RCo/kg at a frequency determined by the investigator until the bleed resolves. Upon resolution of the bleeding event, the subject will return to their assigned prophy laxis regimen. Itis essential for the success of this study that the subjects adhere to treatment regimens. Therefore, procedures for monitoring subject’s compliance are implemented (see Section 10.7) . If 1infusion of IP is missed, the subject may administer the I P as soon as possible .The subject should adhere to the irtreatment scheme ensuring a minimum interval of 12 hours between this and the previous I P infusion. For example ,a subject routinel y infuses I P on Monday and Thursday ,he/she misses the Monday time point and therefore may infuse the IP on the next day (Tuesday )and thereafter proceed with infusing the IP on Thursday (considering a minimum 12 hours between the infusions )and return to the initial schedule. If more than 30% of infusions of IP aremisse dwithin the visit interval of 3 months the subject will be discontinued from the stud y (see Section 9.4). 8.6.4.3.2 General Instructions for Home Treatment forProphylaxis At the discretion of the investigator, a subject may be considered suitable for home treatment only after the subject has received at least 1infusion of I Pin the clinic ,either during planned proph ylactic IP exposure or during the treatment of bleeding episodes, and meets the following additional criteria : 1.Fully understands the concept of a clinical study and related documentation (documented training of at least 30 minutes), 2.Has a history of previous experience with home treatment including self-administration and treatment with VWF containing concentrates, 3.Has adequate time for initial training of the stud y drug preparation (prepar ation, mixing and infusion of the IP(s) (documented tr aining of at least 30 minutes) .

In the event a healthcare professional is required to administer IP, he/she must be trained and qualified by the investigator on the above procedures prior to the decision for home treatment. A Subject Guideline detailing all instructions and information l isted above will be provided to each subject. 8.6.4.4 Treatment of Bleeding Episodes 8.6.4.4.1 General Instructions for Home Treatment of Bleeding Episodes If a subject experiences a bleeding episode, he/she should contact the study site immediately and the site investigato r should provide instructions on the treatment regimen. If the subject initiates the treatment at home, he/she should at least follow up with the study site if avisit is needed as per the standard of care at the center . In the event a healthcare professional is required to administer treatment at the subject’s home, he/she must be trained and qualified b y the site investigator on the above procedures prior to the decision for home treatment. Once a subject has received 1infusion of rVWF (vonicog alfa) in the clinic (either during planned IP exposure or during the t reatment o f a bleeding episode) and meets the criteria for home treatment, the treatment of bleeding episodes with I P can be conducted at home (see Section 8.6.4.3.2). If a subject is not qualified for home treatment, rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusions must be administered at the study site. If a subject experiences a bleeding episode that requires treatment between the screening and the proph ylaxis initiation visit , the subject will be treated with I P (rVWF with or without ADVATE ). Treatment with I P must occur at the study site unless the subject has previously qualified for home treatment with rVWF (vonicog alfa) . If rVWF (vonicog alfa) treatment is not feasible, the subject may use his/her standard of care, such as commercial pdVWF/FVIII products. In any case a washout period of at least 5 day s is requir ed prior to rVWF (vonicog alfa) PK infusion at the initial PK assessment visit for on-demand subjects . If a subject experiences a bleeding episode requiring treatment during the PK assessment, rVWF (vonicog alfa) should be used to treat the bleed . Blood draws for PK assessment will be stopped and the PK assessments will be repeated once the bleed has resolved and the subject is free of any symptoms related with the bleeding episode . Dose and frequency of rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusions or any other replacement therapy to stop the bleed should be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ), and the reason for the use of any non -IP product or therapy should be documented .

It is the sponsor’s opinion that, in many cases, treatment with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) may not be necessary, since rVWF (vonicog alfa) proph ylaxis will serve to increase endogenous FVIII levels. However, if endogenous FVIII is below 30-40 % or is unknown and cannot be estimated from the subject’s PK study , an infusion of rVWF: ADVATE at anrVWF: ADVATE ratio of 1.3:1± 0.2 should be administered initially . Subsequent infusion sshould be with rVWF:RCo 40 to 60 I U/kg with or , in many cases, without 30 to 45 I U/kg ADVATE (only to be administered if plasma FVIII levels fall below 30 IU/L during the treatment period) . Dosing may be adjusted downward or upward up to 80 IU/kg rVWF at the treating ph ysician’s discretion based upon the subject’s prior history , PK and other factors. If FVIII levels are not available, dosing is at the discretion of the investigator b ased upon the individual subject’s PK data. Using ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in addition to rVWF (vonicog alfa) in subsequent doses carries the risk of an excessive rise in FVIII:C. Therefore, reduced doses of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) and/or prolon gation of the dose interval should be considered. The following is general guidance and the sponsor’s suggestion for treatment of breakthrough bleeds, however each PI will determine the treatment based on the local acceptable practice how to monitor and adjust treatment for a bleeding episode. An effort should be made to discuss with the sponsor (or sponsor’s delegate) the treatment strategy . In general the aim of the initial dose should be full replacement of VWF with VWF:RCo levels of >0 .6IU/ml (60%) a nd FVIII:C of > 0.4 IU/mL (40%). In major bleeding episodes ,subsequent doses should keep the trough level of VWF:RCo >50% for 3 day s and then as deemed necessary by the investigator for subsequent days. In moderate bleeding episodes ,the dose and trough le vel may be reduced to >30% for as long as deemed necessary by the investigator. Treatment for minor bleeding episodes will generall y consist of onl y 1 or 2 doses of rVWF (vonicog alfa) IP. If the VWF:RCo level is above 150%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 12 hours; if the VWF:RCo level is above 200%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 24 hours. In either case, a lower subsequent dose (e.g., 20 IU/kg VWF:RCo) may be appropriate. Dosing recommendations are listed in Table 3. For non-commercial use only"

In the phase 1 study 070701, 1 .0IU/kg VWF:RCo raised the circulating level of VWF:RCo by 0.017 IU/mL (1.7 %). In the same study , the o bserved mean half -life for rVWF (vonicog alfa) was 19.3 hours, with a st andard deviation of 10.9 hours.

A diagnosis of menorrhagia will be defined by a prospectively completed Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) score >185 and normal cervical cytology or requiring use of a VWF -containing concentrate for treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding for at least one menstrual cycle during the prior year. Variances of up to 10% in dosing are permissible during treatment of bleeding episodes, but rounding to the nearest vial size should be avoided. Subjects with non- neutralizing binding anti -VWF antibodies should initially be treated with a dose known to be efficacious based on the subject’s medical treatment history which may differ from the recom mendations provided in Table 3. Subjects should be monitored for lack of efficacy as well as for FVIII (mandatory ), VWF:RCo (m andatory ), and VWF:Ag (o ptional where testing is not available) levels after 3 to 6hours. Re -dosing with rVWF (vonicog alfa) in combination with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) using the same (initial) dose and adaptation of the dosing frequency should be considered until cessation of the bleed, if the FVIII and/or VWF:RCo levels drop below 30% -50% depending on bleeding severity .

Subjects who at time of screening have an alread y scheduled surgical intervention are not eligible for participation in the study . 8.6.4.5.1 Majo r, Minor and Oral Surgery Definition The following definitions and criteria are used to serve as a guidance for major, minor and oral surgery . Major surgeries generally refer to major orthopedic surgery (e.g., joint replacement, arthroscopic or open s ynovectomy , arthrodesis, hardware removals like plates or intramedullary nails, etc.), major abdominal surgery (e.g. open or laparoscopic hernioplasty , cholecy stectomy , colon or small bowel resection, etc.), major gy necological surgery (e.g. open or laparoscopi c myomectom y, hysterectomy, removal of endometriosis, poly ps, cysts, adhesioly sis, etc.), major head and neck surgery (e.g.: tonsillectomy , adenoidectomy , rhinoplast y, lymphadenectomy, th yroidectomy , parotidectom y. etc.), an y intracranial , cardiovascular or spinal surgery and any other surgery which has a significant risk of large volume blood loss or blood loss into a confined anatomical space. Extraction of impacted third molars is generall y also considered major surgery due to the expected difficulty ofsurgery and the expected blood loss. Minor surgeries generally refer to interventions such as placement of intravenous access devices, removal of small skin lesions, arthroscopy, gastroscop y, colonoscopy or conisation. Oral surgeries comprise extractions of fewer than three teeth, if the teeth are non- molars and have no bon y involvement.

As a general guidance a priming dose of 40 -60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo will be administered .If not assessed prior to the preoperative priming dose, a IR recovery may be calculated for subjects undergoing minor and oral surgery . 8.6.4.5.3 Preoperative Loading Dose An rVWF (vonicog alfa) loading dose should be administed within 3 hours before surgery . VWF and FVIII levels should be assessed within 3 hours prior to surgery initiation and results must be available prior to administering the lo ading dose. If FVIII levels prior to loading dose administration are not at least 30 IU/dL (minor, oral surgery ), or 60 IU/dL (major surgery ) ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) will be administered in addition to rVWF (vonicog alfa) in order to raise FVIII:C le vels to recommended levels. The preoperative loading dose will be calculated as the difference in the target peak and baseline plasma VWF:RCo levels divided by the IR (ΔVWF:RCo x BW (kg) /IR). The PK results will be provided prior to the planned surgery . If the IR is not available, assume an IR of 1.7 IU/dL per IU/kg and calculate the initial dose as follows: (100 –baseline plasma VWF:RCo) x BW (kg) / 1.7. For minor and oral surgery , the IR from the Preoperative Priming Dose visit will be used to guide dos ing and the target peak is 50-60 IU/dL VWF:RCo and 40 -50 IU/dL FVIII. For major surgery , the target peak is 100IU/dL VWF:RCo and 80- 100 IU/dL FVIII. The surgery may only start after normalization of the activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT). 8.6.4.5.4 Intra- and Postoperative (maintenance) Dosing After the preoperative loading dose(s), subjects who have not achieved the desired postinfusion recovery will continue to receive rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) as a bolus infusion, depending on VWF and FVIII levels. The peri -and post -operative substitution regimen will be individualized according to the PK results, intensity and duration of the hemostatic challenge, and the institution’s standard of care.

Subjects undergoing oral surgery will be infused with rVWF (vonicog alfa) at least once within the f irst 8- 12 hours, targeting ≥30 IU/dL (rVWF and FVIII). Subjects undergoing major surgery will be infused with rVWF (vonicog alfa) every 12-24 hours for at least the first 72 hours post -surgery , targeting a VWF:RCo and FVIII:C trough plasma leve l >50 IU/dL, followed by further treatment post -72 hours for as long as deemed necessary by the Investigator, targeting a VWF:RCo and FVIII:C trough plasma level of ≥30 IU/dL . Dose modifications based on pre - infusion VWF/FVIII levels will be pe rformed as needed. For subsequent infusions post surgery , in case pre -infusion levels are not available prior to the consecutive infusion in a timely manner, pre -infusion levels from the previous dose may be used by the investigator for dosing guidance. Peak plasma level guidance is matching to Section 8.6.4.4.2 A schedule of all perioperative visit assessments and laboratory sampling can be found in Supplement t ables in Section 20.2.1 and Section 20.3.1. 8.6.4.6 Thrombosis Prophylaxis Thromboembolic events have been reported in patients who have VWD, especiall y in the setting of known risk factors for thrombosis including low ADAMTS13 levels . Therefore, subjects who are at risk for developing thromboembolic events should be monitored for earl y signs of thrombosis, and prophylaxis measures against thromboembolism should be instituted according to current recommendations and standard of care . For all subjects who are VWD patients and are receiving VWF concentrate, attention should be given to avoid exceeding maximal recommended plasma activity level s of VWF :RCo (250 IU/dL) and FVIII (250 IU/dL).

For example, the third subject who signed an informed consent form at stud y site 02 will be identified as Subject 071301- 020003. All study documents (e . g., CRFs, cli nical documentation, sample containers, drug accountability logs, etc.) will be identified with the SI C. Additionally , a uniquely coded SI C(s) is permitted as long as it does not contain a combination of information that allows identification of a subject (e. g., collection of a subject’s initials and birth date would not be permitted), in compliance with laws governing data privacy . 10.3 Screening and Study Visits The study site is responsible for maintaining a screening log that includes all subjects who provid ed informed consent . The log also will serve to document the reason for screening failure. All screening data will be collected and reported in CRF, regardless of screening outcome. If a subje ct is re -screened, the End of Study CRF should be completed, and a new ICF, new SIC and new CRF are required for that subject. The overall study design is illustrated in the Figure 1. Details on the procedures to be performed at each stud y visit, including screening, are provided in Supplement 20.2 “Schedule of Stud y Procedures and Assessments ”and Supplement 20.3 “Clinical Laboratory Assessments ” . 10.3.1 Scre ening V isit Written informed consent must be obtained from each subject before an y study related procedures are performed. To initiate screening procedures, at least 72 hours must have elapsed since the last VWF administration for on -demand subjects and the subject must not be actively bleeding at the time of screening. For switch subjects, the usual interval between their pdVWF proph y infusions must have elapsed since the last VWF administration and the subject must not be actively bleeding at the time of screening. Multimer analysis and VWD gene mutation analy sis should be performed atscreening if n ot available in the subject’s medical history . For non-commercial use only"

I f the IP is not infused within 42days,allscreening assessments except blood group, human leukocy te antigen ( HLA), genetics , multimeric pattern and ,must be repeated to reconfirm eligibility . Refer to Supplement 20.2 and Supplement 20.3. Upon completion of screening procedures, subject eligibility will be confirmed by the sponsor on a subject eligibility form before additional study procedures are undertaken. The subject will maintain a diary that will include infusion logs (see Section 10.5). The allocation of IP will be initiated after the subject has qualified for home treatment (see Section 8.6.4.3.2 ). In the event of a subject experienc inga bleeding episode that requires treatment between the screening visit and the subsequent visit (i.e. initial PK assessment visit for on -demand subjects or proph ylaxis initiation visit for switch subjects ), the subject willbe treated with rVWF (vonicog a lfa). If rVWF (vonicog alfa) is not available for any reason , e.g., subject not yet trained on IP administration, study site visit for I P administration not feasible, etc., the subject may use h is/her standard of care, such as commercial pdVWF/FVIII produc ts, and the reason for the use of non -IP products should be clearl y documented. 10.3.2 Baseline Vi sit – Initial PKAssessment (On-demand Subject sOnly) After screening and confirmation of eligibility on-demand subjects will undergo a n initial PK assessmen t. Subjects will receive a dose of 50 ± 5 IU/kg rVWF:RCo to determine VWF and FVIII levels. Blood samples will be drawn within 30 minutes pre-infusion, and at 11 time points post -infusion ( 15 ± 5 minutes, 30 5 minutes, 60 5 minutes, 3 ± 0.5 hours, 6 0.5hours, 12  0.5hours, 24 0.5hours, 30 ± 2 hours, 48 2 hours, 722hours and 96 ± 2 hours). See Section 20.2 and Section 20.3. IP infusion vials from the same lot number should be used for all PK-assessments per subject . Samples for measurement of FVIII and VWF activit y taken through to 6hours post -infusion will be obtained from an extremity different from th at used for the infusion of IP. Where needed, the phlebotomy site will be kept patent via an infusion of normal saline. In this event, at least 5 mL of blood will be collected and discarded before collection of the next test sample into a fresh s yringe. If the subject has a central venous catheter, the central line should be used to administer the infusion and a peripheral venipuncture should be use d to collect the blood samples.

The following details on bleeding episodes will be recorded by the subject in the electronic diary (for home treatment), the subject’s healthcare provider in the site’s source documents (for treatments away from the primary investigative site), or by authorized, qualified personnel at the participating site in the subject’s medical records (for hospital -based treatment): Location of bleed; i.e., joint, menorrhagia, epistaxis, gastrointestinal, soft tissue, muscle, body cavit y, intracranial, etc. Type of bleed; i.e., spontaneous, traumatic, unknown Severity of bleed; i.e.,minor, moderate, and major (see Table 3) Date and time of onset of bleed Date and time of each infusion of rVWF (voni cog alfa) or rVWF (vonicog alfa)- ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) used to treat a bleeding episode Date and time of resolution of the bleeding episode Study site personnel are qualified after they have under gone training during the qualification of the site. All ty pes of bleeds, including tra umatic bleeds, will be recorded. Bleeding episodes should be organized by where they occur in addition to whether they occurred spontaneously or due to a traumatic event. Bleeds occurring at the same anatomical location (e.g., right knee) with the same etiology (i.e., spontaneous v ersus injury ) within 24 hours after onset of the first bleed will be considered a single bleed. Bleeding occurring at multiple locations related to the same injury (e.g., knee and ankle bleeds following a fall) will be counted as a single bleeding episode. All efforts should be made to use rVWF (vonicog alfa) for treatment of bleeding episodes. If needed , the use of a VWF concentrate other than IPfor the treatment of bleeding episodes will not disqualify the subject from further participation in the study . For non-commercial use only"

Additional blood will be drawn for Anti -VWF IgE antibody testing (Section 12.9.13). 12.7 Vital Signs Vital signs will be assessed pre-and post -infusion at each visit, if not stated otherwise:  Height (cm) (Screening only ) and weight (kg) (pre-infusion only )  Blood pressure: Sy stolic/diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) baseline measurements will be measured after a 10 -minute rest in the supine/semi - recumbent position.  Pulse rate: Pulse rate (beats/min) will be measured at the distal radial arteries under the same conditions as above.  Respiratory rate: Respiratory rate (breaths/min) will be measured over a period of 1minute under the same conditions as above.  Temperature: Bod y temperature (°C or °F) may be determined by oral, rectal, axillary , or t ympanic measurement at the discretion of the investigator. However, the same method should be used for all measurements in 1 subject. Vital signs (pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure) should be recorded within 30min before and after IP administration. Th e assessment of vital signs per planned study visit is outlined in Supplement 20.2. Vital sign values are to be recorded on the ph ysical examination eCRF. For each vital sign value, the investigator will determine whether the value is considered an AE(see definition in Sec tion12.1). If assessed as an AE, the medical diagnosis (preferabl y), symptom, or sign, will be recorded on the AE eCRF. For non-commercial use only"

In general all laboratory tests will be performed at central laboratories , except the pregnancy and blood group test which will be performed at the local laboratory .In addition, rel evant critical safet y laboratory tests for complete blood count (CBC ), serum chemistry and/or coagulation parameters such as VWF and FVIII activity may also be performed in the local laboratory to ensure that results will be available immediately to the investigator. In principle, results from the central laboratory will be used for data analysis purposes. The assay s performed in the central laboratories are specified in the Laboratory Manual. The i nvestigator will supply the sponsor with a list of the nor mal ranges and units of measurement for the laboratory variables to be determined at the site. Laboratory values such as antibodies to other proteins are not required immediately and will be assessed later during the course of the study.

Hematology and clinical chemistry assessments will be performed on Ethy lenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA )-anticoagulated whole blood and serum, respectivel y, at the central laboratory . 12.9.3 Immunology 12.9.3.1 Antibodies to VWF and FVIII All subjects will be tested for binding and neutralizing antibodies to VWF and FVIII at screeni ng, at initial PK assessment, at each of the scheduled follow -up visits and at the study completion visit. Testing will be done prior to IP infusion and with at least a 72hour wash out period since the last I P infusion. If there is any suspicion of inhibitor development (e.g. excessive bleeding) binding and neutralizing antibodies to VWF and FVIII may be tested at the discretion of the investigator. 12.9.3.2 Neutralizing and Total Binding Anti -VWF Antibodies The assay s to establish the presence of neutralizing and total binding anti -VWF antibodies have been established in the absence of international standards and with only limited numbers of positive controls. Therefore, caution is advised in interpreting positive results. I n particular, any clinical association, changes in the natural history of the disease, effect of therapy, etc. needs to be taken into account for final judgment. Thesponsor’s Medical Director should be consulted for additional advice. As part of the AE follow -up, an y sample testing positive needs to be confirmed after 2 -4 weeks for central lab oratory testing. Only confirmed neutralizing anti -VWF antibodies are considered inhibitors (see Section 12.9.3.4) . These subjects need to be closely monitored and therap y adjusted accordingl y.

For this assay (ELI SA), recombinant human VWF will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then in cubated with dilutions of the positive control, the negative control or test sample. Antibodies against human VWF that are present in the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -coupled goat anti- human antibody (secondary antibody ). The positive control for this assay will be a human monoclonal antibody specific for human VWF spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human plasma. Plasma samples are analy zed for binding antibodies against the specific antigen in two steps. First, the sample is screened for antibodies and the titer of binding antibodies is determined. Second, the specificit y of positive antibody results is confirmed.16 Inbrief, all samples are serially diluted (initial dilution 1:20 and further diluted 1:2). Thetiter endpoint, defined as the highest dilution that still gives a positive signal above cut off level, is determined in two independent duplicates. The cut off level is established based on background signal level of healthy plasma donors (n=160) and set to include 5% false positives to be as sensitive as possible (95% percentile). The ELISA assay is validated allowing a nassay variability of ± 1 titer step. Therefore, differences ≤ 2 titers steps may be due to variability of the ELISA assay. Specificity has to be confirmed in a competition assay when a sample has a titer of 1:80 or higher in the scr eening assay . Based on the validation criteria samples tested in the screening assay at 1:20 or 1:40 cannot be confirmed in the competition assay . A positive screening value is confirmed if the difference between the titers determined for the subject sampl e (re- screen) and for the subject sample with pre -incubation (confirmation sample) is > 2 titer steps. Antibody titers of subject samples will only be reported as positive, if the results of the screening and confirmatory anal ysis fulfill these acceptance criteria. The titer to be reported is alway s the one determined in the original screening procedure (independent of the result of the re -screening in the confirmation procedure). A more detailed test procedure will be supplied upon request or pro -actively if a sample tests positive. A treatment related increase of the binding anti -VWF antibodies is expected, if the titer increases by more than 2 titration steps. These subjects need to be closely monitored and therapy adjusted accordingly . For non-commercial use only"

Neutralizing antibodies to VWF:RCo, VWF:CB and VWF:FVIIIB activities will be measured b y assay s based on the Bethesda assay established for quantitative analy sis of FVIII inhibitors (Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay ).17The amount of inhibitor is expressed as BU per mL. One BU is thereb y defined as the amount of inhibitor that decreases the measured activity in the assay s to 50% of that of the negative control samples. The assay s were validated using human plasma samples from two type 3 VWD patients with low (1-2 BU/mL) and high (~10 BU/mL) titer inhibitors and plasma samples from non-human primates immunized with human rVWF (vonicog alfa) (>100 BU/mL) . If a subject has a measurable baseline level of VWF activity in the respective assay , it is taken into account in the calculation of the residual activ ity. However, if baseline levels are too high (>15% VWF:RCo), inhibitors may not be reliabl y detected. To exclude false positive results, the detection limit for anti -VWF inhibitors was set to 1BU/ml for all 3 assay s. The rationale for this cut -off value is the relativel y high CIof the underl ying assay s, making determinations at the end of the evaluation range of the Bethesda reference curve uncertain.18A more detailed test procedure may be requested to further characterize the anti- VWF inhibitors, if detected. Only confirmed positive anti-VWF inhibitor test r esult will be reported and will be considered as a medically significant SAE. 12.9.3.5 Binding Antibodies to FVIII Binding antibodies against FVIII will be anal yzed using a proprietary enzyme immunoassay . The testing strategy will be as described for binding anti -VWF antibodies. Antibody -containi ng samples will be identified in a screening assay followed by a confirmatory assay to exclude false positive results. 12.9.3.6 Neutralizing Antibodies (I nhibitors) to FVIII Neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to FVIII will be assessed b y the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay in a central laboratory . To verify a FVIII inhibitor, additional testing (such as tests for L upus anticoagulants) may be initiated. Positive F VIII inhibitor tests will be defined as ≥ 0.4 BU b y the Nijmegen -modified Bethesda assay that is confirmed b y a second test performed on an independent sample obtained 2- 4 weeks following the first test. Only confirmed positive FVIII inhibitor test result will be reported. For non-commercial use only"

The testing strategy will be as described for binding anti -VWF antibodies. Antibody -containing samples will be identified in a screening assay followed by a confirmatory assay to exclude false positive results. 12.9.4.1 Anti -CHO Protein Total Ig antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM) against CHO protein will be anal yzed.For this assay (ELISA), CHO protein derived from cultures of untransfected cells and propagated under the identical cell culture conditions used for ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) production will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then incubated with dilut ions of the positive control, negative control or test sample. Antibodies against CHO protein that are present in the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a HRP -coupled goat anti-human antibody (secondary antibody ). The positive con trol for this assay will be a polyclonal goat anti -CHO protein antibody spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human plasma. 12.9.4.2 Anti -Murine IgG A commerciall y available ELI SA (Medac, Hamburg, Germany ) will be us ed to detect and to quantify IgG antibodies originating from human plasma that are directed against mouse -IgG (HAMA: human anti -mouse antibodies). M icrotiter plates coated with mouse IgG will be incubated with dilutions of the standard, the positive contr ol, the negative control or the test sample. Antibodies against mouse IgG that are present in thesamples bind to the coated antigen and form a bridge to a peroxidase coupled mouse IgGantibody that will be used for detection (bridging format of the ELISA assay ). Thepositive control for this assay will be a poly clonal goat anti-murine IgG spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human plasma. 12.9.4.3 Antibodies to H uman Furin Total Ig antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM) against human Furin will be anal yzed. For this assay (ELISA), recombinant human Furin will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then incubated with dilutions of the positive control, the negative control or test sample. Antibodies against human Furin that are prese nt in the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a HRP -coupled goat anti- human antibody (secondary antibody ).

In vitro and in vivo cleavage of these ultralarge molecular fractions by ADAMTS13 and generation of characteristic satellite bands has been extensively demonstrated during nonclinical and clinical development. Nevertheless, the potential elevated risk of thrombosis and/or other thromboembolic complications due to the administration of ultra large molecular VWF multimers in subjects with normal levels of VWF cannot be completely excluded. Therefore VWF multimer anal ysis will not only be performed routinel y at screening but in case of thromboembolic events ,both VWF multimer anal ysis as well as ADAMTS13 activity will be determined to assess an y relatedness of these occurrences with I P treatment. 12.9.10.1 VWF Multimer Analysis The VWF multimer pattern will be assessed using low -resol ution sodium dodecy l sulfate (SDS) –agarose gel electrophoresis. High -resolution SDS –agarose gel electrophoresis, with agarose concentrations 1.5%, will be used to determine the satellite band structure of VWF. These anal yses will employ Western blot with luminescence video imaging. 12.9.10.2 ADAMTS13 Activity VWF73 was identified as the 73 amino acid minimal region of the VWF A2 domain required for ADAMTS13 cleavage. The cleavage of this substrate will be detected b y a commerciall y available ELISA -based Chromogenic assay (Technoclone Austria): Cleavage of immobilized VWF73 substrate is detected b y a HRP -labeled antibody directed against the cleavage site of VWF73. The amount of bound antibody, which is the function of the ADAMTS13 cleavage is detected by a chromogen ic substrate . 12.9.11 Soluble P -Selectin (sP -Selectin) sP-selectin is a cell adhesion molecule (CAM) found in granules in endothelial cells (cells lining blood vessels) and activated platelets. Data for an association between the sP-selectin concentration, TTP and venous thromboembolism (VTE ) are limited and the predictive value has not y et established. Acommercial ELISA assay will be employ ed as anexploratory test. sP -selectin will be determined at the Screening visit and used as indicator for an increased thrombotic risk.

While a negative result prac tically rules out thrombosis, a positive result can indicate thrombosis but does not rule out other potential etiologies, including a recent hemorrhage. Its main use, therefore, is to exclude thromboembolic disease where the probability is low. D -Dimer wil l be measured at the Screening visit and used as indicator for an increased thrombotic risk. 12.9.13 Additional Laboratory Testing in C ase of Severe Hypersensitivity R eactions If a subject develops a severe hypersensitivity reaction in the course of the clinical study ,additional blood will be drawn for anti-VWF IgE antibod y testing. The presence of anti-VWF IgE will be determined by using the ImmunoCAP®, a VWF -specific IgE blood test (Thermo Scientific). The basis of the ImmunoCAP® technology isa cellulose polymer as solid phase in a plastic capsule providing a large surface for protein binding. rVWF (vonicog alfa) as antigen is covalently coupled to the cellulose polymer. Detection of specific anti -VWF IgE bound to the antigen will be accomplis hed by a secondary enzy me-labeled anti -human IgE antibody . Testing for binding anti -human VWF IgE antibodies will be done with 0.5 mL plasma. Antibody containing samples will be identified and quantified in a screening assay followed by a confirmatory assa y to exclude false positive results. 12.9.14 Assessment of Laboratory Values 12.9.14.1 Assessment of Abnormal Laboratory Values For VWF and FVIII laboratory assessments no evaluation of clinical significance is necessary . Each other laboratory value (except results to dete rmine genetics of the underly ing VWD disease and blood group) has to be assessed b y the investigator and the assessment will be recorded on the eCRF . The investigator will determine for each abnormal laboratory value whether the value is considered clinica lly significant or not and provide the reference range including the units . For clinicall y significant values, the investigator will indicate if the value constitutes a new AE (see definition in Section 12.1) and record the sign, s ymptom, or medical diagnosis on the AE CRF , is a sy mptom or related to a previously recorded AE, is due to a pre -existing disease (described in Section 12.1.1.5), or is due to another issue that will be specified.

No formal statistical hypothes is test is planned for the analy sis. The primary efficacy anal ysis will be based on the FAS and will be summarized by the two c ohorts: on -demand and switch subjects .As a supportive anal ysis, the same anal ysis will also be carried out on the PP analy sis set. The spontaneous ABR while treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa) for each cohort will be estimated using a negative binomial regre ssion. The prior ABR will be based on historical data collected from each enrolled subject. The two ABR s(prior to prophy laxis treatment and while on prophy laxis) for each cohort will be compared within each subject using a generalized linear mixed -effects model (GLMM) (with a logarithmic link function , the default for the negative binomial distribution), accounting for the fixed effect of the two treatments .

The aim is to have ≥8subjects in each cohort (OD and switch). A total of at least five type 3 VWD subjects will be followed for 12 months. The sample size is driven by practical considerations (primarily the enrollment of a rare patient population) and EMA Guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Human Plasma Derived von Willebrand Factor Products (C PMP/BPWG/220/02).1 Planned Statistical Analysis The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will be composed of all subjects who receive prophylaxis IP treatment. The Safety Analysis Set will be composed of all subjects who received any amount of IP (rVWF, vonicog alpha ). The Per -Protocol (PP) Analysis Set will be composed of subjects who are at least 70% compliant regarding the number of scheduled prophylactic infusions. Only subjects who meet all study entry criteria and who have no major protocol violations that might impact primary efficacy assessments will be included in t he PP analysis set. The Pharmacokinetic Full Analysis Set (PKFAS) will be composed of all subjects who received the PK infusion and who provided acceptable data for PK and PD analysis. Acceptable PK/PD data w ill be defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan. Primary Outcome Measure: No formal statistical hypothesis test is planned for the analysis. Spontaneous ABR while treated w ith rVWF (vonicog alfa) for each cohort, on demand and switch subjects, will be estimated using a negative binomial regression. The prior ABR for each cohort w ill be based on historical data collected from each enrolled subject. The tw o ABRs (observed on the study and historical) w ill be assessed using a generalized linear mixed -effects model (GLMM) w ith the negative binomial distribut ion as a family and with a logarithmic link function (the default). The ABR ratio together with a two -sided, 95% confidence interval (CI) will be reported for each cohort. The difference in on -study ABR relative to historical ABR will be summarized d escriptively. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the FAS and will be summarized by the two cohorts: on - demand and switch subjects. As a supportive analysis, the same analysis will also be carried out on the per- PPanalysis set. Secondary Outcom e Measures: In general, data for s econdary efficacy analysis will be summarized by the two cohorts: on -demand and switch subjects and when applicable overall . Mean, standard deviation, median, range, quartiles will be calculated for continuous endpoints . Proportions will be calculated for categorical endpoints .Confidence intervals at the 95% level will be provided w hen appropriate. For non-commercial use only"

The number and proportion of pdVWF switch subjects with ABR preservation success will be reported together with the corresponding 95% two-sided CIs for the proportion. The number and proportion of subjects with categorized spontaneous ABR (i.e. 0, 1 -2, 3- 5, more than 5bleeds) will be reported descriptively. Summary statistics for the total number of infusions, as well as average number of infusions per w eek will be provided. The total w eight adjusted consumption of rVWF (vonicog alfa) during prophylactic treatment will be provided. If applicable, historical data on consumption of pdVWF prior to the study will be summarized as well. The change in spontaneous ABR from the historical rate to that during the rVWF (vonicog alfa) prophylaxis period will be summarized by location of bleeding (GI, epistaxis, joint bleeding, menorrhagia, oral and other mucosa, muscle and soft tissue, etc.). Pharm acokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD): The follow ing PK parameters, based on the initial PK assessment after a washout for on -demand subjects, will be listed and summarized descriptively for VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag and VWF:CB: IR, T 1/2, MRT, AUC 0-, AUC 0-tlast, Cmax, Tmax, V ss, and CL. The corresponding pharmacodynamics (PD) of rVWF (vonicog alfa) as measured in FVIII activity (FVIII:C), based on the initial PK assessment after a washout for on -demand subjects will be assessed using C max, Tmax, and AUC 0-tlast. These PD parameters willbe listed and summarized descriptively. PK parameters at steady state (AUC 0-tau;ss , Cmax ;ss, Tmax;ss, and C min;ss) for the partial dosing interval will be listed for on -demand subjects at the end of the study and for switch subj ects shortly after reaching steady state and at the end of the study for VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag and VWF:CB and summarized descriptively for subjects with the same dosing regimens.

(hereafter referred to as Baxalta or sponsor) ha s developed a human recombinant von Willebrand Factor (rVWF , vonicog alpha ), which is co -expressed with recombinant factor VIII (r FVIII )in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line and separated during the subsequent downstream process. To address concerns regarding the risk of transmission of blood -borne pathogens that may be introduced by human plasma, no exogenousl y added raw materials of human or animal origin are employed in the cell culture, purification, or formulation of the final container product. The only proteins present in the final container product other than rVWF (vonicog alfa) are trace quantities of murine immunoglobulin (IgG, from the immunoaffinity purification), host cell (i.e., CHO) protein, rFurin (used to further process rVWF). rVWF (v onicog alfa) is intended for the treatment of von Willebrand disease (VWD). rVWF (vonicog alfa) has been developed under the Baxalta internal code BAX111 and is used as investigational product (I P) in this study . rVWF (vonicog alfa) may be used with or wit hout ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) for the treatment of bleeding episodes (see Section 8.6.4.4). See Section 8.6for further information on the I Ps and their usage in this study . A detailed description of rVWF (vonicog alfa) is also provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). rVWF (vonicog alf a) was granted licensure in the United States in December 2015 under the brand name VONVENDI for the on- demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes in adults diagnosed with VWD and it has been available on the market in the US since 09 August 2016. I n April 2018, VONVENDI was also granted licensure in the US by the FDA for an additional indication of perioperative management of bleeding in adults (age 18 and older) diagnosed with VWD. On 31st of August 2018, European Commission implemented the decisio n for granting marketing authorization for VEYVONDI (vonicog alfa) for the treatment of haemorrhage and surgical bleeding and for the prevention of surgical bleeding in adults (age 18 and older) diagnosed with VWD, when desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or not indicated.

VWF is normally found in plasma and produced in the alpha -granules of platelets and in endothelial cell organelles known as the Weibel -Palade bodies. VWF mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular injury , one of the key functions in primary hemostasis. VWF also serves to stabilize coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), where FVIII is an essential cofactor of secondary hemostasis, which leads to fibrin clot formation.2Qualitative and/or quantitative deficiencies of VWF lead to a highl y variable bleeding diathesis known as VWD, the most common of the hereditary coagulation facto r deficiencies. Penetrance of VWD is highly variable, with only a small fraction of mildly affected patients display ing clinical sy mptoms or a family history of a bleeding diathesis. The current biochemical -based classification distinguishes disorders arising from partial quantitative (ty pe 1), qualitative (ty pe 2), or virtually complete (t ype 3) deficiencies of VWF. Up to 70% of VWD patients are diagnosed with ty pe 1 VWD, which may also be associated with minor functional defects in the molecule. In ge neral, patients with ty pe 1 VWD display mild clinical sy mptoms. Approximately 20 to 30% of VWD patients are diagnosed with ty pe 2 VWD. Ty pe 2 VWD is further divided into 4 subty pes (A, B, N, and M), reflecting distinct classes of functional abnormalities. These defects result in abnormal functional and/or multimeric distribution patterns that facilitate their diagnosis. The bleeding diathesis is usually moderate and primarily affects the mucosal tissues. Type 2N VWD patients are sometimes misdiagnosed as mi ld hemophilia A. Finally , approximately 1% percent of VWD patients exhibit a total or near total absence of VWF, which is classified as t ype 3 VWD. The incidence of ty pe 3 VWD is estimated at 0.5-1.0 x 106. This ty pe is also associated with a very low FVII I level (t ypically <5%) because the VWF carrier function for FVIII is lost. Replacement of VWF alone stabilizes endogenous FVIII, resulting in hemostatic levels within several hours post -infusion. Published results from studies of a plasma -derived VWF (pdV WF) concentrate demonstrated an increase of FVIII at an approximate rate of 5.8 1 IU dL-1h-1.3Type 3 VWD patients display severe hemorrhagic s ymptoms with bleeding predominantl y in mucosal tissues, muscle and joints. All VWD patients, particularl y those with ty pe 2 or type 3 VWD, are at an increased risk for life- threatening bleeding episodes. For non-commercial use only"

A Swedish cohort including 37 patients with t ype 3 VWD under proph ylactic median treatment of 11 years (range 2 to 45 years) was retrospectivel y anal yzed.6, 7The doses used for proph ylaxis, given once weekly for at least 45 weeks per y ear, were calculated based on 12 to 50 IU/kg bod y weight (BW ) of FVIII clotting activity (FVIII:C ) which approximately corresponded to 24- 100 IU/kg von Willebrand factor: Ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:R Co)considering that mainly Haemate with a known VWF:RCo/FVIII:C ratio of about 2 was used. An escalation of d oses from 1to 3dose levels was allowed depending on the frequency and severit y of bleeding episodes. Theresults demonstrate that under long -term prophy laxis the number of bleeds could be reduced dramatically . Whereas the median value for bleeds per y earwas about 10 before prophy laxis this value could be reduced to less than 1 bleed per y ear during prophy laxis. The benefit of proph ylaxis for such indications was retrospectivel y also demonstrated in a cohort of Italian patients including t ype 3, 2A, 2M an d type 1 patients. Prophy laxis was started after severe gastrointestinal or joint bleeding episodes and completely prevented bleeding episodes in 8 of these 11 patients and largel y reduced the need of blood transfusions in the remaining 3. A regimen of 40 IU rVWF:RCo/kg was applied every other day or twice a week. A prospective study on prophy laxis, the PRO.WILL study , has been initiated in I taly.8 The results of a prospective study investigating the prophy laxis in children and y oung adults showed a significantly reduced bleeding frequency and bleeding score (3 vs. 0.07; 3 vs. 0. p<0.001) compared to the pre-prophy laxis values. The median dose was 40(20-47) IU/kg VWF:RCo administered mainly twice weekly in 23 patients, 3 times a week in 7 patients and 4times a week in 2 children .9 The VWD Prophy laxis Network initiated the VWD International Proph ylaxis (VI P) trialto investigate the role of proph ylaxis in patients with severe VWD includin g Type 1, 2, and 3. The dose of the factor replacement product was 50 IU /kgVWF:RCo. For non-commercial use only"

For the treatment of menorrhagia th e dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo was given on the first day of menses for 2 cy cles. The frequency could be increased to Day 1 and 2 for 2 cy cles or to Day 1, 2, and 3 of menses. The study contains both retrospective and prospective study components. Results from the retrospective study component were published, including 61 subjects on prophy lactic regimen in the past 6 months prior to enrollment or subjects with a history of prophy laxis over at least 6 month .10Differences in annualized bleeding rates (ABR) within individuals (during prophylaxis – before proph ylaxis) were significant for those with primary indications of epistaxis (P = 0.0005), joint bleeding (P = 0.002) and GI bleeding (P = 0.001). The differen ce in the group whose primary indication for treatment was abnormally heavy bleeding at menstruation (n = 4) was not significant (P = 0.25). The reduction of mucosal bleeding likel y not onl y dependents on normal circulating levels of active VWF, but also o n the presence of discrete concentrations of normal VWF inside the platelets and within endothelial matrices. The low subject number (n=4) and the treatment scheme for menorrhagia on Day s 1, 2, and 3 of menses which might represent rather on -demand than pr ophy lactic treatment may also account for the outcome in this study . Results from the prospective study component were reported recentl y.11Eleven subjects completed the study . Six subjects had ty pe 2A, and 5 subjects had ty pe 3 VWD. Sixsubjects presented with epistaxis, 3 with GI bleeding, and 2 with joi nt bleeding. Seven subjects had dose escalation above the first level. Among the 10 subjects with evaluable bleeding log data, the use of proph ylaxis decreased the median ABR from 25 to 6.1 (95% confidence interval [CI ] of the rate difference: -51.6 to -1.7), and the median ABR was even lower (4.0; 95% CI : -57.5 to - 5.3) when the subjects reached their final dosing level. The authors concluded that this was the first prospective study to demonstrate that proph ylaxis with VWF concentrates is highl y effective in reducing mucosal and joint bleeding rates in clinicall y severe VWD. The results of the VI P study and previous investigations suggest that VWD patients with recurrent bleeding episodes and severe menorrhagia will benefit from a prophy lactic VWF replacem ent therapy . There is evidence that up to 40% of patients with ty pe 3 VWD experience joint bleeding which can lead to hemophilic arthropath y. Other potential indications for prophy laxis include patients with ty pe 2A or 2B VWD with recurrent gastrointestina l bleeding, menorrhagia or frequent epistaxis.4Long-term prophy laxis for most patients with ty pe 3 VWD and in some patients with ty pe 1 or 2VWD, depending on the pattern of bleedi ng, may be the treatment option of choice .

Two cohorts of patients will be included: patients currently rece iving on - demand VWF treatment (OD subjects) and patients currentl y on prophylactic treatment with pdVWF (pdVWF switch subjects) , and the aim is to have ≥8 subjects in each of the 2 cohorts, with a total of at least 5 type 3 VWD subjects followed for 12 mon ths.Enrolled subjects (i.e., subjects who have signed the informed consent form) will be eligible to participate in the study if they meet all of the inclusion criteria (see Section 9.1) and none of the exclusion criteria (see Section 9.2). 6.5Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies The following summarizes the key findings from relevant nonclinical studies as well as from the completed clinical studies 070701 (Phase 1 pha rmacokinetics [PK] and safet y in VWD), 071001 (Phase 3 safet y and efficacy in the treatment of bleeding episodes in VWD), 071101 (Phase 3 efficacy and safety in VWD subjects undergo elective surgical procedures), 071104 (Phase 1 safety and PK in hemophili a A), and 071401 (Phase 3, expanded access in a single subject with VWD) . Potential risks and efficacy of rVWF (vonicog alfa):ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) are summarized in the following sections. For additional information on nonclinical and clinical Pha se 1 results refer to the rVWF (vonicog alfa) IB. 6.5.1 Findings from Nonclinical Studies 6.5.1.1 Primary Pharmacodynamics Efficacy of rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was shown in VWD animal models, which have also low endogenous FVIII le vels. Time to occlusion and stable thrombus formation was assessed in the carotid occlusion model in VWD mice. The results demonstrated that rVWF (vonicog alfa) in combination with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) acted efficientl y in a dose -dependent manner and had higher efficacy than rVWF (vonicog alfa) alone or plasma derived (pd)VWF. These results were confirmed in an additional study assessing blood loss and survival in a tail tip bleeding model in VWD mice. I n a VWD dog ,rVWF (vonicog alfa) stabilized c anine FVIII in the circulation and significantl y reduced the bleeding time. For non-commercial use only"

Safety pharmacology studies in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits ,and dogs revealed no risks for anaph ylactoid and thrombogenic potential of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in combination with rVWF (voni cog alfa). All observations in safety pharmacology studies are considered to lie within the biological variability of animal models or occurred due to known species - specific anaph ylactoid effects of excipients. 6.5.1.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies of b oth rVWF (vonicog alfa) alone and combined with human rFVIII (rVWF+ADVATE) were conducted in VWD mice, VWD dogs, VWD pigs, rats , and cy nomolgus monkeys. Human rVWF (vonicog alfa) stabilized the endogenous FVIII in VWD mice, VWD pigs ,and VWD dogs. Furtherm ore, the h ypotheses that the area under the curve (AUC) with rVWF alone and rVWF+ADVATE is not inferior to the AUC with pdVWF (Haemate P) was tested and confirmed statistically in normal rats. ThePK characteristics of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) were n ot affected by co- administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa) in cy nomolgus monkey s. The PK data in the FVIII knock out (k.o.) mice model are inconclusive and might not be relevant for the clinical situation. However, a stabilizing effect of VWF on FVIII could be shown in a double k.o. model in a dose depend ent manner. 6.5.1.4 Toxicology Single dose toxicity studies were conducted in C57 BL/6J -mice, VWD mice, rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkeys. Rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkey s showed no signs of toxicity . Signs of microthrombosis, an exaggerated pharmacological effect, were observed in mice. Mice are not capable of sufficiently cleaving the rVWF (vonicog alfa) subunit as murine disintegrin a nd metalloproteinase with a thrombos pondin ty pe 1 motif, number 13 (ADAMTS13 )does not decrease the ultra -large molecular weight multimers of rVWF (vonicog alfa).13The observed symptoms of microthrombosis are interpreted as a species -specific exaggerated pharmacological effect. Studies evaluating the safet y of repeated administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) (dail y over 14 days) were performed in a rodent (rat) and non -rodent (cynomol gus monkey ) species. Reversible signs of exaggerated pharmacological effects (regenerative anemia, thrombocy topenia, and treatment- related histopathologic changes in the heart, liver, and spleen) were observed in rats that were administered 1400 U VWF:RCo/ kg /day + 1080 IU ADVATE/kg/day intravenousl y once daily for 14 day s.

No adverse effects could be detected in this species. There were no signs of hemoly sis, thrombosis ,or thrombocy topenia after repeated intravenous application of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa). Therefore, 100 U VWF:RCo/kg/day rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without 77 IU/kg ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was considered the no observed adverse effect level (NOAE L)in this study , which was the highest dose tested. Anti -drug antibodies, however, were formed in both species and resulted in a significant reduction in drug exposure after 14 applications as compared to a single application. These antibodies substantially reduced the sy stemic exposure to the test substance as compared to a single dose administration. No adverse effects due to ant ibody formation were observed in both species. rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was well tolerated locally and no genotoxic potential was evident after 2 in vitro and 1 in vivo genotoxicity study . A study on the influence of co-administration of VWF and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) on the immunogenicity of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in 3different hemophilic mouse models (E17 hemophilic Balb/c mice, E17 hemophilic C57BL/6J mice ,and E17 hemophilic human F8 transgenic mice) showed that rVWF (vonicog alfa) does not negativel y impact the immunogenicit y of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in any of the three different hemophilic mouse models. 6.5.2 Findings from Clinical Studies The clinical safet y, efficacy and PK were assessed in 4 completed trials: one phase 1 study (070701)) and two phase 3 studies ( 071001 and071101) that enrolled patients with VWD; one phase 1 study ( 071104 ) that enrolled patients with hemophilia A. Details on study design, populations enrolled, and safet y and effi cacy outcomes of the phase 1 studies are presented in Section 6.5.2.1 and Section 6.5.2.2, the phase 3 study in Section 6.5.2.3, and the phase 3 surgery study in Section 6.5.2.4 .

Subjects in Cohort 4 received a single intravenous infusion of rVWF:ADVATE and pdVWF/ ADVATE at 50 I U/kg VWF:RCo in random order. The primary endpoint was the tolerability and safety after single dose injections of rVWF:ADVATE at 2, 7.5, 20 ,and 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo for up to 30 day s after the last I P infusion. The data generated in this phase 1 study suggest tha t rVWF:ADVATE up to the highest investigated dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo is well tolerated and safe in adults with severe VWD. No thrombogenic risk or thrombotic thrombocy topenic purpura (TTP)-like syndrome was observed, and no neutralizing antibodies to VWF or FV III were identified. There were no deaths or other serious adverse reactions, and no infusions were interrupted or stopped due to an AE. Overall, the reported AE profile was similar between the recombinant and plasma -derived concentrates. Secondary endpoints were the PK assessment of VWF:RCo, von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag ) and multimeric composition of rVWF (vonicog alfa) as well as FVIII:C at standardized time points after single injections of rVWF:ADVATE and pdVWF:FVIII. The median VWF:RCo terminal half-life (T 1/2)of rVWF (vonicog alfa) at the 50 IU/kg dose was 16 hours. T 1/2with pdVWF:FVIII at the same dose level appeared shorter at 12.58 hours, however, the limits of the 90% CI were similar (11.73 to 17.7 hours vs. 11.87 to 18.03 hours). Themedian T1/2of VWF:RCo were shorter with the lower investigated doses: 7.13 hours and 13.23 hours with the 7.5 IU/kg and 20 IU/kg doses, although these data were derived from a much smaller number of subjects. In consequence of the missing ADAMTS13 cle avage ,ultra-large molecular weight (ULMW) multimers are contained in the rVWF (vonicog alfa) final product. The immediate cleavage of these ultra -large multimers by ADAMTS13 upon release into the circulation could be demonstrated appl ying sodium dodecy l s ulfate pol yacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) /Immunoblot with poly clonal anti -VWF antibodies to detect the resulting rVWF (vonicog alfa) subunit cleavage fragments.

All subjects underwent 3 PK anal yses: the first after infusion with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) alone, the second after infusion with ADVATE (rFVIII, octoc og alfa) plus 10 IU/kg rVWF (vonicog alfa) and the third after infusion with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) plus 50 IU/kg rVWF (vonicog alfa). The PK anal ysis was performed at intervals of approximately 8 to 14 day s. Before each infusion for PK assessment, there wasa wash -out period of at least 5 day s and the subjects were not actively bleeding. Primary outcome measures indicate that co -administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa) slightly sustain ADVATE activity with the highest observed ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) half -life of 13.74 h (CI 11.44 to16.52) after co-infusion of 50 IU/kg ADVATE plus 50 IU/kg rVWF:RCo. Thehighest improvement in ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) circulating half -life was observed in subjects with VWF:Ag levels below 100% which indicate s an association between baseline VWF:Ag levels and ADVATE (rFVIII, oc tocog alfa) half -life increase. No treatment related A Es or SAEs were reported. No subject withdrew due to an AE and there were no deaths. No binding antibodies to VWF, CHO ,and rFurin w ere detectable in the confirmatory assay and no signs of a h ypersensitivity to rVWF (vonicog alfa) or ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) antigen were observed. Laboratory values over time did not indicate an y potential safet y risk for hemophilia A patients trea ted with rVWF (vonicog alfa) and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in combination. In summary , the data indicate that rVWF (vonicog alfa) co- administered with ADVATE (rFV III, octocog alfa) up to the highest dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo is well tolerated and safe in hemophilia A patients.

The study consisted of 2parts (Part A and Part B). Part A consisted of PK assessments alone (Arm 2: PK50 onl y [without treatment of bleeding episodes]), or PK assessments (Arm 1: PK50 and Arm 3: PK 80) plus on- demand treatment period(s) of 6 months for bleeding episodes, or on -demand treatment for bleeding episodes only (Arm 4). Except for subjects in arm 2 who completed study after second PK assessment, subjects receiving treatment for PK assessmen ts and/or bleeding episodes in Part A were to be entered into Part B to continue on-demand treatment for bleeding episodes for 6additional months for a total of 12 months in the study . The primary outcome measure was the number of subjects with “treatmen t success” (extent of control of bleeding episodes), which was defined as a mean efficacy rating score of <2.5 for a subject’s I P-treated bleeding episodes during the study . The rate of subjects with treatment success was 100% (Clopper -Pearson exact 90% CI: 84.7 to 100.0) for bleeds where the assessments were made prospectivel y and excluding GI bleeds. Sensitivity anal yses confirmed the results of the primary anal ysis. Crossover results at 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo showed that the PK profile for rVWF (vonicog alfa) VWF:RCo was independent of administration alone or with rFVIII (ADVATE , octocog alpha ) (T 1/2:19.4 hours for rVWF and 16.6 hours for rVWF:rFVIII; IR: 1.8 U/dL per IU/kg infused for both rVWF and rVWF:rFVIII; mean residence time ( MRT ): 26.7 hours for rVWF a nd 25.2 hours for rVWF:rFVIII). FVIII levels increased substantially with a median peak at 24 hours of 111.0 U/dL for rVWF:rFVIII and 86.0 U/dL after rVWF alone, indicating that rVWF (vonicog alfa) induces a sustained increase in endogenous FVIII activity .The rVWF (vonicog alfa) PK profile was comparable at 50 IU/kg and 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo, and repeated PK at 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo showed close agreement between pretreatment and end -of-study results.

Using 50 IU/kg for PK measurements, subjects in the 071001 study exhibiting a T1/2for rVWF of 14, 16 ,or 19 hours had rVWF plasma concentrations at 72 hours after administration of 2.55, 4.01, and 6.49% above baseline, respectivel y, and plasma concentrations at 96 hours after administration of 0.78, 1.40 ,and 2.71% above baseline, respectively. In this context it should be noted that subjects in the present stud y who have significant spontaneous bleeding while on twice weekly prophy laxis will have their regimen increase dto 3 times per week based on clear criteria for different bleeding locations ( for details s ee Section 8.6.4.3.1). Subjects in the present study who are switching from prophy laxis with a pdVWF product will begin on rVWF (vonicog alfa) using their same weekl y total dose in IU/kg VWF:RCo used during their pdVWF proph ylaxis divided into twice weekly infusions (for details see section 8.6.4.3). A total of 125 AEs occurred in 25/37 (67.7%) subjects (62/318 infusions [19.5%]) during or after infusion with I P. Of these, 116/125 were non -serious (all mild or moderate; none were severe), and 9 SAEs were reported in 7 subjects. Of 125 total AEs, 38 were temporally associated with I P; 8 AEs were considered causally related to I P: 6 non- serious related AEs (tach ycardia, infusion site paraesthesia, electrocardiogram [ECG ] t-wave inversion, dy sgeusia, generalized pruritis, and hot flush) occurred in 4 subjects, and 2 related SAEs (chest discomfort and increased heart rate) occurred in 1subject. No deaths occurred during this study . None of the subjects developed anti- VWF or anti -FVIII neutralizing antibodies and no binding antibodies to VWF or rFurin, or antibodies against CHO protein or anti- Murine IgG were observed. No clinical or subclinical signs or sy mptoms of a thrombogenic event were observed in this study . Following an initial increase in ultralarge VWF multimers after administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa), a notable decrease in the proportion of large VWF multimers occurred between 12 and 24 hours post infusion, due to degradation by the endogenous ADAMTS13 followed by a continued decline until the end of the 96- hour follow -up period. Overal l, the data support the safe and effective use of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without rFVIII (ADVATE, octocog alpha ) in the treatment of bleeds in patients with VWD.

Eleven subjects underwent a PK assessment by infusion of 50 ± 5 IU/kg rVWF:RCo at an infusion rate of up to 4 mL/min. 12 to 24 hours before surgery , subjects received a dose of 40 to 60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo. Within 3 hours prior to surgery , the subject’s FVIII:C levels were assessed with a target of 30 IU/dL for minor and oral surgeries and 60 IU/dL for major surgeries. Within 1 hour prior to surgery, subjects received a dose of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) (depending on the target FVIII:C levels at the 3 hour assessment). VWF and FVIII IR and T 1/2for each subject, when known, were used to guide the initial dose and subsequent doses. The primary outcome measure was the overall assessment of hemostatic efficacy assessed by the investigator (hemophilia phy sician) 24 hours after last perioperative IP infusion or at completion of day 14 visit, w hichever occurred earlier, and was summarized by the percentage of subjects in each efficacy category (“excellent”, “good”, “moderate” and “none”). Point estimate and corresponding 90% two -sided exact CI was calculated for the rate of subjects with an over all assessment of hemostatic efficacy . All 15 subjects treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa) (with or without ADVATE) for major (10), minor (4), and oral (1) elective surgical procedures had overall hemostatic efficacy ratings of “excellent” or “good”. Most (73.3%) subjects had “excellent” overall hemostatic efficacy ratings; of these, 7 underwent major surgery and 4 underwent minor surgery . The remaining 26.7% subjects had “good” overall hemostatic efficacy ratings: 3 underwent major surgery and 1underwent ora l surgery. All 8 subjects with VWD Type3,the subt ype classified as absolute VWF deficiency, had overall hemostatic efficacy ratings of “excellent” (87.5%) or “good” (12.5%). Intraoperative hemostatic efficacy ratings were also rated as “excellent” or “go od” for all 15 treated subjects. Most (86.7%) subjects had “excellent” intraoperative hemostatic efficacy ratings; of these, 8 underwent major surgery , 4 underwent minor surgery , and 1 underwent oral surgery. Two (13.3%) subjects who underwent major surger y had “good” intraoperative hemostatic efficacy ratings.

The subject had an excellent response and recovery , which allowed for daily dosing of rVWF (vonicog alfa) and, within 24 hours, the subject’s bleeding had stopped. Daily dosing of rVWF (vonicog alfa) was maintained and the subject received his last dose on . The subject also received rVWF (vonicog alfa) for 7 days for prophy laxis for surgery (surgical resection of a left -kidney mass). The subject experienced no hemorrhagic complications and no AEs that were considered related to the use of rVWF (vonicog alfa). 6.6Evaluation of Anticipated Risks and Benefits of the Investigational Product(s) to Human Subjects Current treatment of VWD patients relies on desmopressin and VWF products manufactured from pooled human plasma. Human VWF produced b y recombinant technology could offer a new perspective in treatment of VWD. The benefit for the individual subject is anticipated to be significant during this clinical stud y. He/she may benefit from a product that minimizes excessive FVIII administration and thus allowing individualized dosing of VWF at optimal levels . Variations in VWF multimeric composition may lead to variability with respect to treating or preventing bleeds in VWD subjects, especially mucosal bleeds which are especiall y problematic. rVWF (vonicog alfa) product manufactured by Baxalta consistently contains ULMW VWF multimers due to the fact that the product has not been exposed to ADAMTS13.

By using a recombinant product, the risk of transmission of adventitious agents and other blood -borne pathogens associated with the use of products of human or animal origin has been eliminated. At this stage of product development, the key societal benefit is a better understanding of advanced trea tment options for VWD and enhanced product availability . These benefits outweigh the following identified or potential risks of rVWF (vonicog alfa): a llergic- type hypersensitivity reactions as with an y intravenous protein product the occurrence of thrombo embolic events the development of neutralizing antibodies to VWF Refer to the IB for further details on benefits and risks of the I P. 6.7Compliance Statement This study will be conducted in accordance with this protocol, the I nternational Council forHarmonisa tion Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 (ICH GCP, April 1996 , with Addendum E6(R2) dated Nov 2016 EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995 ), Title 21 of the US Code of Federal Regulations (US CFR), the EUDirective s2001/20/EC and 2005/28/EC, the Declaration of Helsinki and applicable national and local regulatory requirements.

The 2ndPK will be at the end of the stud y. For steady state PK, blood samples will be drawn within 30 minutes pre- infusion, and at 11 time points post - infusion (15 ± 5minutes, 30 5 minutes, 60 5 minutes, 3 ± 0.5 hours, 6 0.5hours, 120.5 hours, 24 0.5hours, 30 ± 2 hours, 48 2 hours, 72 2hours and 96 ± 2 hours) as long as it won’t interfere with subject’s the normal dosing schedule, otherwise the 96hr sampling can be omitted (see Section 11.6). F inal sample for PK analy sis should be taken before next dose is administered. 8.6.4.2 Prophylaxis Initiation Treatment The rVWF (vonicog alfa) proph ylaxis initiation treatment visit will coincide with the 962 h initial PK assessment for on -demand subjects. For pdVWF switch subjects, the rVWF (vonicog alfa) prophy laxis initiation treatment visit should occur within 42 day s after the completion of screening procedures and confirmation of eligibility . At this visit subjects will receive their proph ylaxis initiatio n dose .The proph ylaxis dose s are described inSection 8.6.4.3 . The subject will be trained on I P reconstitution and administration and may then qua lify for home treatment (see Section 8.6.4.3.2).

Examples of all dosing schedules are provided in Table 1. For pdVWF switch subjects, the weekl y dose ( IU/kg) of IP for each patient will be equivalent (± 10%) to the weekly VWF dose received during proph ylactic treatment with pdVWF. The weekl y dose of IP should be divided into 2 infusions ( Table 1, Schedule A), with a maximum of 80 IU/kg/infusion. If needed, based on the total weekly dose or other clinical judgements, the weekl y dose may be given as three infusions (Table 1, Schedule B).

Dose and frequency adjustments should be agreed with the sponsor in advance unless it constitutes an urgent safet y measure. The rationa le for dosing adjustments needs to be documented in the subject’s medical record. For both OD and switch patients, dose escalations (not exceeding the upper dose limit of 80 IU/kg rVWF:RCo) and increase of dose frequency will only be allowed in case of insufficient therapeutic response with breakthrough bleeding episodes. The c riteria for dose and/or frequency escalation are specific to each bleeding indication but, overall, involve 1 significant breakthrough bleeding episode despite the subject being compl iant with scheduled proph ylaxistreatment . For switch patients who require a dose escalation due to a breakthrough bleed, the frequency should be kept the same but the dose (IUVWF:RCo per infusion) should be increased up to 80 I U VWF:RCo. Following that, increases in frequency may be considered upon consultation with the Sponsor. For on demand subjects who require a dose escalation, at the discretion of the PI upon consultation with the Sponsor, the frequency may be kept the same but the dose (IUVWF:RCo per infusion) should be increased up to 80 I U VWF:RCo.

If a subject experiences a bleed while receiving rVWF (vonicog alfa) three times per week, the investigator should treat the bleed with rVWF (vonicog alfa) at doses up to 80IU VWF:RCo/kg at a frequency determined by the investigator until the bleed resolves. Upon resolution of the bleeding event, the subject will return to their assigned prophy laxis regimen. It is essential for the success of this study that the subjects adhere to treatment regimens. Therefore, procedures for monitoring subject’s compliance are implemented (see Section 10.7). If 1infusion of IP is missed, the subject may administer the I P as soon as possible. The subject should adhere to the irtreatment scheme ensuring a minimum interval of 12 hours between this and the previous I P infusion. For example, a s ubject routinel y infuses I P on Monday and Thursday ,he/she misses the Monday time point and therefore may infuse the IP on the next day (Tuesday )and thereafter proceed with infusing the IP on Thursday (considering a minimum 12 hours between the infusions) and return to the initial schedule.

A Subject Guideline detailing all instructions and information listed above will be provided to each subject. 8.6.4.4 Treatment of Bleeding Episodes 8.6.4.4.1 General Instructions for Home Treatment of Bleeding Episodes If a subject experiences a bleeding episode, he/she should contact the study site immediately and the site investigator should provide instructions on the treatment regimen. If the subject initia tes the treatment at home, he/she should at least follow up with the study site if a visit is needed as per the standard of care at the center . In the event a healthcare professional is required to administer treatment at the subject’s home, he/she must be trained and qualified b y the site investigator on the above procedures prior to the decision for home treatment. Once a subject has received 1infusion of rVWF (vonicog alfa) in the clinic (either during planned IP exposure or during the treatment of a bleeding episode) and meets the criteria for home treatment, the treatment of bleeding episodes with I P can be conducted at home (see Section 8.6.4.3.2). If a subject is not qualified for home treatment, rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusions must be administered at the study site. If a subject experiences a bleeding episode that requires treatment between the screening and the proph ylaxis initiation visit , the subject will be treated with I P (rVWF with or without ADVATE). Treatment with I P must occur at the study site unless the subject has previously qualified for home treatment with rVWF (vonicog alfa). If rVWF (vonicog alfa) treatment is not feasible, the subject may use his/her standard of care, such as commercial pdVWF/FVIII products. In any case a washout period of at least 5 day s is required prior to rVWF (vonicog alfa) PK infusion at the initial PK assessment visit for on-demand subjects . If a subject experiences a bleeding episode requiring treatment during the PK assessment, rVWF (vonicog alfa) should be used to treat the bleed. Blood draws for PK assessment will be stopped and the PK assessments will be repeated once the bleed has resolved and the subject is free of an y symptoms related with the bleeding episode . Dose and frequency of rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusions or any other replacement therapy to stop the bleed should be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ), and the reason for the us e of an y non -IP product or therapy should be documented .

It is the sponsor’s opinion that, in many cases, treatment with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) may not be necessary, since rVWF (vonicog alfa) proph ylaxis will serve to increase endogenous FVIII levels. However, if endogenous FVIII is below 30- 40 % or is unknown and cannot be estimated from the subject’s PK study , an infusion of rVWF: ADVATE at a nrVWF: ADVATE ratio of 1.3:1± 0.2 should be administered initially . Subsequent infusion sshould be with rVWF:RCo 40 to 60 I U/kg with or , in many cases, without 30 to 4 5 IU/kg ADVATE (only to be administered if plasma FVIII levels fall below 30 IU/L during the treatment period). Dosing may be adjusted downward or upward up to 80 IU/kg rVWF at the treating ph ysician’s discretion based upon the subject’s prior history , PK and other factors. If FV III levels are not available, dosing is at the discretion of the investigator based upon the individual subject’s PK data. Using ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in addition to rVWF (vonicog alfa) in subsequent doses carries the risk o f an excessive rise in FVIII:C. Therefore, reduced doses of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) and/or prolongation of the dose interval should be considered. The following is general guidance and the sponsor’s suggestion for treatment of breakthrough bleeds, h owever each PI will determine the treatment based on the local acceptable practice how to monitor and adjust treatment for a bleeding episode. An effort should be made to discuss with the sponsor (or sponsor’s delegate) the treatment strategy . In general t he aim of the initial dose should be full replacement of VWF with VWF:RCo levels of >0.6 IU/ml (60%) and FVIII:C of >0.4 IU/mL (40%). In major bleeding episodes, subsequent doses should keep the trough level of VWF:RCo >50% for 3 day s and then as deemed ne cessary by the investigator for subsequent days. In moderate bleeding episodes, the dose and trough level may be reduced to >30% for as long as deemed necessary by the investigator. Treatment for minor bleeding episodes will generall y consist of onl y 1 or 2 doses of rVWF (vonicog alfa) IP. If the VWF:RCo level is above 150%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 12 hours; if the VWF:RCo level is above 200%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 24 hours. In either case, a lower subs equent dose (e . g., 20 IU/kg VWF:RCo) may be appropriate. Dosing recommendations are listed in Table 3. For non-commercial use only"

In the phase 1 study 070701, 1.0 IU/kg VWF:RCo raised the circulating level of VWF:RCo by 0.017 IU/mL (1.7 %). In the same study , the observed mean half -life for rVWF (vonicog alfa) was 19.3 hours, with a standard deviation of 10.9 hours.

A diagnosis of menorrhagia will be defined by a prospectively completed Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) score >185 and normal cervical cytology or requiring use of a VWF -containing concentrate for treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding for at leas t one menstrual cycle during the prior year. Variances of up to 10% in dosing are permissible during treatment of bleeding episodes, but rounding to the nearest vial size should be avoided. Subjects with non- neutralizing binding anti -VWF antibodies should initially be treated with a dose known to be efficacious based on the subject’s medical treatment history which may differ from the recommendations provided in Table 3. Subjects should be monitored for lack of efficacy as well as for FVIII (mandatory ), VWF:RCo (mandatory ), and VWF:Ag (optional where testing is not available) levels after 3 to 6 hours. Re -dosing with rVWF (vonicog alfa) in combination w ith ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) using the same (initial) dose and adaptation of the dosing frequency should be considered until cessation of the bleed, if the FVIII and/or VWF:RCo levels drop below 30% -50% depending on bleeding severity .

Subjects who at time of screening have an alread y scheduled surgical intervention are not eligible for participation in the study . 8.6.4.5.1 Major, Minor and Oral Surgery Definition The following definitions and criteria are used to serve as a guidance for major, minor andoral surgery . Major surgeries generally refer to major orthopedic surgery (e.g., joint replacement, arthroscopic or open s ynovectomy , arthrodesis, hardware removals like plates or intramedullary nails, etc.), major abdominal surgery (e.g. open or laparosc opic hernioplasty , cholecy stectomy , colon or small bowel resection, etc.), major gy necological surgery (e.g. open or laparoscopic m yomectom y, hysterectomy, removal of endometriosis, poly ps, cysts, adhesioly sis, etc.), major head and neck surgery (e.g.: tonsillectomy , adenoidectomy , rhinoplast y, lymphadenectomy, th yroidectomy , parotidectom y. etc.), an y intracranial , cardiovascular or spinal surgery and any other surgery which has a significant risk of large volume blood loss or blood loss into a confined an atomical space. Extraction of impacted third molars is generall y also considered major surgery due to the expected difficulty of surgery and the expected blood loss. Minor surgeries generally refer to interventions such as placement of intravenous access devices, removal of small skin lesions, arthroscopy, gastroscop y, colonoscopy or conisation. Oral surgeries comprise extractions of fewer than three teeth, if the teeth are non -molars and have no bon y involvement.

As a general guidance a priming dose of 40 -60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo will be administered. If not assessed prior to the preoperative priming dose, a IR recovery may be calculated for subjects undergoing minor and oral surgery . 8.6.4.5.3 Preoperative Loading Dose An rVWF (vonicog alfa) loading dose should be administed withi n 3 hours before surgery . VWF and FVIII levels should be assessed within 3 hours prior to surgery initiation and results must be available prior to administering the loading dose. If FVIII levels prior to loading dose administration are not at least 30 IU/ dL (minor, oral surgery ), or 60 IU/dL (major surgery ) ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) will be administered in addition to rVWF (vonicog alfa) in order to raise FVIII:C levels to recommended levels. The preoperative loading dose will be calculated as the diff erence in the target peak and baseline plasma VWF:RCo levels divided by the IR ( ΔVWF:RCo x BW (kg) /IR). The PK results will be provided prior to the planned surgery . If the IR is not available, assume an IR of 1.7 IU/dL per IU/kg and calculate the initial dose as follows: (100 – baseline plasma VWF:RCo) x BW (kg) / 1.7. For minor and oral surgery , the IR from the Preoperative Priming Dose visit will be used to guide dosing and the target peak is 50-60 IU/dL VWF:RCo and 40 -50 IU/dL FVIII. For major surgery , the target peak is 100IU/dL VWF:RCo and 80- 100 IU/dL FVIII. The surgery may only start after normalization of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). 8.6.4.5.4 Intra- and Postoperative (maintenance) Dosing After the preoperative loading dose(s), subject s who have not achieved the desired postinfusion recovery will continue to receive rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) as a bolus infusion, depending on VWF and FVIII levels. The peri -and post -operative substitution regimen w ill be individualized according to the PK results, intensity and duration of the hemostatic challenge, and the institution’s standard of care.

Subjects undergoing oral surgery will be infused with rVWF (vonicog alfa) at least once within the first 8 -12 hours, targeting >30 IU/dL (rVWF and FVIII). Subjects undergoing major surg ery will be infused with rVWF (vonicog alfa) every 12-24 hours for at least the first 72 hours post -surgery , targeting a VWF:RCo and FVIII:C trough plasma level >50 IU/dL, followed by further treatment post -72 hours for as long as deemed necessary by the Investigator, targeting a VWF:RCo and FVIII:C trough plasma level of >30 IU/dL . Dose modifications based on pre -infusion VWF/FVIII levels will be performed as needed. For subsequent infusions post surgery , in case pre -infusion levels are not available prio r to the consecutive infusion in a timely manner, pre -infusion levels from the previous dose may be used by the investigator for dosing guidance. Peak plasma level guidance is matching to Section 8.6.4.4.2 A schedule of all perioperative visit assessments and laboratory sampling can be found in supplement tables in Section 20.2.1 and Section 20.3.1. 8.6.4.6 Thrombosis Prophylaxis Thromboembolic events have been reported in patients who have VWD, especiall y in the setting of known risk factors for thrombosis including low ADAMTS13 levels. Therefore, subjects who are at risk for developing thromboembolic events should be monitored for earl y signs of thrombosis, and prophylaxis measures against thromboembolism should be instituted according to current recommendations and standard of care. For all subjects who are VWD patients and are receiving VWF concentrate, attention should be given to avoid exceeding maximal recommended plasma activity level s of VWF:RCo (250 IU/dL) and FVIII (250 IU/dL). Anticoagulation measures, such as heparin, are acceptable and should follow study site standards. The investigator will record the use and reasons for such measures/agents on the appropriate CRF.

For example, the third subject who signed an informed consent form at stud y site 02 will be identified as Subject 071301- 020003. All study documents (e.g., CRFs, clinical documentation, sample containers, drug accountability logs, etc.) will be identified with the SI C. Ad ditionally , a uniquely coded SI C(s) is permitted as long as it does not contain a combination of information that allows identification of a subject (e.g., collection of a subject’s initials and birth date would not be permitted), in compliance with laws g overning data privacy . 10.3 Screening and Study Visits The study site is responsible for maintaining a screening log that includes all subjects who provided informed consent . The log also will serve to document the reason for screening failure. All screening da ta will be collected and reported in CRF, regardless of screening outcome. If a subject is re -screened, the End of Study CRF should be completed, and a new ICF, new SIC and new CRF are required for that subject. The overall study design is illustrated in t he Figure 1. Details on the procedures to be performed at each stud y visit, including screening, are provided in Supplement 20.2 „Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments “and Supplement 20.3 „Clinical Laboratory Assessments “. 10.3.1 Screening Visit Written informed consent must be obtained from each subject before an y study related procedures are performed. To initiate screening procedures, at least 72 hours must have elapsed since the last V WF administration for on -demand subjects and the subject must not be actively bleeding at the time of screening. For switch subjects, theusual interval between their pdVWF proph y infusions must have elapsed since thelastVWF administration and the subjec t must not be activel ybleeding at the time ofscreening. Multimer analy sis and VWD gene mutation analy sis should be performed at screening if not available in the subject’s medical history . For non-commercial use only"

Blood samples will be drawn within 30 minutes pre-infusion, and at 11 time points post -infusion ( 15 ± 5 minutes, 30 5 minutes, 60 5 minutes, 3 ± 0.5 hours, 6 0.5hours, 12  0.5hours, 24 0.5hours, 30 ± 2 hours, 48 2 hours, 722hours and 96 ± 2 hours). See Section 20.2 and Section 20.3. IP infusion vials from the same lot number should be used for all PK -assessments per subject. Samples for measurement of FVIII and VWF activity taken through to 6hours post -infusion will be obtained from an extremity different from that used for the infusion of IP. Where needed, the phlebotomy site will be kep t patent via an infusion of normal saline. In this event, at least 5 mL of blood will be collected and discarded before collection of the next test sample into a fresh s yringe. If the subject has a central venous catheter, the central line should be used t o administer the infusion and a peripheral venipuncture should be used to collect the blood samples.

At least 5 mL of whole blood must be collected and discarded prior to obtaining the sample. If a subject experiences a bleeding episode during the PK assessment no subsequent blood sample will be drawn in that specific PK period. The guidance provided in Section 8.6.4.4 has to be followed for the treatment of the bleeding episode. The subject once recovered is eligible to repeat the PK assessment. For pdVWF switch subjects, PK profile will not be assessed until reaching steady state after initiation of proph ylaxis (see Section 10.3.4). 10.3.3 Prophylaxis Initiation Visit The proph ylaxis initiation visit will occur a fter the blood sample for the 96 hour PK assessment is drawn for on -demand subjects or within 42 day s after screening and confirmation of eligibility for pdVWF switch subjects. T he subject will receive the first rVWF (vonicog alfa) prophy lactic dose of rVWF: RCo. Details on dose are provided in Section 8.6.4.3. Procedures and assessments at this visit include (but are not limited to) : AEs, bleeding episodes, medications taken , and non-drug therapies . Within 2 hours prior the I P infusion, a phy sical examination will be performed. Vital signs will be assessed within 30 minutes prior to I P rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusion and 30 minutes ± 15 minutes after IP infusion. Further details are provided in Supplement 20.2 and Supplement 20.3. 10.3.4 Initial Steady State PK -Assessment ( pdVWF switch subjects only) For pdVWF switch subjects, a full PK profile will be assessed at stead y state conditions on two occasions. The initial PK assessment will be performed shortl y after reaching steady state after starting proph ylaxis dosing, which is suggested after 11 day s post the 1st, around proph ylaxis dose #5- 6. The 2ndPK assessment at stead y state will be performed at the end of the study .

Vital signs will be assessed within 30 minutes prior to I P infusion and 30 minutes ± 15minutes after IP infusion. Incremental recovery (IR) will be determined at each follow -up visit based on VWF:RCo activity assessed prior t o and after IP infusion. The blood sample for IR anal ysis will be drawn within 30 minutes prior to IP infusion and 30 minutes ± 5 minutes after IP infusion. rVWF (vonicog alfa) will be infused at the regular proph ylactic dose. For each subject’s recovery analysis IP infusion ,vials from the same lot number should be used . Testing for VWF:RCo VWF:CB, rVWF:Ag, and FVIII:C level will be performed using the blood sample obtained before and after IP infusion. The blood sample prior to I P infusion will also be used for the assessment of neutralizing and binding antibodies, clinical chemistry and hematology .For on- demand subjects, a washout period of at least 72 hours after the last infusion applies before the blood draw for the immunogenicity assay s. For switch subjects, the wash out period may be reduced to the time interval between their pdVWF proph y infusions Bleeding episodes and the hemostatic efficacy will be evaluated based on the review of the patient diary . See Section 20.2 and Section 20.3. The evaluation of IP consumption and treatment compliance will be performed based on subject’s diary entries. If a subject is not compliant with the prophylactic treatment regimen and does n ot adhere to the required frequency of administration of I P infusions ( > 30% of infusions were missed within a visit interval [3 months]) the subject will be withdrawn from the study . At the 6 months ± 2 week visit an ECG will be performed and data w ill be collected. For the hemostatic efficacy assessment the following information will be recorded b y the subject in the patient diary : bleeding location, ty pe, severit y, onset and resolution date and time, infusion date and time, clinical efficacy accor ding to the rating scale.

All ty pes of bleeds, including traumatic bleeds, will be recorded. Bleeding episodes should be organized by where they occur in addition to whether they occurred spontaneously or due to a traumatic event. Bleeds occurring at the same anatomical location (e.g., right knee) with the same etiology (i.e., spontaneous versus injury ) within 24 hours after onset of the first bleed will be considered a single bleed. Bleeding occurring at multiple locations related to the same injury (e.g., knee and ankle bleeds following a fall) will be counted as a single bleeding episode. All efforts should be made to use rVWF (vonicog alfa) for treatment of bleeding episodes. If needed, t he use of a VWF concentrate other than IP for the treatment of bleeding episodes will not disqualify the subject from further participation in the study . For non-commercial use only"

However, when there is an increase in the severit y, duration, or frequency of a preexisting disease, the event must be described as “worsening” of the pre- existing condition on the AE CRF. 12.1.2 Assessment of Adverse Events For the purpose s of this study , the following will not be considered as AEs and will not be included in the analy sis of AEs. Bleeding episodes are part of the underl ying disease and therefore are not AEs; they will be evaluated in the context of efficacy . For non -serious bleeding episode scaused b y an injury, the injury would not be reported as an AE, unless it resulted in a medical finding other than a bleeding episode (e.g., abrasion of skin). Therefore, any VWD -related bleeding event (e.g., epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, musculo- skeletal bleeding, menorrhagia) that is non -serious will not be reported as an AE. However, the investigator may decide that the event is an AE if the event also would have occurred in a healthy individual under the same circumstances.  For serious bleeding episodes (bleeding SAEs): Bleeding events that meet seriousness criteria (death, life -threatening, hospitalizing/prolongation of hospitalization, disability , congenital anomal y, or medically significant andif not urgentl y treated would result in one of the above) should be captured on the SAE eCRF andreported as a n SAE to the Sponsor or designee (e.g., CRO) on an SAE Report form as described in Section 12.1.2.3 (Safet y Reporting) . Seroconversion after documented HAV/HBV vaccination prior to or during the study period.

Each AE will be evaluated b y the investigator for: Seriousness as defined in Section 12.1.1.1 Severity as defined in Section 12.1.2.1 Causal relationship to I P exposure or study procedure as defined in Section 12.1.2.2 For each AE, the outcome (i.e., recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved, recovered/resolved with sequelae, not recovered/not resolved, fatal, unknown) and if applicable , action taken with regards to the stud y treatment (i.e., dose increased, dose not changed, dose reduced, drug interrupted, drug withdrawn, not applicable, or unknown) will also be recorded on the AE CRF. Recovering/resolving AEs will be followed until resolution or until the subject’s condition returns to the level at the baseline for pr e- existing conditions . If the severity rating for an ongoing AE changes before the event resolves, the original AE report will be revised (i.e., the event will not be reported as separate AE). During the course of an y AE, the highest severit y rating will be reported. Deviations from the protocol-specified dosage (including underdosing /overdosing [<20IU/kg rVWF:RCo or >100 rVWF:RCo], abuse, and withdrawal, treatment errors (including incorrect route of administration, use of an incorrect product, and devi ations from the protocol -defined dosing schedule), failures of expected pharmacological actions, and unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefits will be followed with regard to occurrence of AEs, lack of efficacy , and/or other observations because these ev ents may be reportable to regulatory authorities. Any pregnancy that occurs after administration of IP will be reported on a Pregnancy Form and followed- up at 1 y ear post- delivery , if feasible. If an investigator becomes aware of an SAE occurring in a su bject after study completion, the SAE must be reported on the SAE Form within 24 hours after awareness: no additional reporting on CRFs is necessary .

These severity definitions will also be used to assess the severity of an AE with a study- related procedure(s), if necessary . 12.1.2.2 Causality Causality is a det ermination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the I P is etiologicall y related to/associated with the AE. Causality assessment includes, e.g., assessment of temporal relationships, dechallenge/rechallenge information, association (or lack of association) with underlying disease, presence (or absence) of a more likely cause, and ph ysiological plausibility . For each AE, the investigator will assess the causal relationship between the IP and the AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment according to the following most appropriate algorithm for the circumstances of the AE: Not related (both circumstances must be met) Is due to underl ying or concurrent illness, complications, concurrent treatments, or effects of concurrent drugs For non-commercial use only"

Hematology and clinical chemistry assessments will be performed on Ethy lenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA )-anticoagulated whole blood and serum, respectivel y, at the cent ral laboratory . 12.9.3 Immunology 12.9.3.1 Antibodies to VWF and FVIII All subjects will be tested for binding and neutralizing antibodies to VWF and FVIII at screening, at initial PK assessment, at each of the scheduled follow -up visits and at the study completion visit. Testing will be done prior to I P infusion and with at least a 72hour wash out period since the last I P infusion. If there is any suspicion of inhibitor development (e.g. excessive bleeding) binding and neutralizing antibodies to VWF and FVIII may be test ed at the discretion of the investigator. 12.9.3.2 Neutralizing and Total Binding Anti -VWF Antibodies The assay s to establish the presence of neutralizing and total binding anti -VWF antibodies have been established in the absence of international standards and with only limited numbers of positive controls. Therefore, caution is advised in interpreting positive results. I n particular, any clinical association, changes in the natural history of the disease, effect of therap y, etc. needs to be taken into account for final judgment. Thesponsor’s Medical Director should be consulted for additional advice. As part of the AE follow -up, an y sample testing positive needs to be confirmed after 2 -4 weeks for central laboratory testing. Only confirmed neutralizing anti -VWF antibodies are considered inhibitors (see Section 12.9.3.4). These subjects need to be closely monitored and therap y adjusted accordingl y. 12.9.3.3 Binding antibodies to VWF The presence of total binding anti -VWF antibodies will be determined by an enzy me- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) employ ing poly clonal anti -human Immunoglobulin (Ig)antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA). For this assay (ELI SA), recombinant h uman VWF will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then incubated with dilutions of the positive control, the negative control or test sample. Antibodies against human VWF that are present in the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -coupled goat anti- human antibody (secondary antibody ). The positive control for this assay will be a human monoclonal antibody specific for human VWF spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human plasma.

First, the sample is screened for antibodies and the titer of binding antibodies is determined. Second, the specificit y of positive antib ody results is confirmed.16 Inbrief, all sam ples are serially diluted (initial dilution 1:20 and further diluted 1:2). Thetiter endpoint, defined as the highest dilution that still gives a positive signal above cut off level, is determined in two independent duplicates. The cut off level is establi shed based on background signal level of healthy plasma donors (n=160) and set to include 5% false positives to be as sensitive as possible (95% percentile). The ELISA assay is validated allowing a nassay variability of ± 1 titer step. Therefore, differenc es ≤ 2 titers steps may be due to variability of the ELISA assay. Specificity has to be confirmed in a competition assay when a sample has a titer of 1:80 or higher in the screening assay . Based on the validation criteria samples tested in the screening as say at 1:20 or 1:40 cannot be confirmed in the competition assay . A positive screening value is confirmed if the difference between the titers determined for the subject sample (re -screen) and for the subject sample with pre -incubation (confirmation sample ) is > 2 titer steps. Antibody titers of subject samples will only be reported as positive, if the results of the screening and confirmatory anal ysis fulfill these acceptance criteria. The titer to be reported is alway s the one determined in the original screening procedure (independent of the result of the re -screening in the confirmation procedure). A more detailed test procedure will be supplied upon request or pro -actively if a sample tests positive. A treatment related increase of the binding anti -VWF antibodies is expected, if the titer increases by more than 2 titration steps. These subjects need to be closely monitored and therapy adjusted accordingly . 12.9.3.4 Neutralizing Antibodies to VWF Three functional VWF assay s, VWF:CB, VWF:RCo and VWF:FVIIIB assay s, will be used to test for the presence of neutralizing anti -VWF antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies to VWF:RCo, VWF:CB and VWF:FVIIIB activities will be measured b y assay s based on the Bethesda assay established for quantitative analy sis of FVIII inhibitor s (Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay ) .17The amount of inhibitor is expressed as BU per mL. One BU is thereb y defined as the amount of inhibitor that decreases the measured activity in the assay s to 50% of that of the negative control samples. The assay s were validated using human plasma samples from two ty pe 3 VWD patients with low (1-2 BU/mL) and high (~10 BU/mL) titer inhibitors and plasma samples from non-human primates immunized with human rVWF (vonicog alfa) (>100 BU/mL) .

However, if baseline levels are too high (>15% VWF:RCo), inhibitors may not be reliabl y detected. To exclude false positive results, the detection limit for anti- VWF i nhibitors was set to 1BU/ml for all 3 assay s. The rationale for this cut -off value is the relativel y high CIof the underl ying assay s, making determinations at the end of the evaluation range of the Bethesda reference curve uncertain.18A more detailed test procedure may be requested to further characterize the anti- VWF inhibitors, if detected. Only confirmed positive anti-VWF inhibitor test result will be reported and will be considered as a medically significant SAE. 12.9.3.5 Binding Antibodies to FVIII Binding antibodies against FVIII will be anal yzed using a proprietary enzyme immunoassay . The testing strategy will be as described for binding anti -VWF antibodies. Antibody -containing samples will be identified in a screening as say followed by a confirmatory assay to exclude false positive results. 12.9.3.6 Neutralizing Antibodies (Inhibitors) to FVIII Neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to FVIII will be assessed b y the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay in a central laboratory . To verify a FVIII inhibitor, additional testing (such as tests for L upus anticoagulants) may be initiated. Positive FVIII inhibitor tests will be defined as ≥ 0.4 BU b y the Nijmegen -modified Bethesda assay that is confirmed b y a second test performed on an independent sample obtained 2- 4 weeks following the first test. Only confirmed positive FVIII inhibitor test result will be reported. 12.9.4 Antibodies to Other Proteins Plasma will be assay ed for the presence of antibodies against CHO protein (total Ig), murine IgG and human Furin (total Ig) using proprietary enzy me immunoassay s.

For this assay (ELISA), CHO protein derived from cultures of untransfected cells and propagated under the identical cell culture con ditions used for ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) production will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then incubated with dilutions of the positive control, negative control or test sample. Antibodies against CHO protein that are present in the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a HRP- coupled goat anti-human antibody (secondary antibody ). The positive control for this assay will be a polyclonal goat anti -CHO protein antibody spiked into the negative control. The negative control for th is assay is pooled normal human plasma. 12.9.4.2 Anti -Murine IgG A commerciall y available ELI SA (Medac, Hamburg, Germany ) will be used to detect and to quantify IgG antibodies originating from human plasma that are directed against mouse -IgG (HAMA: human anti -mouse antibodies). Microtiter plates coated with mouse IgG will be incubated with dilutions of the standard, the positive control, the negative control or the test sample. Antibodies against mouse IgG that are present in thesamples bind to the coated antigen and form a bridge to a peroxidase coupled mouse IgGantibody that will be used for detection (bridging format of the ELISA assay ). Thepositive control for this assay will be a poly clonal goat anti-murine IgG spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human plasma. 12.9.4.3 Antibodies to Human Furin Total Ig antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM) against human Furin will be anal yzed.

In vitro and in vivo cleavage of these ultralarge molecular fractions by ADAMTS13 and generation of characteristic satellite bands has been extensively demonstrated during nonclinical and clinical develop ment. Nevertheless, the potential elevated risk of thrombosis and/or other thromboembolic complications due to the administration of ultra large molecular VWF multimers in subjects with normal levels of VWF cannot be completely excluded. Therefore VWF mult imer anal ysis will not only be performed routinel y at screening but in case of thromboembolic events ,both VWF multimer anal ysis as well as ADAMTS13 activity will be determined to assess an y relatedness of these occurrences with I P treatment. 12.9.10.1 VWF Multimer Analysis The VWF multimer pattern will be assessed using low- resolution sodium dodecy l sulfate (SDS) –agarose gel electrophoresis. High -resolution SDS –agarose gel electrophoresis, with agarose concentrations 1.5%, will be used to determine the satellite band structure of VWF. These anal yses will employ Western blot with luminescence video imaging. 12.9.10.2 ADAMTS13 Activity VWF73 was identified as the 73 amino acid minimal region of the VWF A2 domain required for ADAMTS13 cleavage. The cleavage of this substrate will be detected b y a commerciall y available ELISA -based Chromogenic assay (Technoclone Austria): Cleavage of immobilized VWF73 substrate is detected b y a HRP -labeled antibody directed against the cleavage site of VWF73. The amount of bound antibody, which is the function of the ADAMTS13 cleavage is detected by a chromogenic substrate. 12.9.11 Soluble P -Selectin (sP -Selectin) sP-selectin is a cell adhesion molecule (CAM) found in granules in endothelial cells (cells lining blood vessels) and activated platelets. Da ta for an association between the sP-selectin concentration, TTP and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are limited and the predictive value has not y et established. A commercial ELISA assay will be employ ed as an exploratory test. sP -selectin will be determined at the Screening visit and used as indicator for an increased thrombotic risk.

While a negative result practically rules out thrombosis, a positive result c an indicate thrombosis but does not rule out other potential etiologies, including a recent hemorrhage. Its main use, therefore, is to exclude thromboembolic disease where the probability is low. D -Dimer will be measured at the Screening visit and used as indicator for an increased thrombotic risk. 12.9.13 Additional Laboratory Testing in Case of Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions If a subject develops a severe hypersensitivity reaction in the course of the clinical study ,additional blood will be drawn for anti- VWF IgE antibod y testing. The presence of anti-VWF IgE will be determined by using the ImmunoCAP®, a VWF -specific IgE blood test (Thermo Scientific). The basis of the ImmunoCAP® technology isa cellulose polymer as solid phase in a plastic capsule providing a large surface for protein binding. rVWF (vonicog alfa) as antigen is covalently coupled to the cellulose polymer. Detection of specific anti -VWF IgE bound to the antigen will be accomplished by a secondary enzy me-labeled anti -human IgE antibody . Testing for binding anti -human VWF IgE antibodies will be done with 0.5 mL plasma. Antibody containing samples will be identified and quantified in a screening assay followed by a confirmatory assay to exclude false positive results. 12.9.14 Assessment of Laboratory Valu es 12.9.14.1 Assessment of Abnormal Laboratory Values For VWF and FVIII laboratory assessments no evaluation of clinical significance is necessary . Each other laboratory value (except results to determine genetics of the underly ing VWD disease and blood group) has to be assessed b y the investigator and the assessment will be recorded on the eCRF. The investigator will determine for each abnormal laboratory value whether the value is considered clinically significant or not and provide the reference range including t he units . For clinicall y significant values, the investigator will indicate if the value constitutes a new AE (see definition in Section 12.1) and record the sign, s ymptom, or medical diagnosis on the AE CRF, is a sy mptom or related to a previously recorded AE, is due to a pre -existing disease (described in Section 12.1.1.5), or is due to another issue that will be specified.

Dosage may be individualized w ithin this range based on: available historical PK data type and severity of bleeding episodes the subject has experienced in the past monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory measures The starting dose can, after consultation with the Sponsor, be increased up to 80U/kg if considered necessary to assure effective prophylaxis. Subjects switching from pdVWF prophylaxis treatment: the w eekly dose (IU/kg) of rVWF (vonicog alfa) for each patient will be equivalent (± 10%) to the w eekly VWF dose received during prophylactic treatment with pdVWF. The w eekly dose should be divided int o 2 infusions, with a maximum of 80 IU/kg/infusion. If needed, based on the total w eekly dose or other clinical judgements, the weekly dose may be given as three infusions. A once weekly dose regimen will be allow ed after switch to rVWF (vonicog alfa) if t he patient has been on a once weekly dose regimen with pdVWF. Dose and dose interval may, after consultation with the sponsor, be further individualized based on: available historical PK data type and severity of bleeding episodes the subject has experienced in the past monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory measures Treatment of Bleeding Episodes: Dosage must be individualized based on the subject’s weight, type and severity of bleeding episode and monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory measures. In general, an initial dose of 40 -60 IU/kg VWF:RCo w ithor without 30-45 IU rFVIII [ADVATE , octocog alfa ]/kg is recommended (rVWF:rFVIII ratio of 1.3:1: ± 0.2). In cases of major bleeding episodes, a dose of up to 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo may be infused. Subsequent doses, if necessary, will be administered with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) to maintain VWF:RCo and FVIII levels for as long as deemed necessary by the investigator.

The aim is to have ≥8subjects in each cohort (OD and switch). A total of at least five type 3 VWD subjects will be followed for 12 months. The sample size is driven by practical considerations (primarily the enrollment of a rare patient population) and EMA Guideline on the Clinical Investigation of Human Plasma Derived von Willebrand Factor Products (CPMP/BPWG/220/02).1 Planned Statistical Analysis The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will be composed of all subjects who receive prophylaxis IP treatment. The Safety Analysis Set will be composed of all subjects who received any amount of IP (rVWF, vonicog alpha ). The Per -Protocol (PP) Analysis Set will be composed of subjects who are at least 70% compliant regarding the number of scheduled prophylactic infusions. Only subjects who meet all study entry criteria and who have no major protocol violations that might impact primary efficacy assessments w ill be included in the PP analysis set. The Pharmacokinetic Full Analysis Set (PKFAS) will be composed of all subjects who received the PK infusion and who provided acceptable data for PK and PD analysis. Acceptable PK/PD data w ill be defined in the Statis tical Analysis Plan. Primary Outcome Measure: No formal statistical hypothesis test is planned for the analysis. Spontaneous ABR while treated w ith rVWF (vonicog alfa) for each cohort, on demand and switch subjects, will be estimated using a negative binom ial regression. The prior ABR for each cohort w ill be based on historical data collected from each enrolled subject. The tw o ABRs (observed on the study and historical) w ill be assessed using a generalized linear mixed -effects model (GLMM) w ith the negativ e binomial distribution as a family and with a logarithmic link function (the default). The ABR ratio together with a two -sided, 95% confidence interval (CI) will be reported for each cohort. The difference in on -study ABR relative to historical ABR will be summarized d escriptively. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the FAS and will be summarized by the two cohorts: on - demand and switch subjects. As a supportive analysis, the same analysis will also be carried out on the per- PPanalysis set. Secondary Outcome Measures: In general, data for s econdary efficacy analysis will be summarized by the two cohorts: on -demand and switch subjects and when applicable overall . Mean, standard deviation, median, range, quartiles will be calculated for contin uous endpoints . Proportions will be calculated for categorical endpoints .Confidence intervals at the 95% level will be provided w hen appropriate. For non-commercial use only"

The number and proportion of pdVWF switch subjects with ABR preservation success will be reported together with the corresponding 95% two-sided CIs for the proportion. The number and proportion of subjects with categorized spontaneous ABR (i.e. 0, 1 -2, 3- 5, more than 5bleeds) will be reported descriptively. Summary statistics for the total number of infusions, as well as average number of infusions per w eek will be provided. The total w eight adjusted consumption of rVWF (vonicog alfa) during prophylactic treatment will be provided. If applicable, historical data on consumption of pdVWF prior to the study will be summarized as well. The change in spontaneous ABR from the historical rate to that during the rVWF (vonicog alfa) prophylaxis period will be summarized by location of bleeding (GI, epistaxis, joint bleeding, menorrhagia, oral and other mucosa, muscle and soft tissue, etc.). Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD): The follow ing PK parameters, based on the initial PK assessment after a w ashout for on -demand subjects, will be listed and summarized descriptively for VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag and VWF:CB: IR, T 1/2, MRT, AUC 0-, AUC 0-tlast, Cmax, Tmax, V ss, and CL. The corresponding pharmacodynamics (PD) of rVWF (vonicog alfa) as measured in FVIII activity (FVIII:C), based on the initial PK assessment after a washout for on -demand subjects will be assessed using C max, Tmax, and AUC 0-tlast. These PD parameters willbe listed and summarized descriptively. PK parameters at steady state (AUC 0-tau;ss , Cmax ;ss, Tmax;ss, and C min;ss) for the partial dosing interval will be listed for on -demand subjects at the end of the study and for switch subjects shortly after reaching steady state and at the end of the study for VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag and VWF:CB and summarize d descriptively for subjects with the same dosing regimens. The corresponding pharmacodynamics (PD) of rVWF (vonicog alfa) as measured in FVIII activity (FVIII:C) will be assessed using AUC 0-tau;ss, Cmax;ss, Tmax;ss, and C min; ss. These PD parameters will b e listed for on -demand subjects at the end of the study and for switch subjects shortly after reaching steady state and at the end of the study and will be summarized descriptively for subjects with the same dosing regimens. For the on -demand subjects, th e PK of VWF:RCo w ill be analyzed using a population PK approach to characterize the single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics, including associated variability, of VWF:RCo in the study population. For the switch subjects, differences in AUC 0-tau;ss , Cmax;ss, and C min;ssassessess shortly after reaching steady state and assessed at the end of the study will be assessed by ratio of geometric means and corresponding two-sided 95% confidence intervals for VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, VWF:CB, and FVIII:C. The difference in Tmax;ss, betw een first and second pharmacokinetic assessment will be summarized by the median and range (minimum to maximum) for VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag ,VWF:CB , and FVIII:C.

For all subjects activity/concentration vs. time curves will be prepared. Safety: Safety analysis will be performed overall and by the two cohorts: on -demand and switch subjects. Treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs with start dates on or after the first exposure to IP. Summaries of AEs will be based on TEAEs unless otherwise indicated. Occurrence of AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) will be summarized descriptively, by system organ class and prefe rred term. The number and percentage of subjects who experienced AEs and SAEs, and the number of AEs and SAEs will be tabulated. In addition, the number of subjects who experienced AEs assessed as related to IP by the investigator, and the number of IP -related AEs will be tabulated. The number of patients with AEs by severity will be presented similarly. A listing of all AEs will be presented by subject identifier, age, sex, preferred term and reported term of the AE, duration, severity, seriousness, action taken, outcome, causality assessment by investigator, onset date, stop date and medication or non -drug therapy to treat the AE. Temporally associated AEs are defined as AEs that begin during infusion or within 24 hours (or 1 day where time of onset is no t available) after completion of infusion, irrespective of being related or not related to treatment. Temporally associated AEs will be presented in summary tables. Adverse events of special interest (AESI), such as hypersensitivity reactions and thromboem bolic events, will be monitored throughout the study and statistical analysis will be conducted based on the search criteria (eg, standardized MedDRA queries [SMQ]) determined prior to database lock, and summarized. For immunogenicity analysis f requency counts and proportions will be calculated for subjects with the occurrence of neutralizing (inhibitory) antibodies to VWF and FVIII, occurrence of binding antibodies to VWF and FVIII, and occurrence of binding antibodies to CHO proteins, mouse imm unoglobulin G (IgG) and rFurin .

(hereafter referred to as Baxalta or sponsor) ha s developed a human recombinant von Willebrand Factor (rVWF , vonicog alpha ), which is co -expressed with recombinant factor VIII (r FVIII )in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line and separated during the subsequent downstream process. To address concerns regarding the risk of transmission of blood -borne pathogens that may be introduced by human plasma, no exogenousl y added raw materials of human or animal origin are employed in the cell culture, purification, or formulation of the final container product. The only proteins present in the final container product other than rVWF (vonicog alfa) are trace quantities of murine immunoglobulin (IgG, from the immunoaffinity purification), host cell (i.e., CHO) protein, rFurin (used to further process rVWF). rVWF (v onicog alfa) is intended for the treatment of von Willebrand disease (VWD). rVWF (vonicog alfa) has been developed under the Baxalta internal code BAX111 and is used as investigational product (I P) in this study . rVWF (vonicog alfa) may be used with or wit hout ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) for the treatment of bleeding episodes (see Section 8.6.4.4). See Section 8.6for further information on the I Ps and their usage in this study . A detailed description of rVWF (vonicog alfa) is also provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). rVWF (vonicog alf a) was granted licensure in the United States in December 2015 under the brand name VONVENDI for the on- demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes in adults diagnosed with VWD and it has been available on the market in the US since 09 August 2016. I n April 2018, VONVENDI was also granted licensure in the US by the FDA for an additional indication of perioperative management of bleeding in adults (age 18 and older) diagnosed with VWD. On 31st of August 2018, European Commission implemented the decisio n granting marketing authorization for VEYVONDI (vonicog alfa) for the treatment of haemorrhage and surgical bleeding and for the prevention of surgical bleeding in adults (age 18 and older) diagnosed with VWD, when desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or not indicated.

1027,page_1027,"rVWF Page 25of 134 Clinical Study Protocol Identifier: 071301 2018 SEP 13 BAX ALTA CONFIDENTIAL – RESTRICTED: DO NOT D ISTRIBUTE WITHOUT PR IOR APPROVAL6.2Clinical Condition/Indication Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) is a large multimeric gl ycoprotein with a molecular weight that varies from 500 to 20,000 kDa. VWF is normally found in plasma and produced in the alpha -granules of pla telets and in endothelial cell organelles known astheWeibel -Palade bodies. VWF mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites ofvascular injury , one of the key functions in primary hemostasis. VWF also serves to stabilize coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), where FVIII is an essential cofactor of secondary hemostasis, which leads to fibrin clot formation.2Qualitative and/or quantitative deficiencies of VWF lead to a highl y variable bleeding diathesis known as VWD, the most common of the hereditary coagulation factor de ficiencies. Penetrance of VWD is highly variable, with only a small fraction of mildly affected patients display ing clinical sy mptoms or a family history of a bleeding diathesis. The current biochemical -based classification distinguishes disorders arising from partial quantitative (ty pe 1), qualitative (ty pe 2), or virtually complete (t ype 3) deficiencies of VWF. Up to 70% of VWD patients are diagnosed with ty pe 1 VWD, which may also be associated with minor functional defects in the molecule. In general, p atients with ty pe 1 VWD display mild clinical sy mptoms. Approximately 20 to 30% of VWD patients are diagnosed with ty pe 2 VWD. Ty pe 2 VWD is further divided into 4 subty pes (A, B, N, and M), reflecting distinct classes of functional abnormalities. These de fects result in abnormal functional and/or multimeric distribution patterns that facilitate their diagnosis. The bleeding diathesis is usually moderate and primarily affects the mucosal tissues. Type 2N VWD patients are sometimes misdiagnosed as mild hemop hilia A. Finally , approximately 1% percent of VWD patients exhibit a total or near total absence of VWF, which is classified as t ype 3 VWD. The incidence of ty pe 3 VWD is estimated at 0.5-1.0 x 106. This ty pe is also associated with a very low FVIII level (typically <5%) because the VWF carrier function for FVIII is lost. Replacement of VWF alone stabilizes endogenous FVIII, resulting in hemostatic levels within several hours post -infusion. Published results from studies of a plasma -derived VWF (pdVWF) conc entrate demonstrated an increase of FVIII at an approximate rate of 5.8 1 IU dL-1h-1.3Type 3 VWD patients display severe hemorrhagic s ymptoms with bleeding predominantly in mucosal tissues, muscle and joints. All VWD patients, particularl y those with ty pe 2 or type 3 VWD, are at an increased risk for life- threatening bleeding episodes. For non-commercial use only"

A Swedish cohort including 37 patients with t ype 3 VWD under proph ylactic median treatment of 11 years (range 2 to 45 years) was retrospectivel y anal yzed.6, 7The doses used for proph ylaxis, given once weekly for at least 45 weeks per y ear, were calculated based on 12 to 50 IU/kg bod y weight (BW ) of FVIII clotting activity (FVIII:C ) which approximately corresponded to 24- 100 IU/kg von Willebrand factor: Ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:R Co)considering that mainly Haemate with a known VWF:RCo/FVIII:C ratio of about 2 was used. An escalation of d oses from 1to 3dose levels was allowed depending on the frequency and severit y of bleeding episodes. Theresults demonstrate that under long -term prophy laxis the number of bleeds could be reduced dramatically . Whereas the median value for bleeds per y earwas about 10 before prophy laxis this value could be reduced to less than 1 bleed per y ear during prophy laxis. The benefit of proph ylaxis for such indications was retrospectivel y also demonstrated in a cohort of Italian patients including t ype 3, 2A, 2M an d type 1 patients. Prophy laxis was started after severe gastrointestinal or joint bleeding episodes and completely prevented bleeding episodes in 8 of these 11 patients and largel y reduced the need of blood transfusions in the remaining 3. A regimen of 40 IU rVWF:RCo/kg was applied every other day or twice a week. A prospective study on prophy laxis, the PRO.WILL study , has been initiated in I taly.8 The results of a prospective study investigating the prophy laxis in children and y oung adults showed a significantly reduced bleeding frequency and bleeding score (3 vs. 0.07; 3 vs. 0. p<0.001) compared to the pre-prophy laxis values. The median dose was 40(20-47) IU/kg VWF:RCo administered mainly twice weekly in 23 patients, 3 times a week in 7 patients and 4times a week in 2 children .9 The VWD Prophy laxis Network initiated the VWD International Proph ylaxis (VI P) trial to investigate the role of prophy laxis in patients with severe VWD includin g Type 1, 2 , and 3. The dose of the factor replacement product was 50 IU /kgVWF:RCo. For non-commercial use only"

For the treatment of menorrhagia th e dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo was given on the first day of menses for 2 cy cles. The frequency could be increased to Day 1 and 2 for 2 cy cles or to Day 1, 2, and 3 of menses. The study contains both retrospective and prospective study components. Results from the retrospective study component were published, including 61 subjects on prophy lactic regimen in the past 6 months prior to enrollment or subjects with a history of prophy laxis over at least 6 month .10Differences in annualized bleeding rates (ABR) within individuals (during prophylaxis – before proph ylaxis) were significant for those with primary indications of epistaxis (P = 0.0005), joint bleeding (P = 0.002) and GI bleeding (P = 0.001). The differen ce in the group whose primary indication for treatment was abnormally heavy bleeding at menstruation (n = 4) was not significant (P = 0.25). The reduction of mucosal bleeding likel y not onl y dependents on normal circulating levels of active VWF, but also o n the presence of discrete concentrations of normal VWF inside the platelets and within endothelial matrices. The low subject number (n=4) and the treatment scheme for menorrhagia on Day s 1, 2, and 3 of menses which might represent rather on -demand than pr ophy lactic treatment may also account for the outcome in this study . Results from the prospective study component were reported recentl y.11Eleven subjects completed the study . Six subjects had ty pe 2A, and 5 subjects had ty pe 3 VWD. Sixsubjects presented with epistaxis, 3 with GI bleeding, and 2 with joi nt bleeding. Seven subjects had dose escalation above the first level. Among the 10 subjects with evaluable bleeding log data, the use of proph ylaxis decreased the median ABR from 25 to 6.1 (95% confidence interval [CI ] of the rate difference: -51.6 to -1.7), and the median ABR was even lower (4.0; 95% CI : -57.5 to - 5.3) when the subjects reached their final dosing level. The authors concluded that this was the first prospective study to demonstrate that proph ylaxis with VWF concentrates is highl y effective in reducing mucosal and joint bleeding rates in clinicall y severe VWD. The results of the VI P study and previous investigations suggest that VWD patients with recurrent bleeding episodes and severe menorrhagia will benefit from a prophy lactic VWF replacem ent therapy . There is evidence that up to 40% of patients with ty pe 3 VWD experience joint bleeding which can lead to hemophilic arthropath y. Other potential indications for prophy laxis include patients with ty pe 2A or 2B VWD with recurrent gastrointestina l bleeding, menorrhagia or frequent epistaxis.4Long-term prophy laxis for most patients with ty pe 3 VWD and in some patients with ty pe 1 or 2VWD, depending on the pattern of bleedi ng, may be the treatment option of choice .

Two cohorts of patients will be included: patients currently rece iving on - demand VWF treatment (OD subjects) and patients currentl y on prophylactic treatment with pdVWF (pdVWF switch subjects) , and the aim is to have ≥8 subjects in each of the 2 cohorts, with a total of at least 5 type 3 VWD subjects followed for 12 mon ths.Enrolled subjects (i.e., subjects who have signed the informed consent form) will be eligible to participate in the study if they meet all of the inclusion criteria (see Section 9.1) and none of the exclusion criteria (see Section 9.2). 6.5Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies The following summarizes the key findings from relevant nonclinical studies as well as from the completed clinical studies 070701 (Phase 1 pha rmacokinetics [PK] and safet y in VWD), 071001 (Phase 3 safet y and efficacy in the treatment of bleeding episodes in VWD), 071101 (Phase 3 efficacy and safety in VWD subjects undergo elective surgical procedures), 071104 (Phase 1 safety and PK in hemophili a A), and 071401 (Phase 3, expanded access in a single subject with VWD) . Potential risks and efficacy of rVWF (vonicog alfa):ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) are summarized in the following sections. For additional information on nonclinical and clinical Pha se 1 results refer to the rVWF (vonicog alfa) IB. 6.5.1 Findings from Nonclinical Studies 6.5.1.1 Primary Pharmacodynamics Efficacy of rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was shown in VWD animal models, which have also low endogenous FVIII le vels. Time to occlusion and stable thrombus formation was assessed in the carotid occlusion model in VWD mice. The results demonstrated that rVWF (vonicog alfa) in combination with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) acted efficientl y in a dose -dependent manner and had higher efficacy than rVWF (vonicog alfa) alone or plasma derived (pd)VWF. These results were confirmed in an additional study assessing blood loss and survival in a tail tip bleeding model in VWD mice.

Safety pharmacology studies in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits ,and dogs revealed no risks for anaph ylactoid and thrombogenic potential of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in combination with rVWF (voni cog alfa). All observations in safety pharmacology studies are considered to lie within the biological variability of animal models or occurred due to known species - specific anaph ylactoid effects of excipients. 6.5.1.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies of b oth rVWF (vonicog alfa) alone and combined with human rFVIII (rVWF+ADVATE) were conducted in VWD mice, VWD dogs, VWD pigs, rats , and cy nomolgus monkeys. Human rVWF (vonicog alfa) stabilized the endogenous FVIII in VWD mice, VWD pigs ,and VWD dogs. Furtherm ore, the h ypotheses that the area under the curve (AUC) with rVWF alone and rVWF+ADVATE is not inferior to the AUC with pdVWF (Haemate P) was tested and confirmed statistically in normal rats. ThePK characteristics of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) were n ot affected by co- administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa) in cy nomolgus monkey s. The PK data in the FVIII knock out (k.o.) mice model are inconclusive and might not be relevant for the clinical situation. However, a stabilizing effect of VWF on FVIII could be shown in a double k.o. model in a dose depend ent manner. 6.5.1.4 Toxicology Single dose toxicity studies were conducted in C57 BL/6J -mice, VWD mice, rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkeys. Rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkey s showed no signs of toxicity . Signs of microthrombosis, an exaggerated pharmacological effect, were observed in mice. Mice are not capable of sufficiently cleaving the rVWF (vonicog alfa) subunit as murine disintegrin a nd metalloproteinase with a thrombos pondin ty pe 1 motif, number 13 (ADAMTS13 )does not decrease the ultra -large molecular weight multimers of rVWF (vonicog alfa).13The observed symptoms of microthrombosis are interpreted as a species -specific exaggerated pharmacological effect. Studies evaluating the safet y of repeated administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) (dail y over 14 days) were performed in a rodent (rat) and non -rodent (cynomol gus monkey ) species. Reversible signs of exaggerated pharmacological effects (regenerative anemia, thrombocy topenia, and treatment- related histopathologic changes in the heart, liver, and spleen) were observed in rats that were administered 1400 U VWF:RCo/ kg /day + 1080 IU ADVATE/kg/day intravenousl y once daily for 14 day s.

No adverse effects could be detected in this species. There were no signs of hemoly sis, thrombosis ,or thrombocy topenia after repeated intravenous application of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa). Therefore, 100 U VWF:RCo/kg/day rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without 77 IU/kg ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was considered the no observed adverse effect level (NOAE L)in this study , which was the highest dose tested. Anti -drug antibodies, however, were formed in both species and resulted in a significant reduction in drug exposure after 14 applications as compared to a single application. These antibodies substantially reduced the sy stemic exposure to the test substance as compared to a single dose administration. No adverse effects due to ant ibody formation were observed in both species. rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was well tolerated locally and no genotoxic potential was evident after 2 in vitro and 1 in vivo genotoxicity study . A study on the influence of co-administration of VWF and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) on the immunogenicity of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in 3different hemophilic mouse models (E17 hemophilic Balb/c mice, E17 hemophilic C57BL/6J mice ,and E17 hemophilic human F8 transgenic mice) showed that rVWF (vonicog alfa) does not negativel y impact the immunogenicit y of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in any of the three different hemophilic mouse models. 6.5.2 Findings from Clinical Studies The clinical safet y, efficacy and PK were assessed in 4 completed trials: one phase 1 study (070701)) and two phase 3 studies ( 071001 and071101) that enrolled patients with VWD; one phase 1 study ( 071104 ) that enrolled patients with hemophilia A.

Subjects in Cohort 4 received a single intravenous infusion of rVWF:ADVATE and pdVWF/ ADVATE at 50 I U/kg VWF:RCo in random order. The primary endpoint was the tolerability and safety after single dose injections of rVWF:ADVATE at 2, 7.5, 20 ,and 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo for up to 30 day s after the last I P infusion. The data generated in this phase 1 study suggest tha t rVWF:ADVATE up to the highest investigated dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo is well tolerated and safe in adults with severe VWD. No thrombogenic risk or thrombotic thrombocy topenic purpura (TTP)-like syndrome was observed, and no neutralizing antibodies to VWF or FV III were identified. There were no deaths or other serious adverse reactions, and no infusions were interrupted or stopped due to an AE. Overall, the reported AE profile was similar between the recombinant and plasma -derived concentrates. Secondary endpoints were the PK assessment of VWF:RCo, von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag ) and multimeric composition of rVWF (vonicog alfa) as well as FVIII:C at standardized time points after single injections of rVWF:ADVATE and pdVWF:FVIII. The median VWF:RCo terminal half-life (T 1/2)of rVWF (vonicog alfa) at the 50 IU/kg dose was 16 hours. T 1/2with pdVWF:FVIII at the same dose level appeared shorter at 12.58 hours, however, the limits of the 90% CI were similar (11.73 to 17.7 hours vs. 11.87 to 18.03 hours). Themedian T1/2of VWF:RCo were shorter with the lower investigated doses: 7.13 hours and 13.23 hours with the 7.5 IU/kg and 20 IU/kg doses, although these data were derived from a much smaller number of subjects. In consequence of the missing ADAMTS13 cle avage ,ultra-large molecular weight (ULMW) multimers are contained in the rVWF (vonicog alfa) final product. The immediate cleavage of these ultra -large multimers by ADAMTS13 upon release into the circulation could be demonstrated appl ying sodium dodecy l s ulfate pol yacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) /Immunoblot with poly clonal anti -VWF antibodies to detect the resulting rVWF (vonicog alfa) subunit cleavage fragments.

All subjects underwent 3 PK anal yses: the first after infusion with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) alone, the second after infusion with ADVATE (rFVIII, octoc og alfa) plus 10 IU/kg rVWF (vonicog alfa) and the third after infusion with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) plus 50 IU/kg rVWF (vonicog alfa). The PK anal ysis was performed at intervals of approximately 8 to 14 day s. Before each infusion for PK assessment, there wasa wash -out period of at least 5 day s and the subjects were not actively bleeding. Primary outcome measures indicate that co -administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa) slightly sustain ADVATE activity with the highest observed ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) half -life of 13.74 h (CI 11.44 to16.52) after co-infusion of 50 IU/kg ADVATE plus 50 IU/kg rVWF:RCo. Thehighest improvement in ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) circulating half -life was observed in subjects with VWF:Ag levels below 100% which indicate s an association between baseline VWF:Ag levels and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) half -life increase. No treatment related A Es or SAEs were reported. No subject withdrew due to an AE and there were no deaths. No binding antibodies to VWF, CHO ,and rFurin were detectable in the confirmatory assay and no signs of a h ypersensitivity to rVWF (vonicog alfa) or ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) antigen were observed. Laboratory values over time did not indicate an y potential safet y risk for hemophilia A patients treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa) and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in combination. In summary , the data indicate that rVWF (vonicog alfa) co- administered with ADVATE (rFV III, octocog alfa) up to the highest dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo is well tolerat ed and safe in hemophilia A patients.

The study consisted of 2parts (Part A and Part B). Part A consisted of PK assessments alone (Arm 2: PK50 onl y [without treatment of bleeding episodes]), or PK assessments (Arm 1: PK50 and Arm 3: PK80) plus on -demand treatment period(s) of 6 months for bleeding episodes, or on -demand treatment for bleeding episodes only (Arm 4). Except for subjects in arm 2 who completed study after second PK assessment, subjects receiving treatment for PK assessments and/or bleeding episodes in Part A were to be entered into Part B to continue on-demand treatment for bleeding episodes for 6additional months for a total of 12 months in the study . The primary outcome measure was the number of subjects with “treatment success” (extent of control of bleeding episodes), which was defined as a mean e fficacy rating score of <2.5 for a subject’s I P -treated bleeding episodes during the study . The rate of subjects with treatment success was 100% (Clopper -Pearson exact 90% CI: 84.7 to 100.0) for bleeds where the assessments were made prospectivel y and excl uding GI bleeds. Sensitivity anal yses confirmed the results of the primary anal ysis. Crossover results at 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo showed that the PK profile for rVWF (vonicog alfa) VWF:RCo was independent of administration alone or with rFVIII (ADVATE , octocog al pha) (T 1/2:19.4 hours for rVWF and 16.6 hours for rVWF:rFVIII; IR: 1.8 U/dL per IU/kg infused for both rVWF and rVWF:rFVIII; mean residence time ( MRT ): 26.7 hours for rVWF and 25.2 hours for rVWF:rFVIII). FVIII levels increased substantially with a median peak at 24 hours of 111.0 U/dL for rVWF:rFVIII and 86.0 U/dL after rVWF alone, indicating that rVWF (vonicog alfa) induces a sustained increase in endogenous FVIII activity . The rVWF (vonicog alfa) PK profile was comparable at 50 IU/kg and 80 IU/kg VWF:RC o, and repeated PK at 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo showed close agreement between pretreatment and end -of-study results.

Using 50 IU/kg for PK measurements, subjects in the 071001 study exhibiting a T1/2for rVWF of 14, 16 ,or 19 hours had rVWF plasma concentrations at 72 hours after administration of 2.55, 4.01 ,and 6.49% above baseline, respectivel y, and plasma concentrations at 96 hours after administration of 0.78, 1.40 ,and 2.71% above baseline, respectively. In this context it should be noted that subjects in the present stud y who have significant spontan eous bleeding while on twice weekly prophy laxis will have their regimen increase dto 3 times per week based on clear criteria for different bleeding locations (for details s ee Section 8.6.4.3.1). Subjects in the present study who are switching from prophy laxis with a pdVWF product will begin on rVWF (vonicog alfa) using their same weekl y total dose in IU/kg VWF:RCo used during their pdVWF proph ylaxis divided into twice weekly infusions (for details see section 8.6.4.3). A total of 125 AEs occurred in 25/37 (67.7%) subjects (62 /318 infusions [19.5%]) during or after infusion with I P. Of these, 116/125 were non -serious (all mild or moderate; none were severe), and 9 SAEs were reported in 7 subjects. Of 125 total AEs, 38 were temporally associated with I P; 8 AEs were considered ca usally related to I P: 6 non- serious related AEs (tach ycardia, infusion site paraesthesia, electrocardiogram [ECG ] t-wave inversion, dy sgeusia, generalized pruritis, and hot flush) occurred in 4 subjects, and 2 related SAEs (chest discomfort and increased h eart rate) occurred in 1subject. No deaths occurred during this study . None of the subjects developed anti- VWF or anti -FVIII neutralizing antibodies and no binding antibodies to VWF or rFurin, or antibodies against CHO protein or anti -Murine IgG were obs erved. No clinical or subclinical signs or sy mptoms of a thrombogenic event were observed in this study . Following an initial increase in ultralarge VWF multimers after administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa), a notable decrease in the proportion of large VWF multimers occurred between 12 and 24 hours post infusion, due to degradation b y the endogenous ADAMTS13 followed by a continued decline until the end of the 96- hour follow -up period. Overall, the data support the safe and effective use of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without rFVIII (ADVATE, octocog alpha ) in the treatment of bleeds in patients with VWD.

Eleven subjects underwent a PK assessment by infusion of 50 ± 5 IU/kg rVWF:RCo at an infusion rate of up to 4 mL/min. 12 to 24 hours before surgery , subjects received a dose of 40 to 60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo. Within 3 hours prior to surgery , the subject’s FVIII:C levels were assessed with a target of 30 IU/dL for minor and oral surgeries and 60 IU/dL for major surgeries. Within 1 hour prior to surgery, subjects received a dose of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) (depending on the target FVIII:C levels at the 3 hour assessment). VWF and FVIII IR and T 1/2for each subject, when known, were used to guide the initial dose and subsequent doses. The primary outcome measure was the overall assessment of hemostatic efficacy assessed by the investigator (hemophilia phy sician) 24 hours after last perioperative IP infusion or at completion of day 14 visit, w hichever occurred earlier, and was summarized by the percentage of subjects in each efficacy category (“excellent”, “good”, “moderate” and “none”). Point estimate and corresponding 90% two -sided exact CI was calculated for the rate of subjects with an over all assessment of hemostatic efficacy . All 15 subjects treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa) (with or without ADVATE) for major (10), minor (4), and oral (1) elective surgical procedures had overall hemostatic efficacy ratings of “excellent” or “good”. Most (73.3%) subjects had “excellent” overall hemostatic efficacy ratings; of these, 7 underwent major surgery and 4 underwent minor surgery .

The median daily postoperative weight -adjusted dose of rVWF (vonicog alfa) (with or without ADVATE )was 23.5 IU/kg on postoperative Day 1 (n=3) and 25.5 IU/kg on postoperative Day 14 (n=2) .Insubjects treated with rVWF:ADVATE, the daily postoperative weight -adjusted dose was 16.9 IU/kg rVWF and 7.6 IU/kg ADVATE on postoperative Day 1 (n=1) and decreased to 50.8 IU/kg rVWF and 7.6 IU/kg ADVATE on postoperative Day 7 (n=1). For subjects treat ed with rVWF alone, the median weight -adjusted dose (Q1, Q3) of rVWF was 35.4 IU/kg on postoperative Day 1 (n=2) and decreased to 23.7 IU/kg on postoperative Day 7 (n=4) and 25.5 IU/kg on postoperative Day 14(n=2). A total of 11 subjects were evaluated fo r PK in the study . As expected, postinfusion increases in concentrations of VWF:RCo, VWF:Ac, VWF:Ag, and VWF collagen binding ( VWF:CB ) were observed. Mean values for VWF:RCo were as follows: AUC0 -∞/dose was 37.50 hours*IU/dL per IU/kg infused; AUC0- 72h/do se was 34.08 hours*IU/dL per IU/kg infused; T1/2 was 17.83 hours; MRT was 24.32 hours; CLwas 0.03117 dL/hour/kg; and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss)was 0.6837 dL/kg. Median values for VWF:RCo were as follows: AUC0- ∞/dose was 32.94 hours*IU/dL per IU/kg infused; AUC0- 72h/dose was 31.70 hours*IU/ dL per IU/kg infused; T1/2 was 14.62 hours; MRT was 21.80 hours; CL was 0.03036 dL/hour/kg; and Vss was 0.7078 dL /kg. The VWF:RCo activity was consistent with that previously observed in clini cal studies 071001 and 070701. rVWF (vonicog alfa) was safe and well tolerated in adults with severe VWD undergoing major, minor, and oral elective surgical procedures.

For the initial rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusion, the subject received a test dose of 5% of thetotal dose of 60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo at an infusion rate of 1 mL/min. After a 10 to 15-minute observation period, no adverse symptoms or signs were noted and the subject received the remaining 95% of the total dose. The subject was monitored for an y signs of an allergic reaction, and none were noted. Treatment with rVWF (vonicog alfa) every 12to 24 hours was to continue at th e discretion of the investigator based on VWF levels and clinical s ymptomatology . The subject had an excellent response and recovery , which allowed for daily dosing of rVWF (vonicog alfa) and, within 24 hours, the subject’s bleeding had stopped. Daily dosi ng of rVWF (vonicog alfa) was maintained and the subject received his last dose on . The subject also received rVWF (vonicog alfa) for 7 days for prophy laxis for surgery (surgical resection of a left -kidney mass). The subject experienced no hemorrhagic complications and no AEs that were considered related to the use of rVWF (vonicog alfa). 6.6Evaluation of Anticipated Risks and Benefits of the Investigational Product(s) to Human Subjects Current treatment of VWD patients relies on desmopressin and VWF products manufactured from pooled human plasma. Human VWF produced b y recombinant technology could offer a new perspective in treatment of VWD. The benefit for the individual subject is anticipated to be significant during this clinical stud y. He/s he may benefit from a product that minimizes excessive FVIII administration and thus allowing individualized dosing of VWF at optimal levels . Variations in VWF multimeric composition may lead to variability with respect to treating or preventing bleeds in VWD subjects, especially mucosal bleeds which are especiall y problematic. rVWF (vonicog alfa) product manufactured by Baxalta consistently contains ULMW VWF multimers due to the fact that the product has not been exposed to ADAMTS13.

By using a recombinant product, the risk of tra nsmission of adventitious agents and other blood -borne pathogens associated with the use of products of human or animal origin has been eliminated. At this stage of product development, the key societal benefit is a better understanding of advanced treatme nt options for VWD and enhanced product availability . These benefits outweigh the following identified or potential risks of rVWF (vonicog alfa): a llergic- type hypersensitivity reactions as with an y intravenous protein product the occurrence of thrombo embolic events the development of neutralizing antibodies to VWF Refer to the IB for further details on benefits and risks of the I P. 6.7Compliance Statement This study will be conducted in accordance with this protocol, the I nternational Council forHarmonisatio n Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 (ICH GCP, April 1996 , with Addendum E6(R2) dated Nov 2016 EMA/CHMP/ICH/135/1995 ), Title 21 of the US Code of Federal Regulations (US CFR), the EUDirective s2001/20/EC and 2005/28/EC, the Declaration of Helsinki and applicable national and local regulatory requirements.

The 2ndPK will be at the end of the stud y. For steady state PK, blood samples will be drawn within 30 minutes pre- infusion, and at 11 time points post - infusion (15 ± 5 minutes, 30 5 minutes, 60 5 minutes, 3 ± 0.5 hours, 6 0.5hours, 120.5 hours, 24 0.5hours, 30 ± 2 hours, 482 hours, 72 2 hours and 96 ± 2 hours) as long as it won’t interfere with subject’s the normal dosing schedule, otherwise the 96hr sampling can be omitted (see Section 11.6). Final sample for PK analy sis should be taken before next dose is administered. 8.6.4.2 Prophylaxis Initiation Treatment The rVWF (vonicog alfa) proph ylaxis initiation treatment visit will coincide with the 962 h initial PK as sessment for on -demand subjects. For pdVWF switch subjects, the rVWF (vonicog alfa) prophy laxis initiation treatment visit should occur within 42 day s after the completion of screening procedures and confirmation of eligibility . At this visit subjects will receive their proph ylaxis initiation dose .The proph ylaxis dose s are described inSection 8.6.4.3 .

Examples of all dosing schedules are provided in Table 1. For pdVWF switch subjects, the weekl y dose (IU/kg) of IP for each patient will be equivalent (± 10%) to the weekly VWF dose received during proph ylactic treatment with pdVWF. The weekl y dose of IP should be divided into 2 infusions ( Table 1, Schedule A), with a maximum of 80 IU/kg/infusion. If needed, based on the total weekly dose or other clinical judgements, the weekl y dose may be given as three infu sions (Table 1, Schedule B).

Dose and frequency adjustments should be agreed with the sponsor in advance unless it constitutes an urgent safet y measure. The rationale for dosing adjustments needs to be documented in the subject’s medical record . For both OD and switch patients, dose escalations (not exceeding the upper dose limit of 80 IU/kg rVWF:RCo) and increase of dose frequency will only be allowed in case of insufficient therapeutic response with breakthrough bleeding episodes. The criteria for dose and/or frequency escalation are specific to each bleeding indication but, overall, involve 1 significant breakthrough bleeding episode despite the subject being compliant with scheduled proph ylaxis treatment. For switch patients who require a do se escalation due to a breakthrough bleed, the frequency should be kept the same but the dose (IUVWF:RCo per infusion) should be increased up to 80 I U VWF:RCo. Following that, increases in frequency may be considered upon consultation with the Sponsor. Fo r on demand subjects who require a dose escalation, at the discretion of the PI upon consultation with the Sponsor, the frequency may be kept the same but the dose (IUVWF:RCo per infusion) should be increased up to 80 I U VWF:RCo.

If a subject experiences a bleed while receiving rVWF (vonicog alfa) three times per week, the investigator should treat the bleed with rVWF (vonicog alfa) at doses up to 80IU VWF:RCo/kg at a frequency determined by th e investigator until the bleed resolves. Upon resolution of the bleeding event, the subject will return to their assigned prophy laxis regimen. It is essential for the success of this study that the subjects adhere to treatment regimens. Therefore, procedu res for monitoring subject’s compliance are implemented (see Section 10.7). If 1infusion of IP is missed, the subject may administer the I P as soon as possible. The subject should adhere to the irtreatment scheme ensuring a minimum interval of 12 hours between thi s and the previous I P infusion. For example, a s ubject routinel y infuses I P on Monday and Thursday ,he/she misses the Monday time point and therefore may infuse the IP on the next day (Tuesday )and thereafter proceed with infusing the IP on Thursday (consi dering a minimum 12 hours between the infusions) and return to the initial schedule. If more than 30% of infusions of I P are missed within the visit interval of 3 months the subject will be discontinued from the stud y (see Section 9.4). 8.6.4.3.2 General Instructions for Home Treatment for Prophylaxis At the discretion of the investigator, a subject may be considered suitable for home treatment only after the subject has received at least 1infusion of I P in the clinic, either during planned proph ylactic IP exposure or during the treatment of bleeding episodes, and meets the following additional criteria : 1.Fully understands the concept o f a clinical study and related documentation (documented training of at least 30 minutes), 2.Has a history of previous experience with home treatment including self-administration and treatment with VWF containing concentrates, 3.Has adequate time for initia l training of the stud y drug preparation (preparation, mixing and infusion of the I P(s) (documented training of at least 30 minutes) .

In the event a healthcare professional is required to administer IP, he/she must be trained and qualified by the investigator on the above procedures prior to the decision for home treatment. A Subject Guideline detailing all instructions and information listed above will be provided to each subject. 8.6.4.4 Treatment of Bleeding Episodes 8.6.4.4.1 General Instructions for Home Treatment of Bleeding Episodes If a subject experiences a bleeding episode, he/she should contact the study site immediately and the site investigator should provide instructions on the treatment regimen. If the subject initiates the treatment at home, he/she should at least follow up with the study site if a visit is needed as per the standard of care at the center . In the event a healthcare professional is required to administer treatment at the subject’s home, he/she must be trained and qualified b y the site investigator on the above procedures prior to the decision for home treatment .Once a subject has received 1infusion of rVWF (vonicog alfa) in the clinic (either during planned IP exposure or during the treatment of a bleeding episode) and meets the criteria for home treatment, th e treatment of bleeding episodes with I P can be conducted at home (see Section 8.6.4.3.2). If a subject is not qualified for home treatment, rVWF (v onicog alfa) infusions must be administered at the study site. If a subject experiences a bleeding episode that requires treatment between the screening and the proph ylaxis initiation visit , the subject will be treated with I P (rVWF with or without ADVATE) . Treatment with I P must occur at the study site unless the subject has previously qualified for home treatment with rVWF (vonicog alfa). If rVWF (vonicog alfa) treatment is not feasible, the subject may use his/her standard of care, such as commercial pdV WF/FVIII products. In any case a washout period of at least 5 day s is required prior to rVWF (vonicog alfa) PK infusion at the initial PK assessment visit for on-demand subjects . If a subject experiences a bleeding episode requiring treatment during the PK assessment, rVWF (vonicog alfa) should be used to treat the bleed. Blood draws for PK assessment will be stopped and the PK assessments will be repeated once the bleed has resolved and the subject is free of an y symptoms related with the bleeding episode .Dose and frequency of rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusions or any other replacement therapy to stop the bleed should be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ), and the reason for the use of an y non -IP product or therapy should be documented .

It is the sponsor’s opinion that, in many cases, treatment with ADVA TE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) may not be necessary, since rVWF (vonicog alfa) proph ylaxis will serve to increase endogenous FVIII levels. However, if endogenous FVIII is below 30-40 % or is unknown and cannot be estimated from the subject’s PK study , an infusi on of rVWF: ADVATE at a nrVWF: ADVATE ratio of 1.3:1± 0.2 should be administered initially . Subsequent infusion sshould be with rVWF:RCo 40 to 60 I U/kg with or , in many cases, without 30 to 45 I U/kg ADVATE (only to be administered if plasma FVIII levels fall below 30 IU/L during the treatment period). Dosing may be adjusted downward or upward up to 80 IU/kg rVWF at the treating ph ysician’s discretion based upon the subject’s prior history , PK and other factors. If FV III levels are not available, dosing is at the discretion of the investigator based upon the individual subject’s PK data. Using ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in addition to rVWF (vonicog alfa) in subsequent doses carries the risk of an excessive rise in FVIII:C. Therefore, reduced doses of ADV ATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) and/or prolongation of the dose interval should be considered. The following is general guidance and the sponsor’s suggestion for treatment of breakthrough bleeds, however each PI will determine the treatment based on the local acceptable practice how to monitor and adjust treatment for a bleeding episode. An effort should be made to discuss with the sponsor (or sponsor’s delegate) the treatment strategy . In general the aim of the initial dose should be full replacement of VWF wi th VWF:RCo levels of >0.6 IU/ml (60%) and FVIII:C of >0.4 IU/mL (40%). In major bleeding episodes, subsequent doses should keep the trough level of VWF:RCo >50% for 3 day s and then as deemed necessary by the investigator for subsequent days. In moderate bleeding episodes, the dose and trough level may be reduced to >30% for as long as deemed necessary by the investigator. Treatment for minor bleeding episodes will generall y consist of onl y 1 or 2 doses of rVWF (vonicog alfa) IP. If the VWF:RCo level is abo ve 150%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 12 hours; if the VWF:RCo level is above 200%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 24 hours. In either case, a lower subsequent dose (e .g., 20 IU/kg VWF:RCo) may be appropriate. Dosing recommendations are listed in Table 3. For non-commercial use only"

In the phase 1 study 070701, 1.0 IU/kg VWF:RCo raised the circulating level of VWF:RCo by 0.017 IU/mL (1.7 %). In the same study , the observed mean half -life for rVWF (vonicog alf a) was 19.3 hours, with a standard deviation of 10.9 hours.

A diagnosis of menorrhagia will be defined by a prospectively completed Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) score >185 and normal cervical cytology or requiring use of a VWF -containing concentrate for treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding for at least one menstrual cycle during the prior year. Variances of up to 10% in dosing are permissible during treatment of bleeding episodes, but rounding to the nearest vial size should be avoided. Subjects with non- neutralizing binding anti -VWF antibodies should initially be treated with a dose known to be efficacious based on the subject’s medical treatment history which may differ from the recommen dations provided in Table 3. Subjects should be monitored for lack of efficacy as well as for FVIII (mandatory ), VWF:RCo (mandatory ), and VWF:Ag (optio nal where testing is not available) levels after 3 to 6 hours. Re -dosing with rVWF (vonicog alfa) in combination with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) using the same (initial) dose and adaptation of the dosing frequency should be considered until cessation of the bleed, if the FVIII and/or VWF:RCo levels drop below 30% -50% depending on bleeding severity .

Subjects who at time of screening have an alread y scheduled surgical intervention are not eligible for participation in the study . 8.6.4.5.1 Major, Minor and O ral Surgery Definition The following definitions and criteria are used to serve as a guidance for major, minor and oral surgery . Major surgeries generally refer to major orthopedic surgery (e.g., joint replacement, arthroscopic or open s ynovectomy , arthrodesis, hardware removals like plates or intramedullary nails, etc.), major abdominal surgery (e.g. open or laparoscopic hernioplasty , cholecy stectomy , colon or small bowel resection, etc.), major gy necological surgery (e.g. open or laparoscopic m yomectom y, hysterectomy, removal of endometriosis, poly ps, cysts, adhesioly sis, etc.), major head and neck surgery (e.g.: tonsillectomy , adenoidectomy , rhinoplast y, lymphadenectomy, th yroidectomy , parotidectom y. etc.), an y intracranial , cardiovascular or spinal surgery and any other surgery which has a significant risk of large volume blood loss or blood loss into a confined anatomical space. Extraction of impacted third molars is generall y also considered major surgery due to the expected difficulty of surgery and the expected blood loss. Minor surgeries generally refer to interventions such as placement of intravenous access devices, removal of small skin lesions, arthroscopy, gastroscop y, colonoscopy or conisation. Oral surgeries comprise extractions of fewer than three teeth, if the teeth are non -molars and have no bon y involvement.

As a general guidance a priming dose of 40 -60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo will be administered. If not assessed prior to the preoperative priming dose, a IR recovery may be calculated for subjects undergoing minor and oral surgery . 8.6.4.5.3 Preoperative Loading Dose An rVWF (vonicog alfa) loading dose should be administed within 3 hours before surgery . VWF and FVIII levels should be assessed within 3 hours prior to surgery initiation and results must be available prior to administering the loading dose. If FVIII levels prior to loading dose administration are not at least 30 IU/dL (minor, oral surgery ), or 60 IU/dL (major surgery ) ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) will be administered in addition to rVWF (vonicog alfa) in order to raise FVIII:C levels to recommended levels. The preoperative loading dose will be calculated as the difference in the target peak and baseline plasma VWF:RCo levels divided by the IR ( ΔVWF:RCo x B W (kg) /IR). The PK results will be provided prior to the planned surgery. If the IR is not available, assume an IR of 1.7 IU/dL per IU/kg and calculate the initial dose as follows: (100 –baseline plasma VWF:RCo) x BW (kg) / 1.7. For minor and oral surger y, the IR from the Preoperative Priming Dose visit will be used to guide dosing and the target peak is 50-60 IU/dL VWF:RCo and 40 -50 IU/dL FVIII. For major surgery , the target peak is 100IU/dL VWF:RCo and 80- 100 IU/dL FVIII. The surgery may only start after normalization of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). 8.6.4.5.4 Intra- and Postoperative (maintenance) Dosing After the preoperative loading dose(s), subjects who have not achieved the desired postinfusion recovery will continue to receive rVWF (v onicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) as a bolus infusion, depending on VWF and FVIII levels. The peri -and post -operative substitution regimen will be individualized according to the PK results, intensity and duration of the hemostatic challenge, and the institution’s standard of care.

Subjects undergoing oral surgery will be infused with rVWF (vonicog alfa) at least once within the first 8 -12 hours, targeting >30 IU/dL (rVWF and FVIII). Subjects undergoing major surgery will be infused with rVWF (vonicog alfa) every 12-24 hours for at least the first 72 hours post -surgery , targeting a VWF:RCo and FVIII:C trough plasma level >50 IU/dL, followed by further treatment post -72 hours for as long as deemed necessary by the Investigator, targeting a VWF:RCo and FVIII:C trough plasma level of >30 IU/dL . Dose modif ications based on pre- infusion VWF/FVIII levels will be performed as needed. For subsequent infusions post surgery , in case pre -infusion levels are not available prior to the consecutive infusion in a timely manner, pre -infusion levels from the previous do se may be used by the investigator for dosing guidance. Peak plasma level guidance is matching to Section 8.6.4.4.2 A schedule of all perioperative visit assessments and laboratory sampling can be found in supplement tables in Section 20.2.1 and Section 20.3.1. 8.6.4.6 Thrombosis Prophylaxis Thromboembolic events have been reported in patients who have VWD, especiall y in the setting of known risk factors for thrombosis including low ADAMTS13 leve ls. Therefore, subjects who are at risk for developing thromboembolic events should be monitored for earl y signs of thrombosis, and prophylaxis measures against thromboembolism should be instituted according to current recommendations and standard of care. For all subjects who are VWD patients and are receiving VWF concentrate, attention should be given to avoid exceeding maximal recommended plasma activity levels of VWF:RCo (250 IU/dL) and FVIII (250 IU/dL). Anticoagulation measures, such as heparin, are a cceptable and should follow study site standards. The investigator will record the use and reasons for such measures/agents on the appropriate CRF.

Subjects with chronic hepatitis B or C develop ALT/AST levels exceeding 5 times the ULN for 1month . 3. Subjects who experience se vere hypersensitivity reactions, e.g., anaph ylaxis upon exposure to rVWF (vonicog alfa) . 4. Subjects who develop a neutralizing inhibitor to rVWF (vonicog alfa) and/or ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) (biological assays) that results in significant clinical effe ct, including but not limited to increasing the weekl y dose of rVWF by >50%. 5.Subjects who demonstrate clinical signs of thrombo embolic events . 6. The subject becomes pregnant. IP exposure will be discontinued. Attempts will be made to follow the subject through completion of the pregnancy and up to 1 y ear post delivery , if feasible. The investigator will record a narrative description of the course of the pregnancy and its outcome. 7. The subject begins lactating. IP exposure will be discontinued. The investigator will record a narrative description of the course of the bab y’s development. 8.The subject is not compliant with the prophy lactic treatment r egimen and does not adhere to the frequency of IP administration. Once >30% of infusions are missed within a visit interval (3 months), the subject will be discontinued from further participation in the study . 9.The subject repeatedly uses other VWF product s for prophy laxis or for the treatment of bleeding episodes in the absence of an acceptable justification to the sponsor.

For example, the th ird subject who signed an informed consent form at stud y site 02 will be identified as Subject 071301- 020003. All study documents (e.g., CRFs, clinical documentation, sample containers, drug accountability logs, etc.) will be identified with the SI C. Addit ionally , a uniquely coded SI C(s) is permitted as long as it does not contain a combination of information that allows identification of a subject (e.g., collection of a subject’s initials and birth date would not be permitted), in compliance with laws governing data privacy . 10.3 Screening and Study Visits The study site is responsible for maintaining a screening log that includes all subjects who provided informed consent . The log also will serve to document the reason for screening failure. All screening data will be collected and reported in CRF, regardless of screening outcome. If a subject is re -screened, the End of Study CRF should be completed, and a new ICF, new SIC and new CRF are required for that subject. The overall study design is illustrated in the Figure 1. Details on the procedures to be performed at each stud y visit, including screening, are provided in Supplement 20.2 „Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments“ and Supplement 20.3 „Clinical Laboratory Assessments “. 10.3.1 Screening Visit Written informed consent must be obtained from each subject before an y study related procedures are performed. To initiate screening procedures, at least 72 hours must have elapsed since the last VWF administration for on -demand subjects and the subject must not be actively bleeding at the time of screening. For switch subjects, the usual interval between their pdVWF proph y infusions must have elapsed since the last VWF administration and the subject must not be actively bleeding at the time of screening. Multimer analysis and VWD gene mutation analy sis should be performed atscreening if not available in the subject’s medical history . For non-commercial use only"

All screening procedures and confirmation of eligibility shall take place within 42days prior to the firstinfusion of IP . If the IP is not infused within 42days, all screening assessments except blood group, human leukocy te antigen ( HLA), genetics , multimeric pattern and , must be repeated to reconfirm eligibility . Refer to Supplement 20.2 and Supplement 20.3. Upon completion of screening procedures, subject eligibility will be confirmed by the sponsor on a subject eligibility form before additional study procedures are undertaken. The subject will maintain a diary that will include infusion logs (see Section 10.5). The allocation of IP will be initiated after the subject has qualified for home treatment (see Section 8.6.4.3.2 ). In the event of a subject experiencing a bleeding episode that requires treatment between the screening visit and the subsequent visit (i.e. initial PK assessment visit for on- demand subjects or proph ylaxis initiation visit for switch subjects), the subject will be treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa). If rVWF (vonicog alfa) is not available for an y reason, e.g., subject not y et trained on IP administration, study site visit for I Padministration not feasible, etc., the subject may use his/her standard of care, such as commercial pdVWF/FVIII products, and the reason for the use of non -IP products should be clearl y documented. 10.3.2 Baseline Visit –Initial PK Assessment (On -demand Subject s Only) After screening and confirmation of eligibility on-demand subjects will undergo an initial PK assessment. S ubjects will receive a dose of 50 ± 5 IU/kg rVWF:RCo to determine VWF and FVIII levels. Blood samples will be drawn within 30 minutes pre-infusion, and at 11 time points post -infusion ( 15 ± 5 minutes, 30 5 minutes, 60 5 minutes, 3 ± 0.5 hours, 6 0.5hours, 12  0.5hours, 24 0.5hours, 30 ± 2 hours, 48 2 hours, 722hours and 96 ± 2 hours). See Section 20.2 and Section 20.3. IP infusion vial s from the same lot number should be used for all PK -assessments per subject. Samples for measurement of FVIII and VWF activity taken through to 6hours post -infusion will be obtained from an extremity different from that used for the infusion of IP. Where needed, the phlebotomy site will be kept patent via an infusion of normal saline. In this event, at least 5 mL of blood will be collected and discarded before collection of the next test sample into a fresh s yringe. If the subject has a central venous cat heter, the central line should be used to administer the infusion and a peripheral venipuncture should be used to collect the blood samples.

At least 5 mL of whole blood must be collected and discarded prior to obtaining the sample. If a subject experiences a b leeding episode during the PK assessment no subsequent blood sample will be drawn in that specific PK period. The guidance provided in Section 8.6.4.4 has to be followed for the treatment of the bleeding episode. The subject once recovered is eligible to repeat the PK assessment. For pdVWF switch subjects, PK profile will not be assessed until reaching steady state after initiation of proph ylaxis (se e Section 10.3.4). 10.3.3 Prophylaxis Initiation Visit The proph ylaxis initiation visit will occur a fter the blood sample for the 96 hour PK assessment is drawn for on -demand subjects or within 42 day s after screening and confirmation of eligibility for pdVWF switch subjects. T he subject will receive the first rVWF (vonicog alfa) prophy lactic dose of rVWF: RCo. Details on dose are provided in Section 8.6.4.3. Procedures and assessments at this visit include (but are not limited to) : AEs, bleeding episodes, medications taken , and non-drug therapies. Within 2 hours prior the I P infusion, a phy sical examination will be performed. Vital signs will be assessed within 30 minutes prior to I P rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusion and 30 minutes ± 15 minutes after IP infusion. Further details are provid ed in Supplement 20.2 and Supplement 20.3. 10.3.4 Initial Steady State PK -Assessment ( pdVWF switch subjects only) For pdVWF switch subjects, a full PK profile will be assessed at stead y state conditions on two occasions. The initial PK assessment will be performed shortl y after reaching steady state after starting prophy laxis dosing, which is suggested after 11 day s post the 1st, around proph ylaxis dose #5 -6. The 2ndPK assessment at stead y state will be performed at the end of the study . Blood samples will be drawn within 30 minutes pre -infusion, and at 11 time points post-infusion (15 ± 5 minutes, 30 5 minutes, 60 5 minutes, 3 ± 0.5 hours, 60.5hours, 12 0.5 hours, 24 0.5hours, 30 ± 2 hours, 48 2 hours, 72 2hours and 96 ± 2 hours).

Within 2 hours prior to the rVWF (vonicog alfa) IP infusion, a phy sical examination will be performed. Vital signs will be assessed within 30 minutes prior to I P infusion and 30 minutes ± 15minutes after IP infusion. Incremental recovery (IR) will be det ermined at each follow- up visit based on VWF:RCo activity assessed prior to and after IP infusion. The blood sample for IR anal ysis will be drawn within 30 minutes prior to IP infusion and 30 minutes ± 5 minutes after IP infusion. rVWF (vonicog alfa) will be infused at the regular proph ylactic dose. For each subject’s recovery analysis IP infusion ,vials from the same lot number should be used . Testing for VWF:RCo VWF:CB, rVWF:Ag, and FVIII:C level will be performed using the blood sample obtained before a nd after IP infusion. The blood sample prior to I P infusion will also be used for the assessment of neutralizing and binding antibodies, clinical chemistry and hematology .For on- demand subjects, a washout period of at least 72 hours after the last infusi on applies before the blood draw for the immunogenicity assay s. For switch subjects, the wash out period may be reduced to the time interval between their pdVWF proph y infusions Bleeding episodes and the hemostatic efficacy will be evaluated based on the r eview of the patient diary . See Section 20.2 and Section 20.3. The evaluation of IP consumption and treatment compliance will b e performed based on subject’s diary entries. If a subject is not compliant with the prophylactic treatment regimen and does not adhere to the required frequency of administration of I P infusions ( > 30% of infusions were missed within a visit interval [3 months]) the subject will be withdrawn from the study . At the 6 months ± 2 week visit an ECG will be performed and data will be collected. For the hemostatic efficacy assessment the following information will be recorded b y the subject in the patient diary : bleeding location, ty pe, severit y, onset and resolution date and time, infusion date and time, clinical efficacy according to the rating scale. If at any time during the stud y a subject’s bleeding episode does not adequatel y respond to rVWF (vonicog alfa) therapy , he/she will be evaluated for the presence of neutralizing and total binding antibodies.

For subjects whose completion date is extended beyond the 12 -month visit due to delay in continuation study start -up, the 12 -month ± 2 weeks visit will be considered as a follow -up visit, and EOS visit will be performed once the s ubject can rollover into the continuation study, from 12month ± 2 weeks to 15 month ± 2 weeks post prophylaxis initiation visit, as applicable. Both the 12- month ± 2 weeks visit rescheduled as a follow -up visit, and the rescheduled EOS visit will be recorded in the CRF. 10.4 Medications and Non -Drug Therapies The following medications and non- drug therapies are notpermitted within 30 days before stud y entry and during the course of the study : Medications: Immunomodulating drugs other than anti -retroviral chemotherap y (e.g., -interferon, or corticosteroid agents at a dose equivalent to hy drocortisone greater than 10 mg/day)and an extended treatment period 3 months. Another investigational and/or interventional study drug (except rVWF and FVIII administe red under the surgery protocol ). A subject who has taken any of these medications or received an y of these non- drug therapies during the study will be withdrawn from the study . The following medications are permitted during the course of the stud y: Antifi brinoly tics (e.g., tranexamic acid, -amino caproic acid) or topical hemostats as needed, according to each institution’s standard of care . These may be used, in accordance with local standard clinical practice, as the initial or only treatment for minor and moderate bleeding events. However, if the bleeding has not stopped within 24 hour following administration of this non -VWF treatment, infusion(s) with rVWF (vonicog alfa) should be started per protocol Emergent use of a VWF concentrate other than rVWF ( vonicog alfa) may be permissible under certain circumstances (see Section 8.6.4.4.1) Details of all adjunctive hemostatic medication used ,includin g dose and reason for use, must be recorded in the eCRF.

If a subject terminates participation in the study and does not return for termination visit, his/her last recorded assessments shall remain with thelast visit. The reason for discontinuation will be recorded, and the data collected up to the time of discontinuation will be used in the anal ysis and included in the clinical study report. If additional assessments are required, the assessments shall be recorded separatel y. Assessments to be performed at the termination visit (including in cases of withdraw or discontinuation) can be found in Supplement 20.2 Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments and Supplement 20.3 Clinical L aboratory Assessments . In the event of subject discontinuation due to an AE, clinical and/or laboratory investigations that are beyond the scope of the required study observations/assessments may be performed as part of the evaluation of the event. These investigations will take place under the direction of the investigator in consultation with the sponsor, and the details of the outcome may be reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities by the sponsor. 10.7 Procedures for Monitoring Subject Compliance Subject compliance with the procedures of this study (treatment regime ns and study visits) will be monitored by the investigator or/a licensed healthcare professional at the study site. During the regular scheduled follow -up visits a direct review of the subject’s source data (e- diaries) will be performed at the sites and evaluated against the protocol requirements. In addition drug accountability will be e valuated at each follow -up study visit and the study termination visit by comparing the infusions recorded in the subject diary with empty vials returned by each subject to the study site, and the study site’s dispensing record.

The following details on bleeding episodes will be recorded b y the subject in the electronic diary (for home treatment), the subject’s healthcare provider in the site’s source documents (fortreatments away from the primary investigative site), or by authorized, qualified personnel at the participating site in the subject’s medical records (for hospital -based treatment): Location of bleed; i.e., joint, menorrhagia, epistaxis, gastrointestinal, soft tissue, muscle, body cavit y, intracranial, etc. Type of bleed; i.e., spontaneous, traumatic, unknown Severity of bleed; i.e., minor, moderate, and major (see Table 3) Date and time of onset of bleed Date and time of each infusion of rVWF (vonicog alfa) or rVWF (vonicog alfa) - ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) used to treat a bleeding episode Date and time of resolution of the bleeding episode Study site personnel are qualified after they have undergone training during the qualification of the site. All ty pes of bleeds, including traumatic bleeds, will be recorded. Bleeding episodes should be organized by where they occur in addition to whether they occurred spontaneously or due to a traumatic event . Bleeds occurring at the same anatomical location (e.g., right knee) with the same etiology (i.e., spontaneous versus injury ) within 24 hours after onset of the first bleed will be considered a single bleed. Bleeding occurring at multiple locations related to the same injury (e.g., knee and ankle bleeds following a fall) will be counted as a single bleeding episode. All efforts should be made to use rVWF (vonicog alfa) for treatment of bleeding episodes. If needed, t he use of a VWF concentrate other than IP for the treatment of bleeding episodes will not disqualify the subject from further participation in the study . For non-commercial use only"

An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom (e.g., rash, pain, discomfort, fever, dizziness, etc.), disease (e.g., peritonitis, bacteremia, etc.), or outcome of death temporally associated with the use of an IP, whether or not considered causall y related to the I P. 12.1.1.1 Serious Adverse Event AnSAE is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that ,at an y dose, meets one or more of the following criteria: Outcome is fatal/results in death (including fetal death) Is life -threatening – defined as an event in which the subject was, in the judgment of the investigator, at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that h ypotheticall y might ha ve caused death had it been more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization –inpatient hospitalization refers to any inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay . Results in persistent or sign ificant disability /incapacity (i.e., a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect Is a medicall y important event –a medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or resu lt in death or require hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definitions above. Examples of such events are (including but not limited to) : Intensi ve treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood d yscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependence or drug abuse Reviewed and confirmed seroconversion for HIV, hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), or parvovirus B19 (B19V) For non-commercial use only"

However, when there is an increa se in the severit y, duration, or frequency of a preexisting disease, the event must be described as “worsening” of the pre- existing condition on the AE CRF. 12.1.2 Assessment of Adverse Events For the purposes of this study , the following will not be considered as AEs and will not be included in the analy sis of AEs. Bleeding episodes are part of the underl ying disease and therefore are not AEs; they will be evaluated in the context of efficacy . For non -serious bleeding episode scaused b y an injury, the injury wou ld not be reported as an AE, unless it resulted in a medical finding other than a bleeding episode (e.g., abrasion of skin). Therefore, any VWD -related bleeding event (e.g., epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, musculo -skeletal bleeding, menorrhagia) thatis non -serious will not be reported as an AE. However, the investigator may decide that the event is an AE if the event also would have occurred in a healthy individual under the same circumstances.  For serious bleeding episodes (bleeding SAEs): Bleeding events that meet seriousness criteria (death, life -threatening, hospitalizing/prolongation of hospitalization, disability , congenital anomal y, or medically significant andif not urgentl y treated would result in one of the above) should be captured on the SAE eCRF and reported as a n SAE to the Sponsor or designee (e.g., CRO) on an SAE Report form as described in Section 12.1.2.3 (Safet y Reporting) . Seroconversion after documented HAV/HBV vaccination prior to or during the study period.

Each AE will be evaluated b y the investigator for: Seriousness as defined in Section 12.1.1.1 Severity as defined in Section 12.1.2.1 Causal relationship to I P exposure or study procedure as defined in Section 12.1.2.2 For each AE, the outcome (i.e., recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved, recovered/resolved with sequelae, not recovered/not resolved, fatal, unknown) and if applicable , action taken with regards to the stud y treatment (i.e., dose increased, dose not changed, dose reduced, drug interrupted, drug withdrawn, not applicable, or unknown) will also be recorded on the AE CRF. Recovering/resolving AEs will be followed until resolution or until the subject’s condition returns to the level at the baseline for pr e- existing conditions . If the severity rating for an ongoing AE changes before the event resolves, the original AE report will be revised (i.e., the event will not be reported as separate AE). During the course of an y AE, the highest severit y rating will be reported. Deviations from the protocol-specified dosage (including underdosing /overdosing [<20IU/kg rVWF:RCo or >100 rVWF:RCo], abuse, and withdrawal, treatment errors (including incorrect route of administration, use of an incorrect product, and devi ations from the protocol -defined dosing schedule), failures of expected pharmacological actions, and unexpected therapeutic or clinical benefits will be followed with regard to occurrence of AEs, lack of efficacy , and/or other observations because these ev ents may be reportable to regulatory authorities. Any pregnancy that occurs after administration of IP will be reported on a Pregnancy Form and followed- up at 1 y ear post- delivery , if feasible.

These severity definitions will also be used to assess the severity of an AE with a study- related procedure(s), if necessary . 12.1.2.2 Causality Causality is a determ ination of whether there is a reasonable possibility that the I P is etiologicall y related to/associated with the AE. Causality assessment includes, e.g., assessment of temporal relationships, dechallenge/rechallenge information, association (or lack of association) with underly ing disease, presence (or absence) of a more likely cause, and ph ysiological plausibility . For each AE, the investigator will assess the causal relationship between the IP and the AE using his/her clinical expertise and judgment accor ding to the following most appropriate algorithm for the circumstances of the AE: Not related (both circumstances must be met) Is due to underl ying or concurrent illness, complications, concurrent treatments, or effects of concurrent drugs For non-commercial use only"

In addition, relevant critical safet y laboratory tests for c omplete blood count ( CBC ), serum chemistry and/or coagulation parameters such as VWF and FVIII activity may also be performed in the local laboratory to ensure that results will be available immediately to the investigator. In principle, results from the c entral laboratory will be used for data analysis purposes. The assay s performed in the central laboratories are specified in the Laboratory Manual. The investigator will supply the sponsor with a list of the normal ranges and units of measurement for the l aboratory variables to be determined at the site. Laboratory values such as antibodies to other proteins are not required immediately and will be assessed later during the course of the study. Any abnormal laboratory value that is considered clinically significant b y the investigator based on a local laboratory test result (reference range and the units to be provided) should be confirmed b y a central laboratory test result for which the sample is drawn/collected within 24 hours of the abnormal finding b y the local laboratory. 12.9.1 rVWF Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Details on pharmacokinetic and pharmacod ynamics assessments are provided in Section 11.6. 12.9.2 Hematology and Clinical Chemistry The hematology panel will consist of CBC [hemoglobin, hematocrit, ery throcy tes (ie, red blood cell count [RBC] ; mean corpuscular volume [MCV ], mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration [MCHC]), and leukocytes (i.e., white blood cell count [WBC])] with differential (i.e., basophils, eosinophils, lymphocy tes, monocy tes, neutrophils) and platelet counts. The clinical chemistry panel will consist of sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), ALT, lactate dehy drogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (AP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), CR, and glucose (Glu).

Hematology and clinical chemistry assessments will be performed on Ethy lenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA )-anticoagulated whole blood and serum, respectivel y, at the central laboratory. 12.9.3 Immunology 12.9.3.1 Antibodies to VWF and FVIII All subje cts will be tested for binding and neutralizing antibodies to VWF and FVIII at screening, at initial PK assessment, at each of the scheduled follow -up visits and at the study completion visit. Testing will be done prior to I P infusion and with at least a 72hour wash out period since the last I P infusion. If there is any suspicion of inhibitor development (e.g. excessive bleeding) binding and neutralizing antibodies to VWF and FVIII may be tested at the discretion of the investigator. 12.9.3.2 Neutralizing and Tota l Binding Anti -VWF Antibodies The assay s to establish the presence of neutralizing and total binding anti -VWF antibodies have been established in the absence of international standards and with only limited numbers of positive controls. Therefore, caution is advised in interpreting positive results. I n particular, any clinical association, changes in the natural history of the disease, effect of therapy, etc. needs to be taken into account for final judgment. Thesponsor’s Medical Director should be consult ed for additional advice. As part of the AE follow -up, an y sample testing positive needs to be confirmed after 2 -4 weeks for central laboratory testing. Only confirmed neutralizing anti -VWF antibodies are considered inhibitors (see Section 12.9.3.4). These subjects need to be closely monitored and therap y adjusted accordingl y. 12.9.3.3 Binding antibodies to VWF The presence of total binding anti -VWF antibo dies will be determined b y an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) employ ing poly clonal anti -human Immunoglobulin (Ig)antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA). For this assay (ELI SA), recombinant human VWF will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then incubated with dilutions of the positive control, the negative control or test sample. Antibodies against human VWF that are present in the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled goat anti- human antibody (secondary antibody ). The positive control for this assay will be a human monoclonal antibody specific for human VWF spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human plasma.

First, the sample is screened for antibodies and the titer of binding antibodies is determined. Second, the specificit y of positive antibody results is confirmed.16 Inbrief, all samples are serially diluted (initial dilution 1:20 and further diluted 1:2). Thetiter endpoint, defined as the highest dilution that still gives a positive signal above cut off level, is determined in two independent duplicates. The cut off level is established based on background signal level of healthy plasma donors ( n=160) and set to include 5% false positives to be as sensitive as possible (95% percentile). The ELISA assay is validated allowing a nassay variability of ± 1 titer step. Therefore, differences ≤ 2 titers steps may be due to variability of the ELISA assay . Specificity has to be confirmed in a competition assay when a sample has a titer of 1:80 or higher in the screening assay . Based on the validation criteria samples tested in the screening assay at 1:20 or 1:40 cannot be confirmed in the competition assay . A positive screening value is confirmed if the difference between the titers determined for the subject sample (re -screen) and for the subject sample with pre -incubation (confirmation sample) is > 2 titer steps. Antibody titers of subject samples will only be reported as positive, if the results of the screening and confirmatory anal ysis fulfill these acceptance criteria. The titer to be reported is alway s the one determined in the original screening procedure (independent of the result of the re -screenin g in the confirmation procedure). A more detailed test procedure will be supplied upon request or pro -actively if a sample tests positive. A treatment related increase of the binding anti -VWF antibodies is expected, if the titer increases b y more than 2 t itration steps. These subjects need to be closely monitored and therapy adjusted accordingly . 12.9.3.4 Neutralizing Antibodies to VWF Three functional VWF assay s, VWF:CB, VWF:RCo and VWF:FVIIIB assay s, will be used to test for the presence of neutralizing anti -VWF antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies to VWF:RCo, VWF:CB and VWF:FVIIIB activities will be measured b y assay s based on the Bethesda assay established for quantitative analy sis of FVIII inhibitors (Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay ).17The amount of inhibitor is expressed as BU per mL. One BU is thereb y defined as the amount of inhibitor that decreases the measured activity in the assay s to 50% of that of the negative control samples. The assay s were validated using human plasma samples from two type 3 VWD patients with low (1-2BU/mL) and high (~10 BU/mL) titer inhibitors and plasma samples from non-human primates immunized with human rVWF (vonicog alfa) (>100 BU/mL) .

Howe ver, if baseline levels are too high (>15% VWF:RCo), inhibitors may not be reliabl y detected. To exclude false positive results, the detection limit for anti-VWF inhibitors was set to 1BU/ml for all 3 assay s. The rationale for this cut -off value is the relativel y high CIof the underl ying assay s, making determinations at the end of the evaluation range of the Bethesda reference curve uncertain.18A more detailed test procedure may be requested to further characterize the a nti-VWF inhibitors, if detected. Only confirmed positive anti-VWF inhibitor test result will be reported and will be considered as a medically significant SAE. 12.9.3.5 Binding Antibodies to FVIII Binding antibodies against FVIII will be anal yzed using a proprietary enzyme immunoassay . The testing strategy will be as described for binding anti -VWF antibodies. Antibody -containing samples will be identified in a screening assay followed by a confirmat ory assay to exclude false positive results. 12.9.3.6 Neutralizing Antibodies (Inhibitors) to FVIII Neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to FVIII will be assessed b y the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay in a central laboratory . To verify a FVIII inhibit or, additional testing (such as tests for L upus anticoagulants) may be initiated. Positive FVIII inhibitor tests will be defined as ≥ 0.4 BU b y the Nijmegen -modified Bethesda assay that is confirmed b y a second test performed on an independent sample obtai ned 2 -4 weeks following the first test.

The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human plasma. 12.9.4.2 Anti -Murine IgG A commerciall y available ELI SA (Medac, Hamburg, Germany ) will be used to detect and to quantify IgG antibodies originating from human plasma that are directed against mouse -IgG (HAMA: human anti -mouse antibodies). M icrotiter p lates coated with mouse IgG will be incubated with dilutions of the standard, the positive control, the negative control or the test sample. Antibodies against mouse IgG that are present in thesamples bind to the coated antigen and form a bridge to a pero xidase coupled mouse IgGantibody that will be used for detection (bridging format of the ELISA assay ). Thepositive control for this assay will be a poly clonal goat anti-murine IgG spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human plasma. 12.9.4.3 Antibodies to Human Furin Total Ig antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM) against human Furin will be anal yzed.

Results from multimer analy sis (see Section 12.9.10.1) may contribute to VWD gene mutational analysis. The genetic testing will be done, when the subject consents to the genetic testing. 12.9.9 Blood Group Analysis The blood group needs to be determined during the screening period.

In vitro and in vivo cleavage of these ultralarge molecular fractions by ADAMTS13 and generation of characteristic satellite bands has been extensively demonstrated during nonclinical and clinical development. Nevertheless, the potential elevated risk of thrombosis and/or other thromboembolic complications due to the administration of ultra large molecular VWF multimers in subjects with normal levels of VWF cannot be complet ely excluded. Therefore VWF multimer anal ysis will not only be performed routinel y at screening but in case of thromboembolic events ,both VWF multimer anal ysis as well as ADAMTS13 activity will be determined to assess an y relatedness of these occurrences with I P treatment. 12.9.10.1 VWF Multimer Analysis The VWF multimer pattern will be assessed using low- resolution sodium dodecy l sulfate (SDS) –agarose gel electrophoresis. High -resolution SDS –agarose gel electrophoresis, with agarose concentrations 1.5%, will be used to determine the satellite band structure of VWF. These anal yses will employ Western blot with luminescence video imaging. 12.9.10.2 ADAMTS13 Activity VWF73 was identified as the 73 amino acid minimal region of the VWF A2 domain required for ADAMTS13 cleavage. The cleavage of this substrate will be detected b y a commerciall y available ELISA -based Chromogenic assay (Technoclone Austria): Cleavage of immobilized VWF73 substrate is detected b y a HRP -labeled antibody directed against the cleavage site of VWF73. The amount of bound antibody, which is the function of the ADAMTS13 cleavage is detected by a chromogenic substrate. 12.9.11 Soluble P -Selectin (sP -Selectin) sP-selectin is a cell adhesion molecule (CAM) found in granules in endothelial cells (cells lining blood vessels) and activated platelets. Data for an association between the sP-selectin concentration, TTP and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are limited and the predictive value has not y et established. A commercial ELISA assay will be employ ed as an exploratory test. sP -selectin will be determined at the Screening visit and used as indicator for an increased thrombotic risk.

While a negative result practically rules out thrombosis, a positive result can indicate thrombosis but does not rule out other potential etiologies, including a recent hemorrhage. Its main use, therefore, is to exclude thromboembolic disease where the probability is low. D -Dimer will be measured at the Screening visit and used as indicator for an increased thrombotic risk. 12.9.13 Additional Laboratory Testing in Case of Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions If a subject develops a severe hypersensitivity reaction in the course of the clinical study ,additional blood will be drawn for anti -VWF IgE antibod y testing. The presence of anti-VWF IgE will be determined by using the ImmunoCAP®, a VWF -specific IgE blood test (Thermo Scientific). The basis of the ImmunoCAP® technology isa cellulose polymer as solid phase in a plastic capsule providing a large surface for protein binding. rVWF (vonicog alfa) as antigen is covalently coupled to the cellulose polymer. Detection of specific anti -VWF IgE bound to the antigen will be accomplished by a secondary enzy me-labeled anti-human IgE antibody . Testing for binding anti -human VWF IgE antibodies will be done with 0.5 mL plasma. Antibody containing samples will be identified and quantified in a screening assay followed by a confirmatory assay to exclude false positive result s. 12.9.14 Assessment of Laboratory Values 12.9.14.1 Assessment of Abnormal Laboratory Values For VWF and FVIII laboratory assessments no evaluation of clinical significance is necessary . Each other laboratory value (except results to determine genetics of the underly ing VWD disease and blood group) has to be assessed b y the investigator and the assessment will be recorded on the eCRF. The investigator will determine for each abnormal laboratory value whether the value is considered clinically significant or not and provid e the reference range including the units . For clinicall y significant values, the investigator will indicate if the value constitutes a new AE (see definition in Section 12.1) and record the sign, s ymptom, or medical diagnosis on the AE CRF, is a sy mptom or related to a previously recorded AE, is due to a pre -existing disease (described in Section 12.1.1.5), or is due to another issue that will be specified.

No formal statistical hypothesis test is planned for the analy sis. The primary efficacy anal ysis will be ba sed on the FAS and will be summarized by the two cohorts: on -demand and switch subjects .As a supportive anal ysis, the same anal ysis will also be carried out on the PP analy sis set. The spontaneous ABR while treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa) for each cohort will be estimated using a negative binomial regression.

Actual sampling times will be defined as time from the start of infusion t o the blood sample collection time. A deviation from the protocol - specified blood sample drawing time window will not be a reason to exclude an observation from the analysis. Samples with unknown actual and planned collection date/time or where the concentration could not be determined, or where results were biological lyimplausible will be eliminated from the anal ysis.

Dosage may be individualized w ithin this range based on: available historical PK data type and severity of bleeding episodes the subject has experienced in the past monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory measures The starting dose can, after consultation with the Sponsor, be increased up to 80U/kg if considered necessary to assure effective prophylaxis. Subjects switching from pdVWF prophylaxis treatment: the w eekly dose (IU/kg) of rVWF (vonicog alfa) for each patient will be equivalent (± 10%) to the w eekly VWF dose received during prophylactic treatment with pdVWF. The w eekly dose should be divided int o 2 infusions, with a maximum of 80 IU/kg/infusion. If needed, based on the total w eekly dose or other clinical judgements, the weekly dose may be given as three infusions. A once weekly dose regimen will be allow ed after switch to rVWF (vonicog alfa) if t he patient has been on a once weekly dose regimen with pdVWF. Dose and dose interval may, after consultation with the sponsor, be further individualized based on: available historical PK data type and severity of bleeding episodes the subject has experienced in the past monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory measures Treatment of Bleeding Episodes: Dosage must be individualized based on the subject’s weight, type and severity of bleeding episode and monitoring of appropriate clinical and laboratory measures. In general, an initial dose of 40 -60 IU/kg VWF:RCo w ithor without 30-45 IU rFVIII [ADVATE , octocog alfa ]/kg is recommended (rVWF:rFVIII ratio of 1.3:1: ± 0.2). In cases of major bleeding episodes, a dose of up to 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo may be infused. Subsequent doses, if necessary, will be administered with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) to maintain VWF:RCo and FVIII levels for as long as deemed necessary by the investigator.

The aim is to have ≥8subjects in each cohort (OD and switch). A total of at least five type 3 VWD subjects will be followed for 12 months. The sample size is driven by practical considerations (primarily the enrollment of a rare patient population) and EMA Guideline on the Cli nical Investigation of Human Plasma Derived von Willebrand Factor Products (CPMP/BPWG/220/02).1 Planned Statistical Analysis The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will be composed of all subjects who receive prophylaxis IP treatment. The Safety Analysis Set will be composed of all subjects who received any amount of IP (rVWF, vonicog alpha ). The Per -Protocol (PP) Analysis Set will be composed of subjects who are at least 70% compliant regarding the nu mber of scheduled prophylactic infusions. Only subjects who meet all study entry criteria and who have no major protocol violations that might impact primary efficacy assessments will be included in the PP analysis set. The Pharmacokinetic Full Analysis Se t (PKFAS) will be composed of all subjects who received the PK infusion and who provided acceptable data for PK and PD analysis. Acceptable PK/PD data w ill be defined in the Statistical Analysis Plan. Primary Outcome Measure: No formal statistical hypothes is test is planned for the analysis. Spontaneous ABR while treated w ith rVWF (vonicog alfa) for each cohort, on demand and switch subjects, will be estimated using a negative binomial regression. The prior ABR for each cohort w ill be based on historical da ta collected from each enrolled subject. The tw o ABRs (observed on the study and historical) w ill be assessed using a generalized linear mixed -effects model (GLMM) w ith the negative binomial distribution as a family and with a logarithmic link function (th e default). The ABR ratio together with a two -sided, 95% confidence interval (CI) will be reported for each cohort. The difference in on -study ABR relative to historical ABR will be summarized descriptively. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the FAS and will be summarized by the two cohorts: on - demand and switch subjects. As a supportive analysis, the same analysis will also be carried out on the per - PP analysis set. Secondary Outcome Measures: In general, data for secondary efficacy analysi s will be summarized by the two cohorts: on -demand and switch subjects and when applicable overall. Mean, standard deviation, median, range, quartiles will be calculated for continuous endpoints. Proportions will be calculated for categorical endpoints. Co nfidence intervals at the 95% level will be provided w hen appropriate. For non-commercial use only"

The number and proportion of pdVWF switch subjects with ABR preservation success will be reported together with the corresponding 95% tw o-sided CIs for the proportion. The number and proportion of subjects with categorized spontaneous ABR (i.e. 0, 1 -2, 3- 5, more than 5bleeds) will be reported descriptively. Summary statistics for the total number of infusions, as well as average number of infusions per w eek will be provided. The total w eight adjusted consumption of rVWF (vonicog alfa) during prophylactic treatment will be provided. If applicable, historical d ata on consumption of pdVWF prior to the study will be summarized as well. The change in spontaneous ABR from the historical rate to that during the rVWF (vonicog alfa) prophylaxis period will be summarized by location of bleeding (GI, epistaxis, joint bleeding, menorrhagia, oral and other mucosa, muscle and soft tissue, etc.). Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD): The follow ing PK parameters, based on the initial PK assessment after a washout for on -demand subjects, will be listed and summari zed descriptively for VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag and VWF:CB: IR, T 1/2, MRT, AUC 0-, AUC 0-tlast, Cmax, Tmax, V ss, and CL. The corresponding pharmacodynamics (PD) of rVWF (vonicog alfa) as measured in FVIII activity (FVIII:C), based on the initial PK assessment after a washout for on -demand subjects will be assessed using C max, Tmax, and AUC 0-tlast. These PD parameters willbe listed and summarized descriptively. PK parameters at steady state (AUC 0-tau;ss , Cmax;ss, Tmax;ss, and C min;ss) for the partial dosing interval will be listed for on -demand subjects at the end of the study and for switch subjects shortly after reaching steady state and at the end of the study for VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag and VWF:CB and summarized descriptively for subjects with the same dosing regimens. T he corresponding pharmacodynamics (PD) of rVWF (vonicog alfa) as measured in FVIII activity (FVIII:C) will be assessed using AUC 0-tau;ss, Cmax;ss, Tmax;ss, and C min;ss. These PD parameters will be listed for on -demand subjects at the end of the study and f or switch subjects shortly after reaching steady state and at the end of the study and will be summarized descriptively for subjects with the same dosing regimens. For the on -demand subjects, the PK of VWF:RCo w ill be analyzed using a population PK approa ch to characterize the single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics, including associated variability, of VWF:RCo in the study population. For the switch subjects, differences in AUC 0-tau;ss , Cmax;ss, and C min;ss assesses shortly after reaching steady state and assessed at the end of the study will be assessed by ratio of geometric means and corresponding two -sided 95% confidence intervals for VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, VWF:CB, and FVIII:C.

For all subjects activity/concentration vs. time curves will be prepared. Safety: Safety analysis will be performed overall and by the two cohorts: on -demand and switch subjects. Treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs wi th start dates on or after the first exposure to IP. Summaries of AEs will be based on TEAEs unless otherwise indicated. Occurrence of AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) will be summarized descriptively, by system organ class and preferred term. The number and per centage of subjects who experienced AEs and SAEs, and the number of AEs and SAEs will be tabulated. In addition, the number of subjects who experienced AEs assessed as related to IP by the investigator, and the number of IP -related AEs will be tabulated. The number of patients with AEs by severity will be presented similarly. A listing of all AEs will be presented by subject identifier, age, sex, preferred term and reported term of the AE, duration, severity, seriousness, action taken, outcome, causality as sessment by investigator, onset date, stop date and medication or non -drug therapy to treat the AE. Temporally associated AEs are defined as AEs that begin during infusion or within 24 hours (or 1 day where time of onset is not available) after completion of infusion, irrespective of being related or not related to treatment. Temporally associated AEs will be presented in summary tables. Adverse events of special interest (AESI), such as hypersensitivity reactions and thromboembolic events, will be monito red throughout the study and statistical analysis will be conducted based on the search criteria (eg, standardized MedDRA queries [SMQ]) determined prior to database lock, and summarized. For immunogenicity analysis frequency counts and proportions will be calculated for subjects with the occurrence of neutralizing (inhibitory) antibodies to VWF and FVIII, occurrence of binding antibodies to VWF and FVIII, and occurrence of binding antibodies to CHO proteins, mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) and rFurin. Clinica lly significant changes relative to baseline in vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters (hematology, clinical chemistry) will be reported. For non-commercial use only"

(hereafter referred to as Baxalta or sponsor) has developed a human recombinant von Willebrand Factor (rVWF , vonicog alpha ), which is co -expressed with recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line and separated during the su bsequent downstream process. To address concerns regarding the risk of transmission of blood- borne pathogens that may be introduced by human plasma, no exogenousl y added raw materials of human or animal origin are employed in the cell culture, purification , or formulation of the final container product. The only proteins present in the final container product other than rVWF (vonicog alfa) are trace quantities of murine immunoglobulin (IgG, from the immunoaffinity purification), host cell (i.e., CHO) protei n, rFurin (used to further process rVWF). rVWF (vonicog alfa) is intended for the treatment of von Willebrand disease (VWD). rVWF (vonicog alfa) has been developed under the Baxalta internal code BAX111 and is used as investigational product (I P) in this study . rVWF (vonicog alfa) may be used with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) for the treatment of bleeding episodes (see Section 8.6.4.4). S ee Section 8.6for further information on the I Ps and their usage in this study . A detailed description of rVWF (vonicog alfa) is also provided in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). rVWF (vonicog alfa) was granted licensure in the United States in December 2015 under the brand name VONVENDI for the on- demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes in adults diagnosed with VWD and it has been availab le on the market in the US since 09 August 2016. In April 2018, VONVENDI was also granted licensure in the US by the FDA for an additional indication of perioperative management of bleeding in adults (age 18 and older) diagnosed with VWD. On 31st of August 2018, European Commission implemented the decision granting marketing authorization for VEYVONDI (vonicog alfa) for the treatment of haemorrhage and surgical bleeding and for the prevention of surgical bleeding in adults (age 18 and older) diagnosed with VWD, when desmopressin (DDAVP) treatment alone is ineffective or not indicated. VEYVONDI should not be used in the treatment of Haemophilia A. On 4 October 2018, VEYVONDI (vonicog alfa) was granted licensure in Switzerland by Swissmedic for the treatment of haemorrhage or surgical bleeding in VWD, when desmopressin (DDAVP )treatment alone is ineffective or contra -indicated. VEYVONDI should not be used in the treat ment of Haemophilia A. On 10 January 2019, V ONVENDI was authorized in Canada for the treatment and c ontrol of bleeding episodes , and p erioperative management of bleeding in adults (age ≥18) diagnosed with VWD.

VWF is normally found in plasma and produced in the alpha -granules of platelets and in endothelial cell organelles known astheWeibel -Palade bodies. VWF mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites ofvascular injury , one of the key functions in primary hemostasis. VWF also serves to stabilize coagulation factor VIII (FVIII), where FVIII is an essential cofactor of secondary hemostasis, which l eads to fibrin clot formation.2Qualitative and/or quantitative deficiencies of VWF le ad to a highl y variable bleeding diathesis known as VWD, the most common of the hereditary coagulation factor deficiencies. Penetrance of VWD is highly variable, with only a small fraction of mildly affected patients display ing clinical sy mptoms or a famil y history of a bleeding diathesis. The current biochemical -based classification distinguishes disorders arising from partial quantitative (ty pe 1), qualitative (ty pe 2), or virtually complete (t ype 3) deficiencies of VWF. Up to 70% of VWD patients are diagnosed with ty pe 1 VWD, which may also be associated with minor functional defects in the molecule. In general, patients with ty pe 1 VWD display mild clinical sy mptoms. Approximately 20 to 30% of VWD patients are diagnosed with ty pe 2 VWD. Ty pe 2 VWD is further divided into 4 subty pes (A, B, N, and M), reflecting distinct classes of functional abnormalities. These defects result in abnormal functional and/or multimeric distribution patterns that facilitate their diagnosis. The bleeding diathesis is usual ly moderate and primarily affects the mucosal tissues. Type 2N VWD patients are sometimes misdiagnosed as mild hemophilia A. Finally , approximately 1% percent of VWD patients exhibit a total or near total absence of VWF, which is classified as t ype 3 VWD. The incidence of ty pe 3 VWD is estimated at 0.5-1.0 x 106. This ty pe is also associated with a very low FVIII level (t ypically <5%) because the VWF carrier function for FVIII is lost. Replacement of VWF alone stabilizes endogenous FVIII, resulting in hemos tatic levels within several hours post- infusion. Published results from studies of a plasma- derived VWF (pdVWF) concentrate demonstrated an increase of FVIII at an approximate rate of 5.8 1 IU dL-1h-1.3Type 3 VWD patients display severe hemorrhagic s ymptoms with bleeding predominantly in mucosal tissues, muscle and joints. All VWD patients, particularl y those with ty pe 2 or type 3 VWD, are at an increased risk for life- threatening bleeding episodes. For non-commercial use only"

A Swedish cohort including 37 patients with t ype 3 VWD under proph ylactic median treatment of 11 years (range 2 to 45 years) was retrospectivel y anal yzed.6,7The doses used for proph ylaxis, given once weekly for at least 45 weeks per y ear, were calculated based on 12 to 50 IU/kg bod y weight (BW) of FVIII clotting activity (FVIII:C) which approximately corresponded to 24 -100 IU/kg v on Willebrand factor: Ristocetin cofactor activity (VWF:RCo) considering that mainly Haemate with a known VWF:RCo/FVIII:C ratio of about 2 was used. An escalation of doses from 1to 3dose levels was allowed depending on the frequency and severit y of bleeding episodes. Theresults demonstrate that under long -term prophy laxis the number of bleeds could be reduced dramatically . Whereas the median value for bleeds per y ear was about 10 before prophy laxis this value could be reduced to less tha n 1 bleed per year during prophy laxis. The benefit of proph ylaxis for such indications was retrospectivel y also demonstrated in a cohort of Italian patients including type 3, 2A, 2M and type 1 patients. Prophylaxis was started after severe gastrointestinal or joint bleeding episodes and completely prevented bleeding episodes in 8 of these 11 patients and largel y reduced the need of blood transfusions in the remaining 3. A regimen of 40 IU rVWF:RCo/kg was applied every other day or twice a week. A prospectiv e stud y on prophylaxis, the PRO.WILL stud y, has been initiated in I taly.8 The results of a prospective stud y investigating the proph ylaxis in children and y oung adults showed a significantly reduced bleeding frequency and bleeding score (3 vs. 0.07; 3 vs. 0. p<0.001) compared to the pre -prophy laxis values. The median dose was 40(20-47) IU/kg VWF:RCo administer ed mainly twice weekly in 23 patients, 3 times a week in 7 patients and 4times a week in 2 children.9 The VWD Prophy laxis Network initiated the VWD International Proph ylaxis (VI P) trial to investigate the role of prophy laxis in patients with severe VWD including Ty pe 1, 2 , and 3. The dose of the factor replacement product was 50 IU /kgVWF: RCo. For non-commercial use only"

For the treatment of menorrhagia the dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo was given on the first day of menses for 2 cy cles. The frequency could be increased to Day 1 and 2 for 2 cy cles or to Day 1, 2, and 3 of menses. The study contains both retrospe ctive and prospective study components. Results from the retrospective study component were published, including 61 subjects on prophy lactic regimen in the past 6 months prior to enrollment or subjects with a history of prophy laxis over at least 6 month .10Differences in annualized bleeding rates (ABR) within individuals (during prophylaxis – before proph ylaxis) were significant for those with primary indications of epistaxis (P = 0.0005), joint bleeding ( P = 0.002) and GI bleeding (P = 0.001). The difference in the group whose primary indication for treatment was abnormally heavy bleeding at menstruation (n = 4) was not significant (P = 0.25). The reduction of mucosal bleeding likel y not onl y dependents on normal circulating levels of active VWF, but also on the presence of discrete concentrations of normal VWF inside the platelets and within endothelial matrices. The low subject number (n=4) and the treatment scheme for menorrhagia on Day s 1, 2, and 3 of m enses which might represent rather on -demand than prophy lactic treatment may also account for the outcome in this study . Results from the prospective study component were reported recentl y.11Eleven subjects completed the study . Six subjects had ty pe 2A, and 5 subjects had ty pe 3 VWD. Sixsubjects presente d with epistaxis, 3 with GI bleeding, and 2 with joint bleeding. Seven subjects had dose escalation above the first level. Among the 10 subjects with evaluable bleeding log data, the use of proph ylaxis decreased the median ABR from 25 to 6.1 (95% confidenc e interval [CI ] of the rate difference: -51.6 to - 1.7), and the median ABR was even lower (4.0; 95% CI : -57.5 to - 5.3) when the subjects reached their final dosing level. The authors concluded that this was the first prospective study to demonstrate that p rophylaxis with VWF concentrates is highl y effective in reducing mucosal and joint bleeding rates in clinicall y severe VWD. The results of the VI P study and previous investigations suggest that VWD patients with recurrent bleeding episodes and severe menor rhagia will benefit from a prophy lactic VWF replacement therapy . There is evidence that up to 40% of patients with ty pe 3 VWD experience joint bleeding which can lead to hemophilic arthropath y. Other potential indications for prophy laxis include patients w ith ty pe 2A or 2B VWD with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding, menorrhagia or frequent epistaxis.4Long-term prophy laxis for most patients with ty pe 3 VWD and in some patients with type 1 or 2VWD, depending on the pattern of bleeding, may be the treatment option of choice.

Two cohorts of patients will be included: patients currently receiving on-demand VWF treatment (OD subjects) and patients currentl y on prophylactic treatment with pdVWF (pdVWF switch subjects), and the aim is to have ≥8 subjects in each of the 2 cohorts, with a total of at least 5 ty pe 3 VWD subjects followed for 12 months. Enrolled subjects (i.e., subjects who have signed the informed consent form) will be eligible to participate in the study if they meet all of the in clusion criteria (see Section 9.1) and none of the exclusion criteria (see Section 9.2). 6.5Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies The following summarizes the key findings from relevant nonclinical studies as well as from the completed clinical studies 070701 (Phase 1 pharmacokinetics [P K] and safet y in VWD), 071001 (Phase 3 safet y and efficacy in the treatment of bleeding episodes in VWD), 071101 (Phase 3 efficacy and safety in VWD subjects undergo elective surgical procedures), 071104 (Phase 1 safety and PK in hemophilia A), and 071401 (Phase 3, expanded access in a single subject with VWD). Potential risks and efficacy of rVWF (vonicog alfa):ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) are summarized in the following sections. For additional information on nonclinical and clinical Phase 1 results ref er to the rVWF (vonicog alfa) IB. 6.5.1 Findings from Nonclinical Studies 6.5.1.1 Primary Pharmacodynamics Efficacy of rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was shown in VWD animal models, which have also low endogenous FVIII levels. Time to occlusion and stable thrombus formation was assessed in the carotid occlusion model in VWD mice. The results demonstrated that rVWF (vonicog alfa) in combination with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) acted efficientl y in a dose -dependent manner and had higher e fficacy than rVWF (vonicog alfa) alone or plasma derived (pd)VWF. These results were confirmed in an additional study assessing blood loss and survival in a tail tip bleeding model in VWD mice.

Safety pharmacology studies in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits ,and dogs revealed no risks for anaph ylactoid and thrombogenic potential of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in combination with rVWF (voni cog alfa). All observations in safety pharmacology studies are considered to lie within the biological variability of animal models or occurred due to known species - specific anaph ylactoid effects of excipients. 6.5.1.3 Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies of b oth rVWF (vonicog alfa) alone and combined with human rFVIII (rVWF+ADVATE) were conducted in VWD mice, VWD dogs, VWD pigs, rats , and cy nomolgus monkeys. Human rVWF (vonicog alfa) stabilized the endogenous FVIII in VWD mice, VWD pigs ,and VWD dogs. Furtherm ore, the h ypotheses that the area under the curve (AUC) with rVWF alone and rVWF+ADVATE is not inferior to the AUC with pdVWF (Haemate P) was tested and confirmed statistically in normal rats. The PK characteristics of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) were n ot affected by co- administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa) in cy nomolgus monkey s. The PK data in the FVIII knock out (k.o.) mice model are inconclusive and might not be relevant for the clinical situation. However, a stabilizing effect of VWF on FVIII could b e shown in a double k.o. model in a dose dependent manner. 6.5.1.4 Toxicology Single dose toxicity studies were conducted in C57BL/6J -mice, VWD mice, rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkeys. Rats, rabbits, and cy nomolgus monkey s showed no signs of toxicity . Signs of microthrombosis, an exaggerated pharmacological effect, were observed in mice. Mice are not capable of sufficiently cleaving the rVWF (vonicog alfa) subunit as murine disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin ty pe 1 motif, number 13 (ADAMTS1 3) does not decrease the ultra -large molecular weight multimers of rVWF (vonicog alfa).13The observed symptoms of microthrombosis are interpreted as a species -specific exaggerated pharmacological effect. Studies evaluating the safet y of repeated administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa) wit h or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) (dail y over 14 days) were performed in a rodent (rat) and non -rodent (cynomolgus monkey ) species. Reversible signs of exaggerated pharmacological effects (regenerative anemia, thrombocy topenia, and treatment- related histopathologic changes in the heart, liver, and spleen) were observed in rats that were administered 1400 U VWF:RCo/kg /day + 1080 IU ADVATE/kg/day intravenousl y once daily for 14 day s.

(bolus) administration of 100 U VWF:RCo/kg rVWF (vonicog alfa) c ombined with 77 IU/kg ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) over a period of 14 day s. No adverse effects could be detected in this species. There were no signs of hemoly sis, thrombosis ,or thrombocy topenia after repeated intravenous application of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa). Therefore, 100 U VWF:RCo/kg/day rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without 77 IU/kg ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was considered the no observed adverse effect level (NOAE L) in this study, which was the highest dose tested. Anti -drug antibodies, however, were formed in both species and resulted in a significant reduction in drug exposure after 14 applications as compared to a single application. These antibodies substantially reduced the sy stemic exposure to the test substance as compared to a single dose administration. No adverse effects due to antibody formation were observed in both species. rVWF (vonicog alfa) combined with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) was well tolerated locally and no genotoxic potential wa s evident after 2 in vitro and 1 in vivo genotoxicity study . A study on the influence of co- administration of VWF and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) on the immunogenicity of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in 3different hemophilic mouse models (E17 hemophilic Balb/c mice, E17 hemophilic C57BL/6J mice ,and E17 hemophilic human F8 transgenic mice) showed that rVWF (vonicog alfa) does not negativel y impact the immunogenicit y of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in any of the three different hemophilic mouse models. 6.5.2 Findings from Clinical Studies The clinical safet y, efficacy and PK were assessed in 4 completed trials: one phase 1 study (070701)) and two phase 3 studies ( 071001 and071101) that enrolled patients with VWD; one phase 1 study ( 071104 ) that enrolled patients with hemophilia A. Details on study design, populations enrolled, and safety and efficacy outcomes of the phase 1 studies are presented in Section 6.5.2.1 and Section 6.5.2.2, the phase 3 study in Section 6.5.2.3, and the phase 3 surgery study in Section 6.5.2.4 .

Subjects in Cohort 4 received a single intravenous infusion of rVWF:ADVATE and pdVWF/ADVATE at 50 I U/kg VWF:RCo in random order. The primary endpoint was the tolerability and safety after single dose injections of rVWF:ADVATE at 2, 7.5, 20 ,and 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo for up to 30 day s after the last I P infusion. The data generated in this phase 1 study suggest that rVWF:ADVATE up to the highest investigated dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RC o is well tolerated and safe in adults with severe VWD. No thrombogenic risk or thrombotic thrombocy topenic purpura (TTP )-like syndrome was observed, and no neutralizing antibodies to VWF or FVIII were identified. There were no deaths or other serious adve rse reactions, and no infusions were interrupted or stopped due to an AE. Overall, the reported AE profile was similar between the recombinant and plasma -derived concentrates. Secondary endpoints were the PK assessment of VWF:RCo, von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag) and multimeric composition of rVWF (vonicog alfa) as well as FVIII:C at standardized time points after single injections of rVWF:ADVATE and pdVWF:FVIII. The median VWF:RCo terminal half-life (T 1/2)of rVWF (vonicog alfa) at the 50 IU/kg dose was 16 hours. T 1/2with pdVWF:FVIII at the same dose level appeared shorter at 12.58 hours, however, the limits of the 90% CI were similar (11.73 to 17.7 hours vs. 11.87 to 18.03 hours). The median T1/2of VWF:RCo were shorter with the lower investigated doses: 7.13 hours and 13.23 hours with the 7.5 IU/kg and 20 IU/kg doses, although these data were derived from a much smaller number of subjects. In consequence of the missing ADAMTS13 cleavage ,ultra-large molecular weight (ULMW) multimers are contained in the rVWF (vonicog alfa) final product. The immediate cleavage of these ultra -large multimers by ADAMTS13 upon release into the circulation could be demonstrated appl ying sodium dodecy l sulfate pol yacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS -PAGE)/I mmunoblot with polyclonal anti -VWF antibodies to detect the resulting rVWF (vonicog alfa) subunit cleavage fragments.

Primary outcome measures indicate that co -administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa) slightly sustain ADVATE activity with the highest observed ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) half -life of 13.74 h (CI 11.44 to16.52) after co- infusion of 50 IU/kg ADVATE plus 50 IU/kg rVWF:RCo. Thehighest improvement in ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) circulating half -life was observed in subjects with VWF:Ag levels below 100% which indicates an association between baseline VWF:Ag levels and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) half -life increase. No treatment related AEs or SAEs were reported. No subject withdrew due to an AE and there were no deaths. No binding antibodies to VWF, CHO ,and rFurin were detectable in the confirmatory assay and no signs of a h ypersensitivity to rVWF (vonicog alfa) or ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) antigen were observed. Laboratory values over time did not indicate an y potential safet y risk for hemophilia A patients treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa) and ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in combination. In summary , the data indicate that rVWF (vonicog alfa) co- administered with ADVATE (rFV III, octocog alfa) up to the highest dose of 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo is well tolerated and safe in hemophilia A patients.

The study consisted of 2 parts (Part A and Part B). Part A consisted of PK assessments alone (Arm 2: PK50 onl y [without treatment of bleeding episodes]), or PK assessments (Arm 1: PK50 and Arm 3: PK80) plus on- demand treatment period(s) of 6 months for bleeding episodes, or on -demand treatment for bleeding episodes only (Arm 4). Except for subjects in arm 2 who completed study after second PK assessment, subjects receiving treatment for PK assessments and/or bleeding episodes in Part A were to be entered into Part B to continue on-demand treatment for bleeding episodes for 6additional months for a total of 12 months in the study . The primary outcome measure was the number of subjects with “treatment success” (extent of control of bleeding episodes), which was defined as a mean efficacy rating score of <2.5 for a subject’s I P-treated bleeding episodes during the study . The rate of subjects with treatment success was 100% (Clopper -Pearson exact 90% CI:84.7 to 100.0) for bleeds where the assessments were made prospectivel y and excluding GI bleeds. Sensitivity anal yses confirmed the results of the primary anal ysis. Crossover results at 50 IU/kg VWF:RCo showed that the PK profile for rVWF (vonicog alfa) V WF:RCo was independent of administration alone or with rFVIII (ADVATE , octocog alpha ) (T 1/2:19.4 hours for rVWF and 16.6 hours for rVWF:rFVIII; IR: 1.8 U/dL per IU/kg infused for both rVWF and rVWF:rFVIII; mean residence time ( MRT ): 26.7 hours for rVWF and 25.2 hours for rVWF:rFVIII). FVIII levels increased substantially with a median peak at 24 hours of 111.0 U/dL for rVWF:rFVIII and 86.0 U/dL after rVWF alone, indicating that rVWF (vonicog alfa) induces a sustained increase in endogenous FVIII activity . The rVWF (vonicog alfa) PK profile was comparable at 50 IU/kg and 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo, and repeated PK at 80 IU/kg VWF:RCo showed close agreement between pretreatment and end - of-study results.

Using 50 IU/kg for PK measurements, subjects in the 071001 study exhibiting a T1/2for rVWF of 14, 16 ,or 19 hours had rVWF plasma concentrations at 72 hours after administration of 2.55, 4.01, and 6.49% above baseline, respectivel y, and plasma concentrations at 96 hours after administration of 0.78, 1.40 ,and 2.71% above baseline, respectively . In this context it should be noted that subjects in the present stud y who have significant spontaneous bleeding while on twice weekly prophy laxis will have their regimen increase dto 3 times per week based on clear criteria for different bleeding locations (for deta ils see Section 8.6.4.3.1). Subjects in the present study who are switching from prophy laxis with a pdVWF product will begin on rVWF (vonicog alfa) using their same weekl y total dose in IU/kg VWF:RCo used during their pdVWF proph ylaxis divided into twice weekly infusions (for details see section 8.6.4.3). A total of 125 AEs occurred in 25/37 (67.7%) subjects (62/318 infusions [19.5%]) during or after infusion with I P. Of these, 116/125 were non -serious (all mild or moderate; none were severe), and 9 SAEs were reported in 7 subjects. Of 125 tota l AEs, 38 were temporally associated with I P; 8 AEs were considered causally related to I P: 6 non- serious related AEs (tach ycardia, infusion site paraesthesia, electrocardiogram [ECG ] t-wave inversion, dy sgeusia, generalized pruritis, and hot flush) occurr ed in 4 subjects, and 2 related SAEs (chest discomfort and increased heart rate) occurred in 1subject. No deaths occurred during this study . None of the subjects developed anti- VWF or anti -FVIII neutralizing antibodies and no binding antibodies to VWF or rFurin, or antibodies against CHO protein or anti- Murine IgG were observed. No clinical or subclinical signs or symptoms of a thrombogenic event were observed in this study . Following an initial increase in ultralarge VWF multimers after administration of rVWF (vonicog alfa), a notable decrease in the proportion of large VWF multimers occurred between 12 and 24 hours post infusion, due to degradation by the endogenous ADAMTS13 followed by a continued decline until the end of the 96- hour follow -up period. Overall, the data support the safe and effective use of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without rFVIII (ADVATE , octocog alpha ) in the treatment of bleeds in patients with VWD.

Eleven subjects underwent a PK assessment by infusion of 50 ± 5 IU/kg rVWF:RCo at an infusion rate of up to 4 mL/min. 12 to 24 hours before surgery , subjects received a dose of 40 to 60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo. Within 3 hours prior to surgery , the subject’s FVIII:C levels were assessed with a target of 30 IU/dL for minor and oral surgeries and 60 IU/dL for major surgeries. Within 1 hour prior to surgery, subjects received a dose of rVWF (vonicog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) (depending on the target FVIII:C levels at the 3 hour assessment). VWF and FVIII IR and T 1/2for each subject, when known, were used to guide the initial dose and subsequent doses. The primary outcome measure was the overall assessment of hemostatic efficacy assessed by the investigator (hemophilia phy sician) 24 hours after last perioperative IP infusion or at completion of day 14 visit, whichever occurred earlier, and was summarized by the percen tage of subjects in each efficacy category (“excellent”, “good”, “moderate” and “none”). Point estimate and corresponding 90% two -sided exact CI was calculated for the rate of subjects with an overall assessment of hemostatic efficacy . All 15 subjects trea ted with rVWF (vonicog alfa) (with or without ADVATE) for major (10), minor (4), and oral (1) elective surgical procedures had overall hemostatic efficacy ratings of “excellent” or “good”. Most (73.3%) subjects had “excellent” overall hemostatic efficacy ratings; of these, 7 underwent major surgery and 4 underwent minor surgery . The remaining 26.7% subjects had “good” overall hemostatic efficacy ratings: 3 underwent major surgery and 1underwent oral surgery. All 8 subjects with VWD Ty pe3,the subt ype clas sified as absolute VWF deficiency, had overall hemostatic efficacy ratings of “excellent” (87.5%) or “good” (12.5%). Intraoperative hemostatic efficacy ratings were also rated as “excellent” or “good” for all 15 treated subjects. Most (86.7%) subjects had “excellent” intraoperative hemostatic efficacy ratings; of these, 8 underwent major surgery , 4 underwent minor surgery , and 1underwent oral surgery. Two (13.3%) subjects who underwent major surgery had “good” intraoperative hemostatic efficacy ratings. Intraoperative hemostatic efficacy wasrated as “excellent” or “good” for all subjects with VWD Ty pe 3: “excellent” for 7(87.5%) subjects and “good” for 1 (12.5%) subject.

The median daily postoperative weight -adjusted dose of rVWF (vonicog alfa) (with or without ADVATE) was 23.5 IU/kg on postoperative Day 1 (n=3) and 25.5 IU/kg on postoperative Day 14 (n=2). In subjects treated with rVWF:ADVATE, the daily postoper ative weight -adjusted dose was 16.9 IU/kg rVWF and 7.6 IU/kg ADVATE on postoperative Day 1 (n=1) and decreased to 50.8 IU/kg rVWF and 7.6 IU/kg ADVATE on postoperative Day 7 (n=1). For subjects treated with rVWF alone, the median weight -adjusted dose (Q1, Q3) of rVWF was 35.4 IU/kg on postoperative Day 1 (n=2) and decreased to 23.7 IU/kg on postoperative Day 7 (n=4) and 25.5 IU/kg on postoperative Day 14 (n=2). A total of 11 subjects were evaluated for PK in the study . As expected, postinfusion increases in concentrations of VWF:RCo, VWF:Ac, VWF:Ag, and VWF collagen binding ( VWF:CB ) were observed. Mean values for VWF:RCo were as follows: AUC0 -∞/dose was 37.50 hours*IU/dL per IU/kg infused; AUC0- 72h/dose was 34.08 hours*IU/dL per IU/kg infused; T1/2 was 17.83 hours; MRT was 24.32 hours; CLwas 0.03117 dL/hour/kg; and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss)was 0.6837 dL/kg. Median values for VWF:RCo were as follows: AUC0 -∞/dose was 32.94 hours*IU/dL per IU/kg infused; AUC0- 72h/dose was 31.70 hours*IU/dL per IU/kg infused; T1/2 was 14.62 hours; MRT was 21.80 hours; CL was 0.03036 dL/hour/kg; and Vss was 0.7078 dL /kg. The VWF:RCo activity was consistent with that previously observed in clinical studies 071001 and 070701. rVWF (vonicog alfa) was safe and wel l tolerated in adults with severe VWD undergoing major, minor, and oral elective surgical procedures. Of the 12 total treatment -emergent AEs ( TEAEs )that occurred during the study , 2 deep vein thrombosis events (1 non - serious and 1 serious, as a part of on e case) reported in one subject, who underwent total hip replacement surgery and who had concurrent condition of obesity , was assessed b y the sponsor as possibly causally -related to study treatment. None of the TEAEs were either a severe allergic or hy pers ensitivity reaction or developed due to a severe allergic reaction. One subject with VWD Ty pe 3 who had an intraoperative transfusion of packed red blood cells during total knee replacement surgery tested positive for binding antibodies to VWF on postoper ative Day 7 through study completion.

For the initial rVWF (v onicog alfa) infusion, the subject received a test dose of 5% of thetotal dose of 60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo at an infusion rate of 1 mL/min. After a 10 to 15-minute observation period, no adverse sy mptoms or signs were noted and the subject received the remainin g 95% of the total dose. The subject was monitored for an y signs of an allergic reaction, and none were noted. Treatment with rVWF (vonicog alfa) every 12to 24 hours was to continue at the discretion of the investigator based on VWF levels and clinical s ymptomatology . The subject had an excellent response and recovery , which allowed for daily dosing of rVWF (vonicog alfa) and, within 24 hours, the subject’s bleeding had stopped. Daily dosing of rVWF (vonicog alfa) was maintained and the subject received h is last dose on . The subject also received rVWF (vonicog alfa) for 7 days for prophy laxis for surgery (surgical resection of a left -kidney mass). The subject experienced no hemorrhagic complications and no AEs that were considered related to the use of rVWF (vonicog alfa). 6.6Evaluation of Anticipated Risks and Benefits of the Investigational Product(s) to Human Subjects Current treatment of VWD patients relies on desmopressin and VWF products manufactured from pooled human plasma. Human VWF produced b y recombinant technology could offer a new perspective in treatment of VWD. The benefit for the individual subject is anticipated to be significant during this clinical stud y. He/she may benefit from a product that minimizes excessive FVIII admin istration and thus allowing individualized dosing of VWF at optimal levels. Variations in VWF multimeric composition may lead to variability with respect to treating or preventing bleeds in VWD subjects, especially mucosal bleeds which are especiall y probl ematic. rVWF (vonicog alfa) product manufactured b y Baxalta consistently contains ULMW VWF multimers due to the fact that the product has not been exposed to ADAMTS13.

By using a recombinant product, the risk of transmission of adventitious agents and other blood -borne pathogens a ssociated with the use of products of human or animal origin has been eliminated. At this stage of product development, the key societal benefit is a better understanding of advanced treatment options for VWD and enhanced product availability .

The IP infusion for the initial PK assessment is scheduled on the baseline visit, which shoul d be within 42 day s after the completion of screening procedures and confirmation of eligibility . At the baseline visit the subjects will receive a dose of 50 ± 5 IU/kg rVWF:RCo for PK assessment. Blood samples will be drawn within 30 minutes pre- infusion, and at 11 time points post -infusion (15 ± 5 minutes, 305minutes, 60 5 minutes, 3 ± 0.5 hours, 6 0.5hours, 12  0.5 hours, 240.5hours, 30 ± 2 hours, 48 2 hours, 72 2hours and 96 ± 2 hours). A washout period of at least 5 day s is required prior to infusion of rVWF (vonicog alpha) for PK assessment . The 2ndPK assessment for on- demand subjects will be performed at steady state at the end of the study (see Section 11.6). Subjects previously enrolled in rVWF studies 070701, 071001 or 071101 and having previously undergone PK assessments in these studies are required to repeat the PK assessment due to different dose and time points used in these former studies.

The 2ndPK will be at the end of the stud y. For steady state PK, blood samples will be drawn within 30 minutes pre- infusion, and at 11 time points post - infusion (15 ± 5 minutes, 30 5 minutes, 60 5 minutes, 3 ± 0.5 hours, 6 0.5hours, 120.5 hours, 24 0.5hours, 30 ± 2 hours, 48 2 hours, 72 2 hours and 96 ± 2 hours) as long as it won’t interfere with subject’s the normal dosing schedule, otherwise the 96hr sampling can be omitted (see Section 11.6). Final sample for PK analy sis should be taken before next dose is administered. 8.6.4.2 Prophylaxis Initiation Treatment The rVWF (vonicog alfa) proph ylaxis initiation treatment visit will coincide with the 962 h initial PK assessment for on -demand subjects. For pdVWF switch subjects, the rVWF (vonicog alfa) prophy laxis initiation treatment visit should occur within 42 day s after the completion of screening procedures and confirmation of eligibility . At this visit subjects will receive their proph ylaxis initiation dose. The proph ylaxis doses are described in Section 8.6.4.3 . The subject will be trained on I P reconstitution and administration and may then qualify for home treatment (see Section 8.6.4.3.2). Refer to Table 6(a/b) for stud y procedures and Table 8(a/b) for clinical laboratory assessments. 8.6.4.3 Prophylaxis Treatment For on -demand subjects, the standard prophy lactic dose is 50 ± 10 IU/kg rVWF:RCo, which may be increased up to 80 I U/kg .All on -demand subjects will initially receive rVWF (vonicog alfa) twice per week (Table 1, Schedule A). Examples of all dosing schedules are prov ided in Table 1. For pdVWF switch subjects, the weekl y dose (IU/kg) of IP for each patient will be equivalent (± 10%) to the weekl y VWF dose received d uring proph ylactic treatment with pdVWF. The weekl y dose of IP should be divided into 2 infusions ( Table 1, Schedule A), with a maximum of 80 IU/kg/in fusion.

Dose and frequency adjustments should be agreed with the sponsor in advance unless it constitutes an urgent safet y measure. The rationale for dosing adjustments needs to be documented in the subject’s medical record. For both OD and switch patients, dose escalations (not exceeding the upper dose limit of 80 IU/kg rVWF:RCo) and increase of dose frequency will only be allowed in case of insufficient therapeutic response with breakthrough bleeding episodes. The criteria for dose and/or frequency escalation are specific to each bleeding ind ication but, overall, involve 1 significant breakthrough bleeding episode despite the subject being compliant with scheduled proph ylaxis treatment. For switch patients who require a dose escalation due to a breakthrough bleed, the frequency should be kept the same but the dose (IUVWF:RCo per infusion) should be increased up to 80 I U VWF:RCo. Following that, increases in frequency may be considered upon consultation with the Sponsor. For on demand subjects who require a dose escalation, at the discretion o f the PI upon consultation with the Sponsor, the frequency may be kept the same but the dose (IUVWF:RCo per infusion) should be increased up to 80 I U VWF:RCo. I f this proves to be insufficient, then the dosing frequency may be increased in these subjects.

If a subject experiences a bleed while receiving rVWF (vonicog alfa) three times per week, the investigator should treat the bleed with rVWF (vonicog a lfa) at doses up to 80IU VWF:RCo/kg at a frequency determined b y the investigator until the bleed resolves. Upon resolution of the bleeding event, the subject will return to their assigned prophy laxis regimen. It is essential for the success of this study that the subjects adhere to treatment regimens. Therefore, procedures for monitoring subject’s compliance are implemented (see Section 10.7). If 1infusion of IP is missed, the subject may administer the I P as soon as possible. The subject should adhere to the irtreatment scheme ensuring a minimum interval of 12 hours between this and the previous I P infusion. For example, a subject routinel y infuses I P on Monday and Thursday , he/she misses the Monday time point and therefore may infuse the IP on the next day (Tuesday ) and thereafter proceed with infusing the IP on Thursday (considering a minimum 12 hours between the infusions) and return to the initial schedule. If more than 30% of infusions of IP are missed within the visit interval of 3 months the subject will be discontinued from the stud y (see Section 9.4). 8.6.4.3.2 General Instructions for Home Treatment for Prophylaxis At the discretion of the investigator, a subject may be considered suitable for home treatment only after the subject has received at least 1 infusion of I P in the clinic, either during planned proph ylactic I P exposure or during the treatment of bleeding episodes, and meets the following additional criteria: 1.Fully understands the concept of a clinical study and related documentation (documented training of at least 30 minute s), 2.Has a history of previous experience with home treatment including self-administration and treatment with VWF containing concentrates, 3.Has adequate time for initial training of the stud y drug preparation (preparation, mixing and infusion of the I P(s)(documented training of at least 30 minutes).

I n the event a healthcare professional is required to administer IP, he/she must be tr ained and qualified by the investigator on the above procedures prior to the decision for home treatment. A Subject Guideline detailing all instructions and information listed above will be provided to each subject. 8.6.4.4 Treatment of Bleeding Episodes 8.6.4.4.1 General I nstructions for Home Treatment of Bleeding Episodes If a subject experiences a bleeding episode, he/she should contact the study site immediately and the site investigator should provide instructions on the treatment regimen. If the subject initiates the t reatment at home, he/she should at least follow up with the study site if a visit is needed as per the standard of care at the center. In the event a healthcare professional is required to administer treatment at the subject’s home, he/she must be trained and qualified b y the site investigator on the above procedures prior to the decision for home treatment. Once a subject has received 1infusion of rVWF (vonicog alfa) in the clinic (either during planned IP exposure or during the treatment of a bleeding episode) and meets the criteria for home treatment, the treatment of bleeding episodes with I P can be conducted at home (see Section 8.6.4.3.2). If a subject is not qualified for home treatment, rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusions must be administered at the stud y site. If a subject experiences a bleeding episode that requires treatment between the screening and the proph ylaxis initiation visit, the subject w ill be treated with I P (rVWF with or without ADVATE). Treatment with I P must occur at the study site unless the subject has previously qualified for home treatment with rVWF (vonicog alfa). If rVWF (vonicog alfa) treatment is not feasible, the subject may use his/her standard of care, such as commercial pdVWF/FVIII products. In an y case a washout period of at least 5 days is required prior to rVWF (vonicog alfa) PK infusion at the initial PK assessment visit for on-demand subjects. If a subject experiences a bleeding episode requiring treatment during the PK assessment, rVWF (vonicog alfa) should be used to treat the bleed. Blood draws for PK assessment will be stopped and the PK assessments will be repeated once the bleed has resolved and the subject is fre e of an y symptoms related with the bleeding episode. Dose and frequency of rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusions or any other replacement therapy to stop the bleed should be recorded in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF), and the reason for the use of an y non -IP product or therapy should be documented.

It is the sponsor’s opinion that, in many cases, treatment with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) may not be necessary, since rVWF (vonicog alfa) proph ylaxis will serve to increase endogenous FVIII levels. However, if endogenous FVIII is below 30-40 % or is unknown and cannot be estimated from the subject’s PK study , an infusion of rVWF: ADVATE at a n rVWF: ADVATE ratio of 1.3:1± 0.2 should be administered initially. Subsequent infusions should be with rVWF:RCo 40 to 60 I U/kg with or, in many cases, without 30 to 45 I U/kg ADVATE (only to be administered if plasma FVIII levels fall below 30 IU/L during the treatment period). Dosing may be adjusted downward or upward up to 80 IU/kg rVWF at the treating ph ysician’s discretion based upon the subject’s prior history , PK and ot her factors. If FV III levels are not available, dosing is at the discretion of the investigator based upon the individual subject’s PK data. Using ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) in addition to rVWF (vonicog alfa) in subsequent doses carries the risk of an e xcessive rise in FVIII:C. Therefore, reduced doses of ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) and/or prolongation of the dose interval should be considered. The following is general guidance and the sponsor’s suggestion for treatment of breakthrough bleeds, however each PI will determine the treatment based on the local acceptable practice how to monitor and adjust treatment for a bleeding episode. An effort should be made to discuss with the sponsor (or sponsor’s delegate) the treatment strategy . In general the aim of the initial dose should be full replacement of VWF with VWF:RCo levels of >0.6 IU/ml (60%) and FVIII:C of >0.4 IU/mL (40%). In major bleeding episodes, subsequent doses should keep the trough level of VWF:RCo >50% for 3 day s and then as deemed necessar y by the investigator for subsequent days. In moderate bleeding episodes, the dose and trough level may be reduced to >30% for as long as deemed necessary by the investigator. Treatment for minor bleeding episodes will generall y consist of onl y 1 or 2 dose s of rVWF (vonicog alfa) IP. If the VWF:RCo level is above 150%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 12 hours; if the VWF:RCo level is above 200%, a planned treatment should be delay ed by at least 24 hours. In either case, a lower subsequent dose (e.g., 20 IU/kg VWF:RCo) may be appropriate. Dosing recommendations are listed in Table 3. For non-commercial use only"

A diagnosis of menorrhagia will be defined by a prospectively completed Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) score >185 and normal cervical cytology or requiring use of a VWF -containing concentrate for treatment of excessive menstrual bleeding for at least one menstrual cycle during the prior year. Variances of up to 10% in dosing are permissible during treatmen t of bleeding episodes, but rounding to the nearest vial size should be avoided. Subjects with non- neutralizing binding anti -VWF antibodies should initially be treated with a dose known to be efficacious based on the subject’s medical treatment history which may differ from the recommendations provided in Table 3. Subjects should be monitored for lack of efficacy as well as for FVIII (mandatory ), VWF:RC o (mandatory ), and VWF:Ag (optional where testing is not available) levels after 3 to 6 hours. Re -dosing with rVWF (vonicog alfa) in combination with ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) using the same (initial) dose and adaptation of the dosing frequency should be considered until cessation of the bleed, if the FVIII and/or VWF:RCo levels drop below 30% -50% depending on bleeding severity .

Subjects who at time of screening have an alread y scheduled surgical intervention are not eligible for participation in the study . 8.6.4.5.1 Major, Minor and Oral Surgery Definition The following definitions and criteria are used to serve as a guidance for major, minor and oral surgery . Major surgeries generally refer to major orthopedic surgery (e.g., joint replacement, arthroscopic or open s ynovectomy , arthrodesis, hardware removals like plates or intramedullary nails, etc.), major abdominal surgery (e.g. open or laparoscopic hernioplasty , cholecy stectomy , colon or small bowel resection, etc.), major gy necological surgery (e.g. open or laparoscopic m yomectom y, hysterectomy, removal of endometriosis, poly ps, cysts, adhesioly sis, etc.), major head and neck surgery (e.g.: tonsillectomy , adenoidectomy , rhinoplast y, lymphadenectomy, th yroidectomy , parotidectom y. etc.), an y intracranial , cardiovascular or spinal surgery and any other surgery which has a significant risk of large volume blood loss or blood loss into a confined anatomical space. Extraction of impacted third molars is generall y also considered major surgery due to the expected difficulty of surgery and the expected blood loss. Minor surgeries generally refer to interventions such as placement of intravenous access devices, removal of small skin lesions, arthroscopy, gastroscop y, colonoscopy or conisation. Oral surgeries comprise extractions of fewer than three teeth, if the teeth are non -molars and have no bon y involvement.

As a general guidance a priming dose of 40 -60 IU/kg rVWF:RCo will be administered. If not assessed prior to the preoperative priming dose, a IR recovery may be calculated for subjects undergoing minor and oral surgery . 8.6.4.5.3 Preoperative Loading Dose An rVWF (vonicog alfa) loading dose should be administed within 3 hours before surgery . VWF and FVIII levels should be assessed within 3 hours prior to surgery initiation and results must be available prior to administering the loading dose. If FVIII levels prior to loading dose administration are not at least 30 IU/dL (minor, oral surgery ), or 60 IU/dL (major surgery ) ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) will be administered in addition to rVWF (vonicog alfa) in order to raise FVIII:C levels to recommended levels. The preoperative loading dose will be calculated as the difference in the target peak and baseline plasma VWF:RCo levels divided by the IR ( ΔVWF:RCo x B W (kg) /IR). The PK results will be provided prior to the planned surgery. If the IR is not available, assume an IR of 1.7 IU/dL per IU/kg and calculate the initial dose as follows: (100 –baseline plasma VWF:RCo) x BW (kg) / 1.7. For minor and oral surger y, the IR from the Preoperative Priming Dose visit will be used to guide dosing and the target peak is 50-60 IU/dL VWF:RCo and 40 -50 IU/dL FVIII. For major surgery , the target peak is 100IU/dL VWF:RCo and 80- 100 IU/dL FVIII. The surgery may only start af ter normalization of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). 8.6.4.5.4 Intra- and Postoperative (maintenance) Dosing After the preoperative loading dose(s), subjects who have not achieved the desired postinfusion recovery will continue to receive rVWF (von icog alfa) with or without ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) as a bolus infusion, depending on VWF and FVIII levels.

Subjects undergoing oral surgery will be infused with rVWF (vonicog alfa) at least once within the first 8 -12 hours, targeting >30 IU/dL (rVWF and FVIII). Subjects undergoing major surgery will be infused with rVWF (vonicog alfa) every 12-24 hours for at least the first 72 hours post- surgery , targeting a VWF:RCo and FVIII:C trough plasma level >50 IU/dL, followed by further treatment post -72 hours for as long as deemed necessary by the Investigator, targeting a VWF:RCo and FVIII:C trough plasma level of >30 IU/dL . Dose modifications based on pre -infusion VWF/FVIII levels will be performed as needed. For subsequent infusions post surgery , in case pre -infusion levels are not available prior to the consecutive infusion in a timely manner, pre -infusion levels f rom the previous dose may be used by the investigator for dosing guidance. Peak plasma level guidance is matching to Section 8.6.4.4.2 A schedule of all perioperative visit assessments and laboratory sampling can be found in supplement tables in Section 20.2.1 and Section 20.3.1. 8.6.4.6 Thrombosis Prophylaxis Thromboembolic events have been reported in patients who have VWD, especiall y in the setting of known risk factors for thrombosis including low ADAMTS13 levels. Therefore, subjects who are at risk for developing thromboembolic events should be monitored for earl y signs of thrombosis, and prophylaxis measures against thromboembolism should be instituted according to current recommendations and standard of care. For all subjects who are VWD patients and are receiving VWF concentrate, attention should be given to avoid exceeding maximal recommended plasma activity levels of VWF:RCo (250 IU/dL) and FVIII (250 IU/dL). Anticoagulation measures, such as heparin, are acceptable and should follow study site standards. The investigator will record the use and reasons for such measures/agents on the appropriate CRF.

For example, the third subject who signed an informed consent form at stud y site 02 will be identified as Subject 071301- 020003. All study documents (e.g., CRFs, clinical documentation, sample containers, drug accountability logs, etc.) will be identified with the SI C. Additionally , a uniquely coded SI C(s) is permitted as long as it does not contain a combi nation of information that allows identification of a subject (e.g., collection of a subject’s initials and birth date would not be permitted), in compliance with laws governing data privacy . 10.3 Screening and Study Visits The study site is responsible for mai ntaining a screening log that includes all subjects who provided informed consent. The log also will serve to document the reason for screening failure. All screening data will be collected and reported in CRF, regardless of screening outcome. If a subject is re- screened, the End of Study CRF should be completed, and a new ICF, new SIC and new CRF are required for that subject. The overall study design is illustrated in the Figure 1. Details on the procedures to be performed at each stud y visit, including screening, are provided in Supplement 20.2 „Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments “and Supplement 20.3 „Clinical Laboratory Assessments “. 10.3.1 Screening Visit Written informed consent mu st be obtained from each subject before an y study related procedures are performed. To initiate screening procedures, at least 72 hours must have elapsed since the last VWF administration for on -demand subjects and the subject must not be actively bleeding at the time of screening. For switch subjects, the usual interval between their pdVWF proph y infusions must have elapsed since the last VWF administration and the subject must not be actively bleeding at the time of screening. Multimer analysis and VWD ge ne mutation analy sis should be performed atscreening if not available in the subject’s medical history . For non-commercial use only"

All screening procedures and confirmation of eligibility shall take place within 42days prior to the firstinfusion of IP. I f the IP is not infused within 42days, all screening assessments except blood gr oup, human leukocy te antigen (HLA), genetics, multimeric pattern and , must be repeated to reconfirm eligibility . Refer to Supplement 20.2 and Supplement 20.3. Upon completion of screening procedures, subject eligibility will be confirmed by the sponsor on a subject eligibility form before additional study procedures are undertaken. The subject will maintain a diary that will include infusion logs (see Section 10.5). The allocation of IP will be initiated after the subject has qualified for home treatment (see Section 8.6.4.3.2 ). In the event of a subject experiencing a bleeding episode that requires treatment between the screening visit and the subsequent visit (i.e. initial PK assessment visit for on- demand subjects or proph ylaxis initiation visit for switch su bjects), the subject will be treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa). If rVWF (vonicog alfa) is not available for an y reason, e.g., subject not y et trained on IP administration, study site visit for I P administration not feasible, etc., the subject may use his/he r standard of care, such as commercial pdVWF/FVIII products, and the reason for the use of non -IP products should be clearl y documented. 10.3.2 Baseline Visit – Initial PK Assessment (On -demand Subjects Only) After screening and confirmation of eligibility on-demand subjects will undergo an initial PK assessment. S ubjects will receive a dose of 50 ± 5 IU/kg rVWF:RCo to determine VWF and FVIII levels. Blood samples will be drawn within 30 minutes pre -infusion, and at 11 time points post -infusion (15 ± 5 minutes, 30 5 minutes, 60 5 minutes, 3 ± 0.5 hours, 6 0.5hours, 12  0.5 hours, 24 0.5hours, 30 ± 2 hours, 48 2 hours, 722hours and 96 ± 2 hours). See Section 20.2 and Section 20.3. IP infusion vials from the same lot number should be used for all PK - assessments per subject. Samples for measurement of FVIII and VWF activity taken through to 6 hours post -infusion will be obtained from an extremity different from that used for the infusion of IP. Where needed, the phlebotomy site will be kept patent via an infusion of normal saline. In this event, at least 5 mL of blood will be collected and discarded before collection of the next test sample into a fresh s yringe. If the subject has a central venous catheter, the central line should be used to administer the infusion and a peripheral venipuncture should be used to collect the blood samples.

At least 5 mL of whole blood must be co llected and discarded prior to obtaining the sample. If a subject experiences a bleeding episode during the PK assessment no subsequent blood sample will be drawn in that specific PK period. The guidance provided in Section 8.6.4.4 has to be followed for the treatment of the bleeding episode. The subject once recovered is eligible to repeat the PK assessment. For pdVWF switch subjects, PK profile wi ll not be assessed until reaching steady state after initiation of proph ylaxis (see Section 10.3.4). 10.3.3 Prophylaxis Initiation Visit The proph ylaxis initiation visit will occur after the blood sample for the 96 hour PK assessment is drawn for on -demand subjects or within 42 day s after screening and confirmation of eligibility for pdVWF switch subjects. The subject will receive the first rVWF (vonicog al fa) prophy lactic dose of rVWF: RCo. Details on dose are provided in Section 8.6.4.3. Procedures and assessments at this visit include (but are not limited to) : AEs, bleeding episodes, medications taken , and non-drug therapies . Within 2 hours prior the I P infusion, a phy sical examination will be performed. Vital signs will be assessed within 30 minutes prior to I P rVWF (vonicog alfa) infusion and 30 minutes ± 15 minutes after IP infusion. Further details are provided in Supplement 20.2 and Supplement 20.3. 10.3.4 Initial Steady State PK -Assessment ( pdVWF switch subjects only) For pdVWF switch subjects, a full PK profile will be assessed at stead y state conditions on two occasions. The ini tial PK assessment will be performed shortl y after reaching steady state after starting prophy laxis dosing, which is suggested after 11 day s post the 1st, around proph ylaxis dose #5 -6. The 2ndPK assessment at stead y state will be performed at the end of the study . Blood samples will be drawn within 30 minutes pre- infusion, and at 11 time points post-infusion (15 ± 5 minutes, 30 5 minutes, 60 5 minutes, 3 ± 0.5 hours, 60.5hours, 12 0.5 hours, 24 0.5hours, 30 ± 2 hours, 48 2 hours, 72 2 hours and 96 ± 2 hours).

Within 2 hours prior to the rVWF (vonicog alfa) IP infusion, a phy sical examination will be performed. Vital signs will be assessed within 30 minutes prior to I P infusion and 30 minutes ± 15minutes after IP infusion. Incremental recovery (IR) will be determined at each follow -up visit based on VWF:RCo activity assessed prior to and after IP i nfusion. The blood sample for IR anal ysis will be drawn within 30 minutes prior to IP infusion and 30 minutes ± 5 minutes after IP infusion. rVWF (vonicog alfa) will be infused at the regular proph ylactic dose. For each subject’s recovery anal ysis IP infus ion, vials from the same lot number should be used . Testing for VWF:RCo VWF:CB, rVWF:Ag, and FVIII:C level will be performed using the blood sample obtained before and after IP infusion. The blood sample prior to I P infusion will also be used for the assessment of neutralizing and binding antibodies, clinical chemistry and hematology . For on- demand subjects, a washout period of at least 72 hours after the last infusion applies before the blood draw for the immunogenicity assay s. For switch subjects, the w ash out period may be reduced to the time interval between their pdVWF proph y infusions Bleeding episodes and the hemostatic efficacy will be evaluated based on the review of the patient diary . See Section 20.2 and Section 20.3. The evaluation of IP consumption and treatment compliance will be performed based on subject’s diary entries. If a subject is not compliant with the prophylactic treatment regimen and does not adhere to the required frequency of administration of I P infus ions (>30% of infusions were missed within a visit interval [3 months]) the subject will be withdrawn from the study .

Subjects who have more than one bleeding episode in 3 months, or an increased frequency of bleeding, should go to the study site for an unscheduled visit. Follow - up visits after the subject has experienced a bleed may be requested by the investigat or. Additional assessments may be required which are at the discretion of the investigator. 10.3.9 End of Study PK Assessment and Study Termination Visit At the 12* month ± 2 week visit, a full PK analysis at stead y state will be performed for both cohorts: on-demand and switch subjects. Blood samples will be drawn within 30 minutes pre- infusion, and at 11time points post -infusion (15 ± 5 minutes, 305minutes, 60 5 minutes, 3 ± 0.5 hours, 6 0.5hours, 12  0.5 hours, 240.5hours, 30 ± 2 hours, 48 2 hours, 72 2hours and 96 ± 2 hours) unless dosing schedule does not permit, in which case the 96 hr sampling can be omitted. If a subject experiences a bleeding episode during the PK assessment no subsequent blood sample will be drawn in that specific PK period. The guidance provided in Section 8.6.4.4 has to be followed for the treatment of the bleeding episode. The subject once recovered is eligible to repeat the PK assessment and the PK assessment should be performed after 11days after 1st prophy lactic dose after re -start of prophy lactic regimen.

During study participation the investigator has access to the database holding the subject diary data. After study closure, the investigator will receive the diary records for their subjects , including audit trail records, in PDF format. The data will be transmitted to the CRF by a validated transfer. Paper diary may be utilized in rare case where electronic diary use is not possible. 10.6 Subject Completion/Discontinuation A subject is considere d to have completed the study when he/she ceases active participation in the study because the subject has, or is presumed to have completed all study procedures according with the protocol (with or without protocol deviations).

Regardless of the reason, al l data available for the subject up to the time of completion/discontinuation should be recorded on the appropriate CRF. Every effort will be made to have discontinued subjects complete the study termination visit. I f the termination visit is done as an additional, unscheduled visit, theassessment results shall be recorded with the termination visit. If a subject terminates participation in the study and does not return for termination visit, his/her last recorded assessments shall remain with the last visit. The reason for discontinuation will be recorded, and the data collected up to the time of discontinuation will be used in the anal ysis and included in the clinical study report. If additional assessments are required, the assessments shall be record ed separatel y. Assessments to be performed at the termination visit (including in cases of withdraw or discontinuation) can be found in Supplement 20.2 Schedule of Study Procedures and Assessments and Supplement 20.3 Clinical L aboratory Assessments. In the event of subject discontinuation due to an AE, clinical and/or laboratory investigations that are beyond the scope of the required study observations/assessments may be performed as part of the evaluation of the event. These investigations will take place under the direction of the investigat or in consultation with the sponsor, and the details of the outcome may be reported to the appropriate regulatory authorities by the sponsor. 10.7 Procedures for Monitoring Subject Compliance Subject compliance with the procedures of this study (treatment regi mens and study visits) will be monitored by the investigator or/a licensed healthcare professional at the study site. During the regular scheduled follow -up visits a direct review of the subject’s source data (e-diaries) will be performed at the sites and evaluated against the protocol requirements. In addition drug accountability will be evaluated at each follow -up study visit and the study termination visit by comparing the infusions recorded in the subject diary with empty vials returned by each subject to the study site, and the study site’s dispensing record. Protocol deviations will be noted in the final report. For non-commercial use only"

The following details on bleeding episodes will be recorded b y the subject in the electronic diary (for home treatment), the subject’s healthcare provider in the site’s source documents (for treatments away from the primary investigative site), or by authorized, qualified personnel at the participating site in the subject’s medical records (for hospital -based treatment): Location of bleed; i.e., joint, menorrhagia, epistaxis, gastrointestinal, soft tissue, muscle, body cavit y, intracranial, etc. Type of bleed; i.e., spontaneous, traumatic, unknown Severity of bleed; i.e., minor, moderate, and major (see Table 3) Date and time of onset of bleed Date and time of each infusion of rVWF (vonicog alfa) or rVWF (vonicog alfa) - ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) use d to treat a bleeding episode Date and time of resolution of the bleeding episode Study site personnel are qualified after they have undergone training during the qualification of the site. All ty pes of bleeds, including traumatic bleeds, will be recorded. Bleeding episodes should be organized by where they occur in addition to whether they occurred spontaneously or due to a traumatic event . Bleeds occurring at the same anatomical location (e.g., right knee) with the same etiology (i.e., spontaneous versus injury ) within 24 hours after onset of the first bleed will be considered a single bleed. Bleeding occurring at multiple locations related to the same injury (e.g., knee and ankle bleeds following a fall) will be counted as a single bleeding episode. All e fforts should be made to use rVWF (vonicog alfa) for treatment of bleeding episodes. If needed, the use of a VWF concentrate other than IP for the treatment of bleeding episodes will not disqualify the subject from further participation in the study . For non-commercial use only"

For on -demand subjects, an initial PK assessment using a dose of 50 IU ± 5 IU/kg rVWF:RCo will be performed at the baseline visit, and a washout period of at least 5daysis required before the infusion of rVWF (vonicog alfa) for PK assessment can be administered. At the 12month ± 2 week visit, a steady state PK anal ysis will be performed based on the longer interval of the irregular dosing intervals employ ed. For both assessments, blood samples will be drawn within 30 minutes pre- infusion, and at 11 time points post -infusion (15 ± 5 minutes, 30 5 minutes, 60 5 minutes, 3 ± 0.5 hours, 6 0.5hours, 12  0.5 hours, 24 0.5hours, 30 ± 2 hours, 48 2 hours, 722hours and 96 ± 2 hours).

If a subject experiences a ble eding episode during the PK assessment no subsequent blood sample will be drawn in that specific PK period. The guidance provided in Section 8.6.4.4 has to be followed for the treatment of the bleeding episode. The subject once recovered is eligible to repeat the PK assessment.

An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom (e.g., rash, pain, discomfort, fever, dizziness, etc.), disease (e.g., peritonitis, bacteremia, etc.), or outcome of death temporally associated with the use of an IP, whether or not considered causall y related to the I P. 12.1.1.1 Serious Adverse Event An SAE is defined as an untoward medical occurrence that, at an y dose, meets one or more of the following criteria: Outcome is fatal/results in death (including fetal death) Is life -threatening – defined as an event in which the subject was, in the judgment of the investigator, at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that h ypotheticall y might ha ve caused death had it been more severe. Requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization –inpatient hospitalization refers to any inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay . Results in persistent or sign ificant disability /incapacity (i.e., a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions) Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect Is a medicall y important event –a medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening or resu lt in death or require hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definitions above. Examples of such events are (including but not limited to): Intensi ve treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood d yscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependence or drug abuse Reviewed and confirmed seroconversion for HIV, hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), or parvovirus B19 (B19V) For non-commercial use only"

However, when there is an increase in the severit y, duration, or frequency of a preexisting disease, the event must be described as “worsening” of the pre-existing condition on the AE CRF. 12.1.2 Assessment of Adverse Events For the purposes of this study , the following will not be considered as AEs and will not be included in the analy sis of AEs. Bleeding episodes are part of the underl ying disease and therefore are not AEs; they will be evaluated in the context of efficacy . For non -serious bleeding episode scaused by an injury , the injury would not be reported as an AE, unless it resulted in a medical finding other than a bleeding episode (e.g., abrasion of skin). Therefore, any VWD -related bleeding event (e.g., epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, musculo -skeletal bleeding, menorrhagia) that is non -serious will not be reported as an AE. However, the investigator may decide that the event is an AE if the event also would have occurred in a healthy individual under the same circumstances.  For serious bleeding episodes (bleeding SAEs): Bleeding events that meet seriousness criteria (death, life -threatening, hospitalizing/prolongation of hospitalization, disability , congenital anomal y, or medically significant and if not urgentl y treated would result in one of the above) should be captured on the SAE eCRF and reported as an SAE to the Sponsor or designee (e.g., CRO) on an SAE Report form as described in Section 12.1.2.3 (Safet y Reporting). Seroconversion after documented HAV/HBV vaccination prior to or during the study period.

Each AE will be evaluated b y the investigator for: Seriousness as defined in Section 12.1.1.1 Severity as defined in Section 12.1.2.1 Causal relationship to I P exposure or stud y procedure as defined in Section 12.1.2.2 For each AE, the outcome (i.e., recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved, recovered/resolved with sequela e, not recovered/not resolved, fatal, unknown) and if applicable, action taken with regards to the stud y treatment (i.e., dose increased, dose not changed, dose reduced, drug interrupted, drug withdrawn, not applicable, or unknown) will also be recorded on the AE CRF. Recovering/resolving AEs will be followed until resolution or until the subject’s condition returns to the level at the baseline for pre - existing conditions. If the severity rating for an ongoing AE changes before the event resolves, the orig inal AE report will be revised (i.e., the event will not be reported as separate AE). During the course of an y AE, the highest severit y rating will be reported. Deviations from the protocol-specified dosage (including underdosing /overdosing [<20 IU/kg rVW F:RCo or >100 rVWF:RCo], abuse, and withdrawal, treatment errors (including incorrect route of administration, use of an incorrect product, and deviations from the protocol -defined dosing schedule), failures of expected pharmacological actions, and unexpec ted therapeutic or clinical benefits will be followed with regard to occurrence of AEs, lack of efficacy , and/or other observations because these events may be reportable to regulatory authorities.

In general all laboratory tests will be performed at central laboratories, except the pregnancy and blood group test which will be performed at the local laboratory . In addition, relevant critical safet y laboratory tests for complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry and/or coagulation parameters such as VWF and FVIII activity may also be performed in the local lab oratory to ensure that results will be available immediately to the investigator. In principle, results from the central laboratory will be used for data analysis purposes. The assay s performed in the central laboratories are specified in the Laboratory Manual. The investigator will supply the sponsor with a list of the normal ranges and units of measurement for the laboratory variables to be determined at the site. Laboratory values such as antibodies to other proteins are not required immediately and willbe assessed later during the course of the study. Any abnormal laboratory value that is considered clinically significant b y the investigator based on a local laboratory test result (reference range and the units to be provided) should be confirmed b y a central laboratory test result for which the sample is drawn/collected within 24 hours of the abnormal finding b y the local laboratory. 12.9.1 rVWF Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Details on pharmacokinetic and pharmacod ynamics assessments are provided in Section 11.6. 12.9.2 Hematology and Clinical Chemistry The hematology panel will consist of CBC [hemoglobin, hematocrit, ery throcy tes (ie, red blood cell c ount [RBC] ; mean corpuscular volume [MCV ], mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration [MCHC]), and leukocytes (i.e., white blood cell count [WBC])] with differential (i.e., basophils, eosinophils, lymphocy tes, monocy tes, n eutrophils) and platelet counts.

Hematology and clinical chemistry assessments will be performed on Ethy lenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) -anticoagulated whole blood and serum, respectivel y, at the central laboratory. 12.9.3 Immunology 12.9.3.1 Antibodies to VWF and FVIII All subjects will be tested for binding and neutralizing antibodies to VWF and FVIII at screening, at initial PK assessment, at each of the scheduled follow -up visits and at the study completion visit. Testing will be done prior to I P infusion and with at least a 72hour wash out period since the last I P infusion. If there is any suspicion of inhibitor development (e.g. excessive bleeding) binding and neutrali zing antibodies to VWF and FVIII may be tested at the discretion of the investigator. 12.9.3.2 Neutralizing and Total Binding Anti -VWF Antibodies The assay s to establish the presence of neutralizing and total binding anti -VWF antibodies have been established in the absence of international standards and with only limited numbers of positive controls. Therefore, caution is advised in interpreting positive results. I n particular, any clinical association, changes in the natural history of the disease, effect of thera py, etc. needs to be taken into account for final judgment. Thesponsor’s Medical Director should be consulted for additional advice. As part of the AE follow -up, an y sample testing positive needs to be confirmed after 2 -4 weeks for central laboratory testing. Only confirmed neutralizing anti -VWF antibodies are considered inhibitors (see Section 12.9.3.4). These subjects need to be closely monitored and therap y adjusted accordingl y. 12.9.3.3 Binding antibodies to VWF The presence of total binding anti -VWF antibodies will be determined by an enzy me- linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) employ ing poly clonal anti -human Immunoglobulin (Ig) antibodies (IgG, IgM and IgA). For this assay (ELI SA), recombinant human VWF will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then incubated with dilutions of the positive control, the negative control or test sample. Antibodies against human VWF that are present in the samples bind to th e coated antigen and will be detected with a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled goat anti- human antibody (secondary antibody ). The positive control for this assay will be a human monoclonal antibody specific for human VWF spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this assay is pooled normal human plasma.

First, the sample is screened for antibodies and the titer of binding antibodies is determine d. Second, the specificit y of positive antibody results is confirmed.16 Inbrief, all samples are serially diluted (initial dilution 1:20 and further diluted 1:2). Thetiter endpoint, defined as the highest dilution that still gives a positive signal above cut off level, is determined in two independ ent duplicates. The cut off level is established based on background signal level of healthy plasma donors (n=160) and set to include 5% false positives to be as sensitive as possible (95% percentile). The ELISA assay is validated allowing an assay variabi lity of ± 1 titer step. Therefore, differences ≤ 2 titers steps may be due to variability of the ELISA assay. Specificity has to be confirmed in a competition assay when a sample has a titer of 1:80 or higher in the screening assay . Based on the validation criteria samples tested in the screening assay at 1:20 or 1:40 cannot be confirmed in the competition assay . A positive screening value is confirmed if the difference between the titers determined for the subject sample (re -screen) and for the subject sam ple with pre -incubation (confirmation sample) is > 2 titer steps. Antibody titers of subject samples will only be reported as positive, if the results of the screening and confirmatory anal ysis fulfill these acceptance criteria. The titer to be reported is alway s the one determined in the original screening procedure (independent of the result of the re -screening in the confirmation procedure). A more detailed test procedure will be supplied upon request or pro -actively if a sample tests positive. A treatment related increase of the binding anti -VWF antibodies is expected, if the titer increases by more than 2 titration steps. These subjects need to be closely monitored and therapy adjusted accordingly . 12.9.3.4 Neutralizing Antibodies to VWF Three functional VWF assay s, VWF:CB, VWF:RCo and VWF:FVIIIB assay s, will be used to test for the presence of neutralizing anti -VWF antibodies. Neutralizing antibodies to VWF:RCo, VWF:CB and VWF:FVIIIB activities will be measured b y assay s based on the Bethesda assay establ ished for quantitative analy sis of FVIII inhibitors (Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay ).17The amount of inhibitor is expressed as BU per mL. One BU is thereb y defined as the amount of inhibitor that decreases the measured activity in the assay s to 50% of that of the negative control samples. The assay s were validated using human plasma samples from two ty pe 3 VWD patients with low (1- 2 BU/mL) and high (~10 BU/mL) titer inhibitors and plasma samples from non-human primates immunized with human rVWF (vonicog alfa) (>100 BU/mL) .

However, if baseline levels are too high (>15% VWF:RCo), inhibitors may not be reliabl y detected. To exclude false positive results, the detection limit for anti- VWF inhibitors was set to 1BU/ml for all 3 assay s. The rationale for this cut -off value is the relativel y high CIof the underl ying assay s, making determinations at the end of the evaluation range of the Bethesda reference curve uncertain.18A more detailed test procedure may be requested to further characterize the anti- VWF inhibitors, if detected. Only confirmed positive anti -VWF inhibitor test result will be reported and will be considered as a medically significant SAE. 12.9.3.5 Binding Antibodies to FVIII Binding antibodies against FVIII will be anal yzed using a proprietary enzyme immunoassay . The testing strategy will be as described for binding anti- VWF antibodies. Antibody -containing samples will be identified in a screening as say followed by a confirmatory assay to exclude false positive results. 12.9.3.6 Neutralizing Antibodies (Inhibitors) to FVIII Neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) to FVIII will be assessed b y the Nijmegen modification of the Bethesda assay in a central laboratory . To verify a FVIII inhibitor, additional testing (such as tests for L upus anticoagulants) may be initiated. Positive FVIII inhibitor tests will be defined as ≥ 0.4 BU b y the Nijmegen -modified Bethesda assay that is confirmed b y a second test performed on an independent sample obtained 2- 4 weeks following the first test. Only confirmed positive FVIII inhibitor test result will be reported. 12.9.4 Antibodies to Other Proteins Plasma will be assay ed for the presence of antibodies against CHO protein (total Ig), muri ne IgG and human Furin (total Ig) using proprietary enzy me immunoassay s.

For this assay (ELISA), CHO protein derived from cultures of untransfected cells and propagated under the identical cell culture conditi ons used for ADVATE (rFVIII, octocog alfa) production will be coated onto a microtiter plate, then incubated with dilutions of the positive control, negative control or test sample. Antibodies against CHO protein that are present in the samples bind to the coated antigen and will be detected with a HRP- coupled goat anti-human antibody (secondary antibody ). The positive control for this assay will be a polyclonal goat anti -CHO protein antibody spiked into the negative control. The negative control for this a ssay is pooled normal human plasma. 12.9.4.2 Anti -Murine IgG A commerciall y available ELI SA (Medac, Hamburg, Germany ) will be used to detect and to quantify IgG antibodies originating from human plasma that are directed against mouse -IgG (HAMA: human anti -mouse antibodies). M icrotiter plates coated with mouse IgG will be incubated with dilutions of the standard, the positive control, the negative control or the test sample. Antibodies against mouse IgG that are present in thesamples bind to the coated antigen and form a bridge to a peroxidase coupled mouse IgGantibody that will be used for detection (bridging format of the ELISA assay ). Thepositive control for this assay will be a poly clonal goat anti-murine IgG spiked into the negative control. The negative cont rol for this assay is pooled normal human plasma. 12.9.4.3 Antibodies to Human Furin Total Ig antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM) against human Furin will be anal yzed.

In vitro and in vivo cleavage of these ultralarge molecular fractions by ADAMTS13 and generation of characteristic satellite bands has been extensively demonstrated during nonclini cal and clinical development. Nevertheless, the potential elevated risk of thrombosis and/or other thromboembolic complications due to the administration of ultra large molecular VWF multimers in subjects with normal levels of VWF cannot be completely excl uded. Therefore VWF multimer anal ysis will not only be performed routinel y at screening but in case of thromboembolic events, both VWF multimer anal ysis as well as ADAMTS13 activity will be determined to assess an y relatedness of these occurrences with I P treatment. 12.9.10.1 VWF Multimer Analysis The VWF multimer pattern will be assessed using low- resolution sodium dodecy l sulfate (SDS) –agarose gel electrophoresis. High -resolution SDS –agarose gel electrophoresis, with agarose concentrations 1.5%, will be used to determine the satellite band structure of VWF. These anal yses will employ Western blot with luminescence video imaging. 12.9.10.2 ADAMTS13 Activity VWF73 was identified as the 73 amino acid minimal region of the VWF A2 domain required for ADAMTS13 cleavage. The cleavage of this substrate will be detected b y a commerciall y available ELISA -based Chromogenic assay (Technoclone Austria): Cleavage of immobilized VWF73 substrate is detected b y a HRP -labeled antibody directed against the cleavage site of VWF73.

While a negative result practically rules out thrombo sis, a positive result can indicate thrombosis but does not rule out other potential etiologies, including a recent hemorrhage. Its main use, therefore, is to exclude thromboembolic disease where the probability is low. D -Dimer will be measured at the Scre ening visit and used as indicator for an increased thrombotic risk. 12.9.13 Additional Laboratory Testing in Case of Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions If a subject develops a severe hypersensitivity reaction in the course of the clinical study ,additional blood w ill be drawn for anti- VWF IgE antibod y testing. The presence of anti-VWF IgE will be determined by using the ImmunoCAP®, a VWF -specific IgE blood test (Thermo Scientific). The basis of the ImmunoCAP® technology isa cellulose polymer as solid phase in a pl astic capsule providing a large surface for protein binding. rVWF (vonicog alfa) as antigen is covalently coupled to the cellulose polymer. Detection of specific anti -VWF IgE bound to the antigen will be accomplished by a secondary enzy me-labeled anti -hum an IgE antibody . Testing for binding anti -human VWF IgE antibodies will be done with 0.5 mL plasma. Antibody containing samples will be identified and quantified in a screening assay followed by a confirmatory assay to exclude false positive results. 12.9.14 Asses sment of Laboratory Values 12.9.14.1 Assessment of Abnormal Laboratory Values For VWF and FVIII laboratory assessments no evaluation of clinical significance is necessary .

If data are considered spurious, e.g. for lack of biological plausibility , it will be documented to include the reason for exclusion and the anal yses from which the data were excluded. 13.3.2 Other 1.Regarding missing data in PK records: Body weight: If a subject’s weight is missing from the PK in fusion record, the subject’s last recorded weight will be used to calculate the weight -adjusted dose. Concentration: Baseline concentration levels reported as below the limit of quantification will be considered to be 0. Missing VWF baseline concentration levels (VWF: RCo, VWF: AG or VWF: CB) for Ty pe 3 subjects will be set to 0. Time: If start time of infusion is missing (but stop time is available) and actual collection time is available, then stop time of infusion will be taken for further calculation (i .e. time difference between actual end date/time of infusion and date/time blood sample drawn). If actual collection date/time is missing and planned collection date/time is missing, then this PK time point will be taken out from the PK anal ysis (i.e. no data entry for this time point). For all other scenarios, the planned collection date/time will be taken for further calculation. 2.Regarding missing data in AE records: Handling of unknown causality assessment: If a subject experiences an AE with a missing causality assessment, the relationship of the AE will be counted as “related.” For non-commercial use only"

No formal statistical hypothesis test is planned for the analy sis. The primary efficacy anal ysis will be based on the FAS and will be summarized by the two cohorts: on -demand and switch subjects. As a supportive anal ysis, the same anal ysis will also be carried out on the PP analy sis set. The spontaneous ABR while treated with rVWF (vonicog alfa) for each cohort will be estim ated using a negative binomial regression. The prior ABR will be based on historical data collected from each enrolled subject. The two ABRs (prior to prophy laxis treatment and while on prophy laxis) for each cohort will be compared within each subject usi ng a generalized linear mixed- effects model (GLMM) (with a logarithmic link function, the default for the negative binomial distribution), accounting for the fixed effect of the two treatments. The follow -up time (inyears) will be specified as an offset. The ratio of ABR while in the stud y to historical ABR will be estimated and reported together with the 95% confidence interval for each of the two cohorts. The difference in on -study ABR relative to historical ABR will be also summarized descriptivel y. For non-commercial use only"

Mean, standard deviation, median, range, quartiles will be calculated for contin uous endpoints. Proportions, will be calculated for categorical endpoints. Confidence intervals at the two -sided 95% level will be provided when appropriate. 13.4.2.1 Additional Efficacy of Prophylaxis Treatment with rVWF The number and proportion of on- demand s ubjects with ABR percent reduction success (i.e.≥ 25%) will be calculated together with a two -sided, 95% CI for the proportion. The number and proportion of pdVWF switch subjects ABR preservation success will be reported together with the corresponding 95 % two -sided CI s for the proportion. The number and proportion of subjects with categorized spontaneous ABR (i.e. 0, 1-2, 3- 5, more than 5 bleeds) will be reported descriptivel y. Summary statistics for the total number of infusions, as well as average numb er of infusions per week will be provided. The total weight adjusted consumption of rVWF (vonicog alfa) during prophy lactic treatment will be provided. If applicable, historical data on consumption of pdVWF prior to the study will be summarized as well. The change in spontaneous ABR from the historical rate to that during the rVWF (vonicog alfa) proph ylaxis period will be summarized by location of bleeding (GI, epistaxis, joint bleeding, menorrhagia, oral and other mucosa, muscle and soft tissue, etc.). 13.4.2.2 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analysis All PK and PD analy ses will use the actual sampling times, not nominal times specified in the protocol, wherever possible. Actual sampling times will be defined as time from the start of infusion to the blood samp le collection time. A deviation from the protocol - specified blood sample drawing time window will not be a reason to exclude an observation from the analy sis. Samples with unknown actual and planned collection date/time or where the concentration could not be determined, or where results were biologicall y implausible will be eliminated from the anal ysis. If any concentration data are considered spurious (e.g. lack of biological plausibility ), the reason for exclusion from the anal ysis and the analy sis from which the data point was excluded will be documented.
