The medical and so cietal imp acts are considerable and obesity is one of the most significant public health challenges worldwide1-7. Obesity is associated with increased risk of a variety of comorbidi ties including hyperglycaemia, type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, urinary incontinence, non-alcoholic s teatohepatitis, cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancer, and risk of early death 8-22. Moreover, obesity adversely affects physical and mental health a nd reduces health related quality of life23, 24. Obesity is also associated with decreased cardiorespiratory fitness, which also increases the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality25. The risk of obesity-related complications and comorbidities increases with increasing body mass index (BMI), and a weight loss of 5 −10% has significant health benefits in terms of slowing progression to T2D26-29. Furthermore, a weight loss of 5 −10% improves many other obesity related comorbidities as well as physical symptoms and quality of life 30-37. Finally, studies suggest a beneficial impact of weight loss on cardiovascular risk and mortality in both people with diabetes and obesity38-40. Lifestyle intervention in the form of diet and exercise is first line treatment for obesity, but most people with obesity struggle to achie ve and maintain their weight loss41-50. Surgical treatments offer an effective alternative for some people with seve re obesity, but surgery carries a risk in connection with the procedure and is not without complications. Furthermore, surgery requires close follow-up of the individual which can be cumbersome and costly41-46, 51, 52. Pharmacotherapy may therefore serve as a valuable adjunct to lifestyle interventio n for individuals with obesity in order to achieve and sustain a clinically relevant weight loss, to improve comorbid condi tions and to facilitate a healthier lifestyle. Few anti-obesity medications are c urrently available and there is a need for more safe and effective therapeutic options for treatment of obesity, especially tr eatments that also target weight maintenance, prevention and treatment of comorbidities41-45, 53, 54. The present trial is a 68-week trial designed to show reduction in body weight and compare the effect and safety of once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg vers us semaglutide placebo as an adjunct to reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in subjects with overweight or obesity who have reached target dose of semaglutide during a 20 weeks run-in period. The purpose of the trial is: !to investigate the effect of semaglutide on body weight in subjects who have reached the target dose during run-in !to access the weight development after switchi ng to semaglutide placebo (withdrawal trial design) as recommended in the regulatory guidelines CONFIDENTIAL"

Semaglutide has been optimised resulting in a longer half-life of approximately 160 hours, making it suitable for once-weekly dosing55. GLP-1 RA is a phys iological regulator of appetite and GLP-1 receptors are present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation56. A 52-week phase 2 dose-finding tr ial within weight ma nagement (NN9536-4153) has recently been completed. A total of 957 randomised subjects with obesity (without diabetes) were exposed to semaglutide (n=718), liraglutide 3.0 mg (n=103) or placebo (n=136). In this trial, an overall monotone dose-dependent weight loss was observed across the 5 semaglutide doses tested (0.05 to 0.4 mg once-daily). The es timated weight loss at week 52 was 13.8% at the highest dose tested (0.4 mg once-daily) compared to the weight loss of 2.3% achieved by diet, exercise and placebo alone 57. Clinical58-62and non-clinical data63indicate that the body weight-redu cing effect of semaglutide is mainly mediated by a reduced energy intake. No unexpected safety findings were identified and the tolerability and safety profile was overall consistent with previous findings in the T2D development programme and the GLP-1 RA class in general. A comprehensive review of results from the non-clinical and clinical studies of semaglutide can be found in the current edition of the investigator’s brochure (IB) 57and any updates hereof. 3.2.2 Trial population The trial population w ill consist of subjects with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) or with overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2) and weight-related comorbidities. Thes e subjects represent a clinically relevant population for pharmacotherapeutic weight management as they are at significant risk for weight-related morbidities and mortality, and are likely to benefit from weight reduction. Information about weight-related comorbidities, including hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea or cardiovascular disease, will be collected systemat ically at screening by the investigators as part of the medical history. Subjects with T2D are excluded from the trial. Sub jects with overweight or obesity and T2D will be addressed in a dedicated trial. First line treatment in weight management should always be lifestyle modification through a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.

Results from the phase 2 trial (NN9536- 4153) demonstrated that semaglutide once-daily as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity was effective for weight loss in subjects with obesity, while displaying a satisfactory tolerability profile. Overall, a monotone dose-dependent weight loss was observed across all tested doses of semaglutide (0.05 to 0.4 mg once-daily). The weight loss was 11.55 percentages point larger for the 0.4 mg group compared with placebo. Weight loss was accompanied by a consistent improvement in the weight-related comorbidities, indicated by cardiovascular risk factors, lipid profile and glycaemic factors, as well as improvements in clinical outcome assessments. In addition, it is expected that all subjects will be nefit from participation through close contact with the trial site and counselling by a dietician or a similar qualified healthcar e professional, all of which will most likely result in intensified weight management. 3.3.2 Risks and precautions The sections below describe identified and potential risks associated with semaglutide treatment. The identified/potential risks are based on findings in non-clinical studies and clinical trials with semaglutide as well as other GLP-1 RAs. For each of these risks, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial. Identified risks !Gastrointestinal adverse events Consistent with findings with other GLP-1 RAs, the most frequently reported adverse events (AE) in clinical trials with semaglutide were ga strointestinal AEs. A low starting dose and dose escalation steps will be implemented in the trial to mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs. !Cholelithiasis Events of cholelithiasis were the most frequently reported gallbladder events in the phase 2 weight management trial (NN9536-4153) and were in a few instances co-reported with the event adjudication committee (EAC) confirmed acute pancreatitis. As a precaution, if cholelithiasis is suspecte d, appropriate clinical follow-up is to be initiated at the investigator’s discretion. !Acute pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been observed with the use of GLP-1 RA drug class. As a precaution, subjects with a history of chronic pancreatitis or recent acute pancreatitis will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, trial product should be discontinued in case of suspicion of acute pancreatitis in accordance to Section 8.1.  CONFIDENTIAL"
16,page_16,"Protocol CONFIDENTIALDate: 21 D ecember 2017 Novo Nordisk Trial ID: NN9536-4376 Version: 2.0 Status: Final Page: 15 of 94 Potential risks !Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) (based on non-clinical data) Expected proliferative thyroid C-cell changes were seen in the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies after daily exposure to semaglutide for 2 years. No hyperplasia was observed in monkeys after 52 weeks exposure up to 13-fold above the clinical plasma exposure at 2.4 mg/week. In clinical trials with semaglutide, there have been no reports of MTC or clinically relevant changes in calcitonin levels. The C-cell changes in rodents are mediated by the GLP-1 receptor, which is not expressed in the normal human thyroid. Accordingly, the risk of GLP-1 receptor-mediated C-cell changes in humans is considered to be low. However, as a precaution, exclusion a nd discontinuation criteria related to medical history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) or MTC and elevated plasma levels of calcitonin (biomarker for MTC) ha ve been implemented in the trial. !Pancreatic cancer There is currently no support from non-clinical studies, clinical trials or post-marketing data that GLP-1 RA-based therapies increase the risk of pancreatic cancer, but pancreatic cancer has been classified as a potential class risk of GLP-1 RAs by European Medicines Agency. As a precaution, subjects with a history of malignant neoplasms within the past 5 years prior to screening will be excluded from the trial. !Allergic reactions As is the case with all protein-based pharmaceuticals, subjects treated with semaglutide are at risk of developing immunogenic and allergic reactions. As a precaution, subjects with known or suspected hypersensitivity to semagluti de or related products will not be enrolled in this trial. Other risks !Pregnancy and fertility (based on non-clinical data) Studies in animals have shown reproductive t oxicity. There are limited data from the use of semaglutide in pregnant women. Therefore, semaglutide should not be used during pregnancy. Exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to pregnancy have been implemented in the trial. 3.3.3 Conclusion on benefit-risk profile Necessary precautions have been implemented in the design and planned conduct of the trial in order to minimise the risks and inconveniences of participation in the trial. The safety profile for semaglutide generated from the clinical and non-clinical development programme has not revealed any safety issues that would prohibit administration of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once-weekly. The results of the phase 2 trial (NN9536-4153) indicate that semaglutide will provide a clinically meaningful weight loss. In conclusion, the potential risk to the subjects in this trial is considered low and outweighed by the anticipated benefits that semaglutide would provide subjects included in the trial. CONFIDENTIAL"

The 7 weeks follow-up period is incl uded to account for the exposure and long half-life of semaglutide. A 68-week treatment duration is cons idered sufficient to assess weight loss, safety and tolerability in the phase 3 weight man agement development progr amme in accordance with regulatory guidelines64, 65. A randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, multi- centre withdrawal trial design is chosen to minimise bias in the assessment of the effect and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg once-weekly versus semaglutide placebo, as an adjunct to a reduced- calorie diet and increased physical activity. A withdrawal clinical trial design is chosen in order for the trial to support the purpose and objectives set for the trial. 5.5 Justification for dose Results from the phase 2 dose-finding trial (NN9536-4153) showed that the semaglutide 0.4 mg once-daily dose was most effective in terms of weight loss while displaying an acceptable tolerability profile. Using population pharmacokinetic modelling, it was estimated that a once-weekly maintenance dose of 2.4 mg semag lutide will result in similar C maxat steady-state as that obtained by the onc e-daily 0.4 mg s emaglutide dose in trial NN9536-4153. A maintenance dose of 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly has been chosen for the phase 3 weight management development programme. The once-weekly dosing is anticipated to ease the burden of drug administration in clinical practice. Subjects will be initiated at a once-weekly dose of 0.25 mg and follow a fixed-dose escalation regimen, with dose increases every 4 weeks (to doses of 0.5, 1.0, 1.7 and 2.4 mg/week), until the target dose is reached after 16 weeks. It is well known that to mitigate gastrointestina l side effects with GL P-1 RA treatment, dose escalation to the target dose is required. Based on experience from the semaglutide T2D development programme, a similar fixed-dose escalation regimen was selected, with dose escalation every 4 weeks until the target dose of 2.4 mg is reached after 16 weeks. Please refer to Section 7.1for more details on treatment doses. 6 Trial population Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrolment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted.  CONFIDENTIAL"

Counselling should be done by a dietician or a similar qualified healthcare professional every 4 thweek via visits/phone contacts. Subjects will be asked to record their food intake and physical activity at least 3 days prior to the phone contacts and clinic visits according to the flowchart to assist their lifestyle intervention. However, the subject should be encouraged to keep diary of their food intake and physical activity on a daily basis. After week 0 the subjects can use a tool of their own choice (paper/app/other tool) for recording, ensuring it can be reviewed during diet and physical activity counselling. Subjects must receive instructions in how to capture the physical activity and food intake. Calculation of estimated TEE The TEE is calculated by multiplying the estimated Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) (see Table 7-4 ) with a Physical Activity Level value of 1.368.  CONFIDENTIAL"

These events are reviewed by an independent external EAC in a blinded manner, refer to Appendix 3 for further details. There are four ways to identify events relevant for adjudication as described below: !Investigator-reported events for adjudication: When reporting AEs, the investigator must select the appropriate AE category based on pre-defined criteria (see Table 9-1 and Appendix 4 ) !Death !AE Search (standardised screening): All AEs not directly reported by the investigator as requiring adjudication, will undergo screening to identify potential events for adjudication. The investigator can be queried to provide addi tional information related to the reported AE, e.g. alternative aetiology, underlying cause(s) and/or clinical details. !EAC-identified events: When reviewing source documents provided for another event for adjudication, the EAC can identify additional events in scope for adjudication that were not initially reported by the investigator. In these in stances, the investigator will be notified of the newly identified event and has the option to report the EAC-identified event. Regardless of whether the investigator decides to report the event, it will undergo adjudication. Occasionally, EAC-identified ev ents may require the investigator to collect additional source documents, which should be provided by uploading to the event adjudication system (EAS). With the exception of EAC-identified events, an event-specific adjudication form for the event in question should be completed in the CRF within 14 calendar days of the investigator's first knowledge of the event. Copies of collected source documents should be labelled with trial ID, subject and AE number, redacted (anonymised of personal identifiers) and uploaded to the EAS within 4 weeks according to instructions outlined in the event adjudication site manual. If no, or insufficient source documents are provided to the adjudication supplier, the investigator can be asked to complete a clinical narrative and to be uploaded to the EAS. If new information becomes available for an event sent for adjudication, it is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure the new information is uploaded to the EAS. 9.2.2 Method of detecting AEs and SAEs Care should be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and non leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about events. CONFIDENTIAL"

Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Appendix 4 . 9.2.4 Regulator y reporting requirements for SAEs Prompt notification by the investigator to Novo Nordisk of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects and the safety of a trial product under clinical investigation are met. Novo Nordisk has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a trial product under clinical investigation. Novo Nordisk will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authori ty, IRB/IEC, and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) according to local regulatory requirements and Novo Nordisk policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety information (e.g. summary or listing of SAEs), from Novo Nordisk will review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 9.2.5 Hypoglycaemic, cardi ovascular and death events Hypoglycaemic, cardiovascular and death events will be handled and reported according to AE/SAEs description in Section 9.2.1 . 9.2.6 Disease-related ev ents and/or disease-related outcomes not qualifying as an AE or SAE Not applicable for this trial. 9.2.7 Pregnancies a nd associated adverse events Details of pregnancies in female subjects will be collected after the first-trial-related activity after obtaining informed consent and until the ‘end of trial’ visit.

As part of the medical history information related to history of gallbladder disease, breast neoplasm, colon neoplasm, skin cancer, and psychiatric disorder will be recorded. Follow-up questions will be asked at the end of trial related to the breast neoplasm and colon neoplasm. In case of an abnormal and clinically significant finding, the investigator must record the finding on the Medical History/Concomitant Illness form if it is present at screening. Any new finding fulfilling the AE definition (see Appendix 4 ) during the trial and any clinically significant worsening from baseline must be reported as an AE (see Section 9.2). 9.4.1 Mental health assessment instruments !PHQ-973is a 9-item depression module of the patient health questionnaire, which is a self - administered diagnostic tool used for assessment of mental disorders. The questionnaire will be available in a linguistically validated translated version. !C-SSRS74is a detailed questionnaire assessing both suicidal behaviour and suicidal ideation. The questionnaire will be administered as an interview by the investigator or a qualified delegate. The questionnaire (C-SSRS Baseline and C-SSRS Since Last Visit) will be available in a linguistically validated translated version. oPrior to administering the C-SSRS quest ionnaire, the investigator or qualified delegate must complete sufficient training. If a subject has a PHQ-9 score of 10-14 both inclusive the subject should be referred to a mental health profe ssional ( MHP) if judged relevant by the investigator. If referral is not deemed relevant this, along with the reason why, must be documented in the subject’s medical records. A subject must be referred to a MHP if: !the subject has a PHQ-9 score ≥15 or !the subject has any suicidal behaviour or !the subject has any suicidal ideation of type 4 or type 5 on any C-SSRS assessment or !in the opinion of the investigator, it is necessary for the safety of the subject If one or more of the referral criteria are met, the investigator should explain to the subject why the referral and psychiatric evaluation by a MHP is needed. If the subject refuses to be referred to a MHP, the subject’s decision shoul d be documented in subject’s medical record and the investigator  CONFIDENTIAL"

However, no formal statist ical inference is planned based on number of adverse events. Given the tr ial sample size, the power of statistical tests for effect endpoints is described below. The tests of superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg to semagl utide placebo for the primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints are performed using the fixed-sequence statistical strategy. This strategy tests the endpoints using a predefined h ierarchical order, all at the significance level of 5%, moving to test the next endpoint only after a statistically significant superiority result (p-value < 5%) on the previous endpoint. The test hierarchy is given in Table 10-2 with underlying assumptions, marginal power and effective pow er. The effective power is calculated under the assumption of independence of endpoints by multiplying the respective marginal powers successively. In the analysis approach addressing the primary estimand, week 68 assessments from retrieved subjects (AD) are used. These data are also used to impute missing measurements at week 68 for non-retrieved subjects (MD). The imputation is done separately within each treatment arm (see description below). However, for the power calculations missing values (MT and MD), regardless of treatment arm, are assumed to be similar to semaglutide placebo subjects. These assumptions are likely conservative with respect to the power, and correspond to the jump to reference sensitivity analysis planned below. Assumptions The common assumptions for the power calculations are !The significance level is 5% !The randomisation ratio is 2:1 CONFIDENTIAL"

Given these assumptions, the sample size of 750 subjects (500 in the semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly and 250 in the semaglutide placebo arm), gives an effective power (marginal powers multiplied) of 95% for the first four endpoints in the hierarchical testing procedure. Under the additional assumption that minimum 80% of subjects will be eligible for randomisation a total of 900 subjects will be started on trial product. As sample size is primarily driven by safety, additional scenarios for assumptions are not included due to the overall high power.

Any observation excluded from the analysis will be documented before database lock with the reason for exclusion provided. Two observation periods are defined for each subject: !In-trial: The in-trial period is defined as the uninterrupted time interval from date of week 0 to date of last contact with trial site. !On-treatment (with trial product): A time-point is cons idered as ‘on-treatment’ if any dose of trial product has been administered within the prior 2 weeks (14 days). The on-treatment period is defined as all times which are considered on-treatment. oIn general, the on-treatment period will th erefore be from the date of first trial product administration to date of last trial product administration excluding potential off-treatment time intervals triggered by at least two consecutive missed doses. oFor the evaluation of adverse events the lag time for each on-treatment time interval is 7 weeks (49 days) applicable to all subjects treated with trial product including those who are not eligible for randomisation. The in-trial and on-treatment periods define the patient years of observation (PYO) and patient years of exposure (PYE), respectively, as the total time duration in the periods. 10.3 Statistical analyses If necessary, a statistical analysis plan (SAP) may be written in addition to the protocol, including a more technical and detailed elaboration of the statistical analyses. The SAP will be finalised before database lock.

If no assessments are available, the mean value at week 0 across all subjects is used as the baseline (week 0) value. 10.3.1 Primary endpoint Definition of primary endpoint: % weight change Change from baseline (randomisation/week 20) to week 68 in body weight (%) is defined as % weight change = (body weight at week 68 – body weight at baseline) body weight at baseline×100. Analyses addressing the primary estimand The following statistical analysis and impu tation methods are designed to address the primary estimand, i.e. to assess the effectiveness of semaglutide 2.4 mg. The analysis model for % weight change is a linear regression (ANCOVA) of % weight change with randomised treatment as a factor and baseline body weight (kg) as covariate. The estimated treatment difference between semaglutide 2.4 mg a nd semaglutide placebo will be reported together with the associated two-sided 95% confide nce interval (CI) and corresponding p-value. The superiority tests of semaglutide 2.4 mg vs. semaglutide placebo will be carried out as follows. Let μ semaglutide and μsemaglutide placebo denote the true mean of % weight change for semaglutide 2.4 mg and semaglutide placebo group, respectively.

Handling of missing week 68 values for the primary estimandAll available data at week 68 (AT and AD) are used and missing values (MT and MD) at week 68 will be imputed and the endpoint will be derived from the imputed values. Several approaches for imputation will be applied. First, a description of the primary imputation approach to address the primary estimand for the primary endpoint is given followed by a description of the sensitivity analyses used to assess the robustness of the pr imary analysis results. The sensitivity analyses investigate how assumptions on body weight development after discontinuation of randomised treatment impact the estimated treatment contrasts between semaglutide 2.4 mg and semaglutide placebo.

This will be done according to the timing of last available observati on (LAO) of body weight. Missing body weight measurements at week 68 for subjects on randomised treatment (MT) are imputed by sampling from available measurements at week 68 from subjects on randomised treatment (AT) in the relevant randomised treatment arm. The multiple impu tation approach is done in three steps: 1.Imputation : Defines an imputation model using retrieved subjects (AD) from FAS and done within groups defined by randomised treatment and the timing of the LAO of body weight. The model will be a linear regression of body w eight (kg) at week 68 with gender (male/female), baseline BMI (kg/m 2) (in categories 27-<35, 35-<40, ≥40) as factors and baseline (randomisation) body weight (kg) and LAO of body w eight (kg) as covariates. No interactions will be included. The grouping of timing will be done by quarters (intervals of 12 weeks for endpoints evaluating the change from randomisation, intervals of 17 weeks for endpoints evaluating the change from week 0). If timing by quarters is too restrictive, halves (intervals of 24 weeks for endpoints evaluating the change from randomisation, intervals of 34 weeks for endpoints evaluating the change from week 0) or excluding timing will be used. If any subjects are MT, an imputation model for missing body weight measurements at week 68 for MT subjects will also be defined using AT subjects in a similar way. The estimated posterior distribution for the parameters (regression coefficients and variances) in the imputation models are then used to impute missing week 68 body weight values for each randomised treatment arm. This will be done 1,000 times and results in 1,000 complete data sets. 2.Analysis : Analysis of each of the 1,000 complete data sets, using the analysis model (ANCOVA) results in 1,000 estimations. 3.Pooling : Integrates the 1,000 estimation results into a final result using Rubin’s formula. Based on NN9536-4153 phase 2 results 1,000 copies should be sufficient to establish stable results. If 1,000 copies are insufficient, 10,000 copies will be used. The multiple imputations will be generated using Novo Nordisk trial number 95364376 as seed number. Sensitivity analyses Jump to reference multiple imputation approach (J2R-MI): Missing values of body weight at week 68 (MT and MD) for both the semaglutide 2.4 mg and semaglutide placebo group are imputed by sampling among all available assessments at week 68 in the semaglutide placebo group (AT and AD). This approach makes the assumption that subjects instantly after discontinuation lose any effect of randomised treatment beyond what can be expected from semaglutide placebo treatment as  CONFIDENTIAL"

The model will be a linear regression of body weight (kg) at week 68 with gender (male/female), BMI (kg/m 2) (in categories 27-<35, 35-<40, ≥40) as factors and baseline (randomisat ion) body weight (kg) as covariate. No interactions will be included. The estimated posterior distribution for the parameters (regression coefficients and variances) in the imputation models are then used to impute missing week 68 body weight values for each randomised treatment arm. This will be done 1,000 times and results in 1,000 complete data sets. The jump to reference approach is the basis for the sample size calculations. A single imputation approach as done by Sacks 77(S1-SI and S2-SI): Missing weight measurements at week 68 for non-retrieved subjects (MD) are imputed using a weight regain rate of 0.3 kg/month after LAO but truncated at no change from baseline whenever the extrapolation would lead to a positive weight gain relative to baseline. If a subject's weight at drug discontinuation represented a gain in weight relative to baseline, no additional gain will be imputed, and the unfavourable gain is carried forward to week 68. The weight regain imputation will be done for both randomised arms (S1-SI). Additionally, a version where only the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm uses the regain rate while the semaglutide placebo arm uses last available observation (corresponding to a weight regain rate of 0 kg/month) will be performed (S2-SI). For bot h versions, missing weight measurements at week 68 for subjects on randomised treatment (MT) are imputed by using LAO. Tipping-point multiple imputation analysis (TP-MI) : First, missing data are imputed according to the primary multiple imputation approach. Second, for the semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment arm a penalty will be added to the imputed values at week 68. The approach is to gradually increase this penalty until all confirmed conclusions from the primary analysis are reversed. For each hypothesis tested the specific value of the penalty that reverses the conclusion will be used to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis results. This sens itivity analysis evaluates the robustness of the superiority conclusions. Mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) : This ‘MMRM for effectiveness’ will use all assessments regardless of adherence to randomised treatment, including assessments at week 68 for retrieved drop-outs (AD). The MMRM for effectiven ess will be fitted using the same factor and covariate as for the primary analysis all nested within visit. An unstructured covariance matrix for measurements within the same subject will be employed, assuming that measurements for different subjects are independent. CONFIDENTIAL"

The Semaglutide s.c. safety committee may recommend unblinding of any data for further analysis, and in this case an independent ad hoc group will be established in order to maintain the blinding of the trial personnel. Event adjudication committee An independent external EAC is established to perform ongoing blinded adjudication of selected types of events and deaths (see Table 9-1 and Appendix 4 ). The EAC will evaluate events sent for adjudication using pre-defined definitions and guidelines in accordance with the EAC Charter. The evaluation is based on review of pre-def ined clinical data collected by the trial sites. The EAC is composed of permanent members covering all required medical specialities. EAC members must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and must be independent of Novo Nordisk. The EAC will ha ve no authorisations to impact on trial conduct, trial protocol or amendments. The assessment made by both the EAC and the investigator will be presented in the clini cal trial report. In this trial, cardiovascular events will be adjudicated in order to adequately characterize the cardiovascular safety profile, since cardiovascular disease is an important and serious comorbidity of obesity 80. In addition, events of acute pancreatitis will be adjudicated because Novo Nordisk monitor these events closely as treatment with GLP -1 RA has been associated with acute pancreatitis.  CONFIDENTIAL"

All information supplied by Novo Nordisk in connection with this trial shall remain the sole property of Novo Nordisk and is to be considered confidential information. No confidential information shall be disclosed to others without prior written consent from Novo Nordisk. Such informat ion shall not be used except in the performance of this trial. The information obtained during this trial may be made available to other investigators who are conducting other clinical trials with the trial produ ct, if deemed necessary by Novo Nordisk. Provided that certain conditions are fulfilled, Novo Nordisk may grant access to information obtained during this trial to researchers who require access for research projects studying the same disease and/or trial product studied in this trial. Novo Nordisk may publish on its clinical trials website a redacted clinical trial report for this trial. One (or two) investigator(s) w ill be appointed by N ovo Nordisk to review and sign the clinical trial report (signatory investigator) on behalf of all participating investigators. The signatory investigator(s) will be appointed based upon the cr iteria defined by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors for research publications. 81 Communication of results Novo Nordisk commits to communicate and disclose results of trials regardless of outcome. Disclosure includes publication of a manuscript in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, abstract submission with a poster or oral presentation at a scientific meeting or disclosure by other means. The results of this trial will be subject to public disclosure on external web sites according to international and national regulations. Novo Nordi sk reserves the right to defer the release of data until specified milestones are reached, for example when the clinical trial report is available. This includes the right not to release the results of interim analyses, because the release of such information may influence the results of the entire trial. At the end of the trial, one or more scientific publications may be prepared collaboratively by the investigator(s) and Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to postpone publication and/or communication for up to 60 days to protect intellectual property. In all cases the trial results will be reported in an objective, accurate, balanced and complete manner, with a discussion of the strengths and limitations. In the event of any disagreement on the content of any publication, both the investigators’ and Novo Nordisk opinions will be fairly and sufficiently represented in the publication. CONFIDENTIAL"

Authorship of publications should be in accordance with the Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors 81. All authors will be provided with the relevant statistical tables, figures, and reports needed to evaluate the planned publication. Where required by the journal, the investigator from each trial site will be named in an acknowledgement or in the s upplementary m aterial, as specified by the journal. Site-specific publication(s) by investigator(s) For a multicentre clinical trial, analyses based on single- site data usually have significant statistical limitations and frequently do not provide meaningful information for healthcare professionals or subjects, and therefore may not be supported by Novo Nordisk. Thus, Novo Nordisk may deny a request or ask for deferment of the publication of individual site results until the primary manuscript is accepted for publication. In line with Good Publication Practice, such individual reports should not precede the primary manuscript and should always reference the primary manuscript of the trial. Investigator access to data and review of results As owner of the trial database, Novo Nordisk has the discretion to determine who will have access to the database. Individual investigators will have their own subjects' data, and will be provided with the randomisation code after results are available. 8) Dissemination of clinical trial data Information of the trial will be disclosed at clinicaltrials.gov and novonordisk-trials.com. It will also be disclosed according to other applicable requirements such as those of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) 82, the Food and Drug Administration Amendment Act (FDAAA)83, European Commission Requirements84, 85and other relevant recommendations or regulations. If a subject requests to be included in the trial via the Novo Nordisk e-mail contact at these web sites, Novo Nordisk may disclose the investigator’s contact details to the subject. As a result of increasing requirements for transparency, some countries require public disclosure of investigator names and their affiliations. The Primary Completion Date (PCD) is the last assessment of the primary endpoint, and is for this trial Last Subject First Treatment (LSFT) + 68 weeks corresponding to ‘end of tr eatment’ visit.

Events meeting the AE definition !Any abnormal laboratory test results or safety assessments, including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. !A CLAE: a clinical abnormal laboratory finding which is clinically significant, i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, for example change of medicine dose or more frequent follow-up due to the abnormality. !Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. !Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction. !Signs, symptoms or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of trial product regardless of intent. !A ""lack of efficacy"" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition. Events NOT meeting the AE definition !Pre-existing conditions, anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing conditions, including those identified during screening or other trial procedures performed before exposure to trial product. Note: pre-existing conditions should be recorded as medical history/concomitant illness. !Pre-planned procedures, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent. Definition of an SAE An SAE is an AE that fulfils at least one of the following criteria: !Results in death !Is life-threatening The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. !Requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation !Hospitalisation signifies that the subject has been detained at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalisation are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalisation or fulfils any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalisation” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. !Hospitalisation for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. Note: Hospitalisations for administrative, trial related and social purposes do not constitute AEs and should therefore not be reported as AEs or SAEs. CONFIDENTIAL"

In such cases, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. !When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory and diagnostics reports) related to the event. !There may be instances when copies of source documents (e.g. medical records) for certain cases are requested by Novo Nordisk. In such cases, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the subject number, will be redacted on the copies of the source documents before submission to Novo Nordisk. !For all non-serious AEs the applicable forms should be signed when the event is resolved or at the end of the trial at the latest. For sign-off of SAE related forms refer to “SAE reporting via paper CRF” later in this section. !Novo Nordisk products used as concomitant medication: if an AE is considered to have a causal relationship with a Novo Nordisk marketed product used as concomitant medication in the trial, it is important that the suspected relationship is reported to Novo Nordisk, e.g. in the alternative aetiology section on the safety information form. Novo Nordisk may need to report this AE to relevant regulatory authorities. Assessment of severity The investigator will assess intensity for each event reported during the trial and assign it to one of the following categories: !Mild : An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities. !Moderate : An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday activities. !Severe : An event that prevents normal everyday activities. Note: Severe is a category used for rating the intensity of an event; and both an AE and SAE can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the outcomes described in the definition of an SAE and not when it is rated as severe. Assessment of causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between trial product and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. Relationship between an AE/SAE and the relevant trial product (s) should be assessed as: !Probable - Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship. !Possible - A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed. !Unlikely - The event is most likely related to aetiology other than the trial product. Alternative aetiology, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant medication, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to trial product administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator should use the IB for the assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical records that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report. However, it is important that the investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data . The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and send a follow-up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. CONFIDENTIAL"

The human relevance of this finding is unknown. However, based on the findings in rodents, monitoring of serum calcitonin (a sensitive biomarker for C-cell activation) is currently being performed in clinical trials with semaglutide. While there is general agreement on the clinical inte rpretation of substantially elevated calcitonin levels (> 100 ng/L) as likely indicative of C-cell ne oplasia, the interpretation of values between upper normal range (5.0 and 8.4 ng/L for women and men, respectively) and 100 ng/L is less clear with regards to indication of disease. There are several known confounding factors affecting calcitonin levels, e.g.: !renal dysfunction !tobacco use !autoimmune thyroiditis !several drug classes (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, beta-blockers, H 2-blockers and glucocorticoids) Physiology of C-cell activation in various clinical c onditions and in different patient po pulations (i.e. with various comorbidities) is poorly understood. There may be various clinical conditions not identified so far which mildly or moderately affect calcitonin secretion by C-cells. Calcitonin monitoring A blood sample will be drawn at pre-specif ied trial visits for measurement of calcitonin.

For classification and further details of the risks, please refer to the current version of the IB or any updates hereof. The identified/potential risks are base d on findings in non-clinical studies and clinical trials with semaglutide as well as other GLP-1 RAs. For each of these risks, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial. Identified risks !Gastrointestinal adverse events Consistent with findings with other GLP-1 RAs, the most frequently reported adverse events (AE) in clinical trials with semaglutide were gastrointestinal AEs. A low starting dose and dose escalation steps will be implemented in the trial to mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs. Potential risks !Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) (based on non-clinical data) Expected proliferative thyroid C-cell changes were seen in the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies after daily exposure to semaglutide for 2 years. No hyperplasia was observed in monkeys after 52 weeks exposure up to 13-fold above the clinical plasma exposure at 2.4 mg/week. In clinical trials with semaglutide, there have been no reports of MTC or clinically relevant changes in calcitonin levels. The C-cell changes in rodents are mediated by the GLP-1 receptor, which is not expressed in the normal human thyroid. Accordingly, the risk of GLP-1 receptor-mediated C- cell changes in humans is considered to be low. However, as a precaution, exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to medical history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) or MTC and elevated plasma levels of calcitonin (biomarker for MTC) have been implemented in the trial. Other risks !Pregnancy and fertility (based on non-clinical data) Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. There are limited data from the use of semaglutide in pregnant women. Therefore, semaglutide should not be used during pregnancy. Exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to pregnancy have been implemented in the trial. 2.4 Section 4.1.3 Exploratory objectives The primary estimand will cover all effect-related objectives except the secondary objective addressing ‘Effect-related: week 0 to week 68’. 2.5 Section 4.2.2.2 Supportive secondary endpoints Safety endpoints from randomisation (week 20) to week 75 Number of treatment-emergent AEs Number of serious adverse events (SAEs) CONFIDENTIAL"
