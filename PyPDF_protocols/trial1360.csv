Overall Design This is a sin gle group , open -label study of the impact of PI3Kδ inhibitor INCB050465 on signs and symptoms of SS. Twelve participants meeting the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled. Participants will receive treatment with INCB0504 65 QD for 12 weeks and undergo ultrasound measurement of salivary glands, measurements of salivary flow, collection of symptom questionnaires, and PD blood sampling to allow studies of cytokine levels, gene expression levels, and other PD marke rs. Participants will have regularly scheduled study visits at screening, Day 1 ( baseline; first day of dose administration), and at the end of Weeks 4, 8 and 12, where laboratory and other assessments will be performed. There will also be a laboratory-only visit at the end of Week 2 to collect safety laboratory assessments . Participants will complete questionnaires regarding signs and symptoms of disease at each study visit. Ultrasound measurement of the parotid and submandibular glands will be performed on Day 1 (before the first dose) and after 4 and 12 weeks of treatment. Ultrasound of glands will be performed in the longitudinal and transverse planes with participants in a supine position. The ultrasound images will be evaluated for quality then transmitted to a central vendor for reading and data summarization. The echostructure of each gland on B- mode images will be grad ed on a 5-point scale (0 to 4): • Grade 0 : normal homogeneous gland. • Grade 1 : small hypoecho ic areas with hyperechoic bands. • Grade 2 : multiple hypoecho ic areas less than 2 mm . • Grade 3 : multiple hypoechoic areas 2 to 6 mm. • Grade 4 : multiple hypoechoic areas larger than 6 mm. For each timepoint, 4 grades will be obtained, one for each parotid and submandibular gland. The SGUS score is the numeric sum of the 4 individual grades (maximum score of 16). Instructions for conducting and transmitting ultrasound measurements will be provided in the Study M anual. CONFIDENTIAL"
24,page_24,"Incyte Corporation Page 25 of 65 Protocol INCB 50465- 207 Version 0 12 JUN 2018 Stimulated and unstimulated salivary flow will be performed at baseline and after 4, 8 , and 12 weeks of treatment. Instructions for performing salivary flow measurements will be provided in the Study M anual. PJP prophylaxis: Prior treatment with prednisone or equivalent may represent a risk factor for PJP in combination with other immunosuppressants. Participants who have received prednisone ≥ 20 mg per day (or equivalent) within 60 days before baseline are excluded. Participants receiving ≥ 10 mg to < 20 mg of prednisone (or equivalent) may be a t increased risk for PJP , and prophylaxis should be considered for these participants, particularly if they have a history of PJP or have recently received any immunosuppressive therapy that may represent and increased risk. Participants receiving < 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent have some potential risk. PJP prophylaxis is not required for these participants but should be considered by the investigator only in exceptional circumstances in consultation with the medical monitor as needed. Examples of st andard PJP prophylaxis therapies include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, atovaquone, dapsone with or without pyrimethamine, and pentamidine ( Baden et al 2012). Due to reports of cross-sensitivity between sulfonamides and dapsone, all participants who have a known or suspected allergy to sulfonamides must receive either inhaled pentamidine or atovaquone for PJP prophylaxis. Prophylaxis should be given while participants are receiving study drug and should continue for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug. In addition to these study visits, there will be laboratory-only visits at the end of Week 2 to collect safety laboratory assessments . Week 12 will correspond to the EOT. A safety follow up visit will occur 30 (+7) days after the last dose of study drug. 4.2. Overall Study Duration Individual participant s will participate for a duration of up to 21 weeks (4 weeks screening, 12 weeks treatment, 4 -5 weeks safety follow-up; s ee Figure 1). The study begins when the first participant signs the ICF. The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study . A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all study visits , including the follow- up visit. The investigator will be expected to monitor for and report any SAEs, AEs of special interest, and pregnancies as detailed in Section 9. The remain ing participants are considered to be on study until a discontinuation criterion is met and written notification is provided to the sponsor. 4.3. Study Termination The investigator retains the right to terminate study participation at any time, according to the terms specified in the study contract . The investigator is to notify the IRB /IEC in writing of the study's completion or early termination, send a copy of the notification to the sponsor or sponsor' s designee, and retain 1 copy for the site study regulat ory file. The sponsor may terminate the study electively, or if required by regulatory agency . If the study is terminated prematurely, the sponsor or designee will notify the investigators, the IRBs and IECs, and regulatory bodies of the decision and reason for termination of the study.

Study Treatment Administered Information regarding study drug and administration is provided in Table 7. Participants will record study drug administration daily in a diary. Table 7: Study Treatment Information Study treatment name: INCB050465 Dose formulation: Tablet Unit dose str ength/ dose level: Route of administration: Oral Administration instructions: INCB050465 will be taken QD, orally with water and without regard to food. Packaging and labeling: INCB050465 will be packaged in high -density polyethylene bottles. Storage: Ambient (15°C -30°C/59°F-86°F) 6.2. Preparation , Handling , and Accountability Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study treatment , and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study treatmen t. All study treatment must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. The investigator (or designee) is responsible for study t reatment accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). Inventory and accountability records must be maintained and readily available for inspection by the study monitor and are open to inspection at any time by any applicable regulatory authorities . The investigator or designee must maintain records that document: • Delivery of study drug to the study site. • Inventory of study drug at the site. • Participant use of the study drug, including pill count from each supply dispensed. • Return of study drug to the investigator or designee by participants. The investigational product must be used only in accordance with the Protocol. The investigator will also maintain records adequately documenting that the participants were provided the specified study drug. These records should include dates, quantities, and any available batch or serial numbers or unique code numbers assigned to the investigational product and study participants. Completed accou ntability records will be archived by the site . The investigator or designee will be expected to collect and retain all used, unused, and partially used containers of study drug until verified by the study monitor (unless otherwise agreed to by the sponsor). At the CONFIDENTIAL"

If local procedures mandate o n-site destruction of investigational supply, the site should (where local procedures allow) maintain the investigational supply until the study monitor inspects the accountability records in order to evaluate compliance and accuracy of accountability by t he investigative site . At sites where the study drug is destroyed before monitor inspection, the monitors rely on documentation of destruction per the site SOP. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study treatments are provided in the study materials provided to sites. 6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding Not applicable. 6.4. Study Treatment Compliance Compliance with study drug should be emphasized to the participant by the site personnel, and appropriate steps should be taken to optimize compliance during the study . Compliance with INCB050465 will be calculated by the sponsor based on the drug accountability documented by the site staff and monitored by the sponsor/designee (tablet counts). Participants will be instructed to bring all study drug with them to the study visits in order for site personnel to conduct tablet counts to assess study drug accountability. The drug accountability documentation will be used by the sponsor to calculate treatment complian ce. 6.5. Dose Modificat ions 6.5.1. Management of Urgent Toxicities Investigators may employ any measures or concomitant medications necessary to optimally treat the participant after discussion with the sponsor (whenever possible). 6.5.2. Criteria and Procedures for Dose I nterruptions and Adjustments of Study Drug Safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study treatment. There are no dose modifications in this study. In some circumstances, it may be necessary to temporarily interrupt treatment with INCB050465 as a result of AEs or laboratory abnormalities that have an unclear relationship to the study drug (see Table 8) . Except in cases of emergency, it is recommended that any laboratory findings be confirmed and that the investigator consult with the sponsor 's medical monitor (or other representative of the sponsor) before temporarily interrupting study drug. Particip ants who experience a recurrence of the AEs or laboratory abnormalities upon restarting the study drug may have the study drug permanently discontinued. Instructions for dose interruptions for INCB050465 are outlined in Table 8. Individual decisions regarding dose interruptions should be made using clinical judgment in consultation with the medical monitor (whenever possible), taking into account relatedness of the AE to the study treatment and the participant's und erlying condition. Adverse events that have a clear alternative explanation, or transient (≤ 72 hours) abnormal laboratory values without associated clinically CONFIDENTIAL"

Step 2: Restart study drug and monitor as clinically indicated. • Any recurrent Grade 3 toxicity after dose restart . Discontinue study drug administration and follow -up per Protocol. • Any other Grade 4 toxicity. Discontinue study drug administration and follow -up per Protocol. 6.5.3. Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of INCB050465 The occurrence of unacceptable toxicity not caused by the underlying disease will be presumed to be relat ed to study drug treatment and will require that the study drug be permanently discontinued. Unacceptable toxicity is defined as follows: • Occurrence of an AE that is related to treatment with the study drug that, in the judgment of the investigator or the sponsor' s medical monitor, compromise s the participant's ability to continue study-specific procedures or is considered to not be in the participant ’s best interest. • Persistent AE requiring a delay of therapy for more than 2 weeks without resolution of the AE. A greater treatment delay requires approval by the sponsor 's medical monitor. 6.6. Concomitant Medications and Procedures All concomitant medications and treatments (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, vaccines, and/or herbal supplements) must be recorded in the eCRF. Any prior medication received up to 28 days before the first dose of study treatment and 30 days after the last dose of study treatment will be recorded in the eCRF.

Any addition, deletion, or change in the dose of these medications will also be recorded. Concomitant medications administered after 30 days after the last dose of study treatment should be recorded for SAEs as defined in Section 9.3. Concomitant treatments/procedures that are required to manage a participant's medical condi tion during the study will also be recorded in the eCRF. The medical monitor should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy. 6.6.1. Permitted Medications and Procedures 6.6.1.1. Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis jirovecii Pneumonia Prior treatment with prednisone or equivalent may represent a risk factor for PJP in combination with other immunosuppressants. Participants who have received prednisone ≥ 20 mg per day (or equivalent) within 60 days before baseline are excluded. Participants receiving ≥ 10 to < 20 mg of prednisone (or equivalent) may be at increased risk for PJP, and prophylaxis should be considered for these participants , particularly if they have a history of PJP or have recently received any immunosuppressive therapy that may represent an increased risk. Participants receiving < 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent have some potential risk; however, PJP prophylaxis is not generally required for these participants and should be considered only in exceptional circumstances and in consultation with the medical monitor as needed. Examples of standard PJP prophylaxis therapies include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, atovaquone, dapsone with or without pyrimethamine, and pentamidine ( Baden et al 2012). Due to reports of cross-sensitivity between sulfonamides and dapsone, all participants who have a known or suspected allergy to sulfonamides must receive either inhaled pentamidine or atovaquone for PJP prophylaxis. Prophylaxis should be given while participa nts are receiving study drug and should continue for at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug. 6.6.1.2. Nonprescription Therapies for Sjögren's Syn drome Use of nutraceuticals, ayurvedic, herbal, and other nonprescription therapies used for SS are permitte d with investigator review provided the participant has been taking the therapy for at least 60 days as a stable regimen and agrees to continue taking the same preparation at the same dose during the course of the study. 6.6.2. Restricted Medications and Procedur es • Inducers of CYP3A4 ( see Study Manual ) are discouraged, and investigators should seek other options if available. • Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors ( see Study Manual ) are discouraged, and investigators should seek other options if available. • Administration of g lucocorticoids at doses of 20 mg or less must be stable within 30 days of Day 1 and be anticipated to remain stable throughout the 12- week study assessment period. CONFIDENTIAL"

Discontinuation of Study Treatment 7.1.1. Reasons for Discontinuation Participants must be discontinued from study treatment for the following reasons: • The participant becomes pregnant. • Consent is withdrawn. Note: Consent withdrawn means that the participant has explicitly indicated that they do not want to be followed any longer; in this case no f urther data, except data in public domain, may be solicited from or collected on the participant. • Further participation would be injurious to the participant's health or well- being , in the investigator 's medical judgment. • Unacceptable toxicity as noted in Section 6.5.3. • The study is terminated by the sponsor. • The study is terminated by the local health authority, IRB, or IEC. A participant may be discontinued from study treatment as follows: • If, during the course of the study, a participant is found not to have met eligibility criteria, the medical monitor, in collaboration with the investigator, will determine whether the participant should be withdrawn from study treatment. • If a participant is noncompliant with study procedures or study drug administration in the investigator 's opinion, the sponsor should be consulted for instruction on handling the participant. 7.1.2. Discontinuation Procedures In the event that the decision is made to permanently discontinue the study treatment , the EOT visit should be conducted. Reasonable efforts should be made to have the participant return for a follow-up visit. These visits are described in Table 3 and Table 4. The last date of the last dose of study drug(s)/treatment and the reason for discontinuation of study treatment will be recorded in the eCRF. If a participant is discontinued from study treatment: • The study monitor or sponsor must be notified. • The reason(s) for withdrawal must be documented in the participant' s medical record and the primary reason for withdrawal must be included in the eCRF. • The EOT visit should be performed. • The date of the EOT visit should be recorded in the e CRF . CONFIDENTIAL"
35,page_35,"Incyte Corporation Page 36 of 65 Protocol INCB 50465- 207 Version 0 12 JUN 2018 • Participants must be followed for safety until the time of the follow -up visit or until study drug–related toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, whichever is longest. If the participant discontinues study treatment and actively withdr aws consent for collection of follow-up data (safety follow-up) then no additional data collection should occur; however, participants will have the option of withdrawing consent for study treatment but continuing in the follow-up period of the study for s afety assessments. 7.2. Participant Withdrawal From the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. See Table 3 and Table 4 for data to be collected at the time of s tudy discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 7.3. Lost to Follow -Up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he/ she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site . The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit: • The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study. • Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to r egain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant 's last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant 's medical record. • Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study.

Screening Procedures Screening is the interval between signing the ICF and the day the participant is enrolled in the study (Day 1). Screening may not exceed 28 days . Assessments that are required to demonstrate eligibility may be performed over the course of 1 or more days during the screening process. Procedures conducted as part of the participant' s routine clinical manag ement (eg, blood count, imaging study) and obtained before signing of informed consent may be used for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure meets the Protocol- defined criteria and has been performed in the timeframe of the study (ie, within 28 days of Day 1) . For participants who are enroll ed in the study, information associated with eligibility requirements must be entered into the appropriate eCRF pages. Results from the screening visit evaluations will be reviewed to confirm eligibility before enrollment or the administration of study drug. Tests with results that fail eligibility requirements may be repeated once during screening if the investigator believes the results to be in error. For screening assessments that are repeated, the most recent available result before treatment assignment will be used to determine eligibility . Treatment should start as soon as possible, but within 3 days after the date of enrollment. See Section s 5.4 and 5.5 for information regarding screen failures and replacement of participants, respectively. 8.1.3. Interactive Response Technology Procedure Each participant will be identified in the study by a participant ID number, wh ich is a combination of the site ID and participant number. Site staff should contact the IRT to obtain the participant ID number during screening. Upon determining that the participant is eligible for study entry, the IRT will be contacted to obtain the study medication bottle or kit assignment. Additionally, the IRT will be contacted at each regular study visit to update the study drug supply. Additional details are provided in the IRT manual. 8.1.4. Distribution of Reminder Cards and/or Diaries Participants will be provided with a reminder card on Day 1 and Week s 2, 4, and 8. The reminder card will indicate the date/time of the next visit and will also remind the participant that they should not take their morning dose of study drug on the day of each study visit as they will take it after blood draws for safety evaluation have been completed . The reminder cards for each visit will have an area on which the date and time of the last dose taken (from the previous evening) and the time of their last meal befo re the visit should be recorded. Participants will also be provided with a diary on Day 1 in order to record study drug administration daily . The date and time of the last dose of study drug will be recorded in the diary and eCRF. Daily study drug administration (see Section 6.1) will also be recorded in the diary. CONFIDENTIAL"

Patient -Reported Outcomes Patient -reported outcome instruments will be given to participant s for completion at study visits indicated in Table 3. Site staff will enter completed questionnaires into the eCRF database. 8.2.4.1. Dryness Questionnaire The d ryness questionnaire will ask participants to r ate the dryness of eyes, mouth, or vagina (female participants only) with 24-hour recall using an 11- point numerical rating system ranging from 0 (n o dryness) to 10 ( worst imaginable ; see Appendix B ). 8.2.4.2. EULAR Sj ögren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index The ESSPRI consists of 3 items, each with a 0 (no symptom) to 10 (maximum imaginable symptom) scale. The 3 items are dryness, fatigue, and pain. Th e recall period is 2 weeks. 8.2.4.3. Patient Global Impression of Change Questi onnaire The PGIC asks a single question regarding how the patient is feeling since beginning new therapy. The questionnaire uses a 7 point scale ranging from "" very much worse"" to "" very much improved,"" with the midpoint as no change. 8.2.4.4. Female Sexual Function Index The FSFI is a brief, self -report measure of female sexual function (female participants only). The questionnaire contains 19 items covering 6 domains of sexual function.

40,page_40,"Incyte Corporation Page 41 of 65 Protocol INCB 50465- 207 Version 0 12 JUN 2018 8.3.1. Adverse Events Adverse events will be monitored from the time the participant signs the ICF until at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug . Adverse events that begin or worsen after informed consent should be recorded on the Adverse Events F orm in the eCRF regardless of the assumption of a causal relationship with the study drug. Conditions that were already present at the time of informed consent should be recorded on the Medical History F orm in the eCRF . Adverse events (including laboratory abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible rather than by individual underlying signs and symptoms. Adverse events will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant 's legally authorized repre sentative) . The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following-up on AEs that are serious, considered related to the s tudy treatment/procedures, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study drug. Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant, such as ""How are you feelin g?"" is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences . Adverse events may also be detected when they are volunteered by the participant during the screening process or between visits, or through physical examinations, laboratory tests, or other asse ssments. The definition, reporting, and recording requirements for AEs are described in Section 9. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed u ntil resolution, sta bilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). 8.3.2. Physical Examinations Physical examinations will be conducted at the timepoints listed in Table 3. A comprehensive physical examination will include height and body weight and assessment of the following organ or body systems: skin; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; thyroid; lungs; cardiovascular system; abd omen (liver, spleen); extremities; and lymph nodes. A brief neurological examination will also be performed. A targeted physical examination should be conducted as indicated by symptoms reported by the participant, AEs, or other findings. Abnormalities t hat are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator are to be reported as AEs. Physical examinations must be performed by a medically qualified individual such as a licensed physician, physician's assistant, or an advanced registered nurse practitioner, as local law permits . 8.3.3.

Abnormal vital sign results identified after the first dose of study treatment constitute an AE if they are considered clinically meaningful, induce clinical signs or sympto ms, or require concomitant therapy . 8.3.4. Electrocardiograms Single 12-lead ECG s will be obtained as outlined in the SoA ( see Table 3 ) using an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals . All 12 -lead ECGs will be performed as indicated in Table 9 with the participant in a recumbent or semirecumbent position after 5 minutes of rest. The 12- lead ECGs will be interpreted by the investigator at the site to be used for immediate participant management and care. Additional 12- lead ECGs may be performed as clinically indicated to manage participant safety . The decision to include or exclude a participant or withdraw a participant from the study treatment based on an ECG flagged as ""Abnormal, Clinically Significant "" is the responsibility of the investigator, in consultation with the sponsor' s medical monitor, as appropriate. Clinically notable abnormalities that are considered clinically significant in the judgment of the investigator are to be reported as AEs.

End of Treatment If a decision is made that the participant permanently discontinues stud y drug ( early termination) or has completed the Protocol-specified duration of treatment, then an EOT visit should be conducted. If the EOT visit coincides with a regular study visit, the EOT evaluations will supersede those of that scheduled visit, and the data should be entered in the EOT visit in the eCRF. The participant should be encouraged to return for the safety follow-up visits. 8.7. Safety Follow -Up The safety follow -up period is the interval between the EOT visit and the scheduled follow-up visit, w hich should occur 30 to 37 days after the EOT visit (or after the last dose of study drug/treatment if the EOT visit was not performed . Adverse events and SAEs must be reported up until at least 30 days after the last dose of study drug, the date of the fo llow-up visit, or until toxicities resolve, return to baseline, or are deemed irreversible, whichever is longer . Reasonable efforts should be made to have the participant return for the follow -up visit and report any AEs that may occur during this period. 9. ADVERSE EVENTS: DEFINITIONS AND PROCEDURES FOR RECORDING, EVALUATING, FOLLOW-UP, AND REPORTING 9.1. Definition of Adverse Event Adverse Event Definition • An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug- related. • An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study treatment. Events Meeting the A dverse Event Definition • Any safety assessments (eg ECG, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying dise ase). • Abnormal laboratory test results constitute an AE if they are considered clinically meaningful, induce clinical signs or symptoms, require concomitant therapy, or require changes in study drug. Whenever possible, a diagnosis (eg, anemia, thrombocytopenia) should be recorded in the eCRF rather than the abnormal lab result (eg, low hemoglobin, platelet count decreased). • Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the con dition. • New conditions detected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though they may have been present before the start of the study. CONFIDENTIAL"
46,page_46,"Incyte Corporation Page 47 of 65 Protocol INCB 50465- 207 Version 0 12 JUN 2018 • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction. • Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication . Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose ta ken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses shoul d be reported regardless of sequelae. Events NOT Meeting the A dverse Event Definition • Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments that are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the inves tigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. • The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant 's condition or considered to be treatment -related by the investigator. • Efficacy endpoints as outlined in Section 3 will not be reported as AE/SAEs, specifically, any event that is related to disease progression of the cancer under study. Unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data will be monitored to ensure the safety of the participant s in the study. Any suspected endpoint that upon review is not progression of the cancer under study will be forwarded to Incyte Pharmacovigilance as a SAE within 24 hours of determination that the event is not progression of the cancer under study. • Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE if it occurre d after signing informed consent . If present before entering the study, the condition should be captured as medical history. • Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). • Anticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 9.2. Definition of S erious Adverse Event If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease). A Serious Adverse Event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a. Results in death b. Is life -threatening The term 'life-threatening ' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an adverse drug experience that places the participant, in the opinion of the initial reporter, at immediate risk of death from the adverse experience as it occurred. This does not include an adverse drug experience that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death . c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician' s office or outpatient setting . Complications that occur during hospitalization are A Es. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether "" hospitalization "" occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. CONFIDENTIAL"
47,page_47,"Incyte Corporation Page 48 of 65 Protocol INCB 50465- 207 Version 0 12 JUN 2018 Hospitalization for elective treatm ent of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person 's ability to conduct normal life functions. • This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance , such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) , that may interfere with or prevent everyd ay life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f. Other situations (Important Medical Event) An event that may not result in death, be immediately life -threatening, or require hospitalization, but may be considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the participant and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the above definition. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers (excluding the disease[s] under study in oncology protocols) , intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or develo pment of drug dependency or drug abuse. 9.3. Recording and Follow -Up of Adverse Events and/or S erious Adverse Event s Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Recording • An AE/SAE that begins or worsens after informed consent is signed should be recorded on the Adverse Event Form in the eCRF . Conditions that were present at the time informed consent was given should be recorded on the Medical History Form in the eCRF. • When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. • The investigator (or delegate) will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF. • It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant 's medical records in lieu of completing the AE eCRF page. • There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission. • The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information . Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs /symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. When a clear diagnosis cannot be identified, each sign or symptom should be reported as a separate AE /SAE . To the extent possible, each AE /SAE should be evaluated to determine: • The severity grade (CTCAE Grade 1 to 5). See below for further instructions on the assessment of intensity. • Whether there is at least a reasonable possibility that the AE is related to the study drug: suspected (yes) or not suspected (no). Se e below for further instructions on the asse ssment of causality. • The start and end dates, unless unresolved at final follow -up. • The action taken with regard to study drug as a result of the AE/SAE (s). CONFIDENTIAL"
48,page_48,"Incyte Corporation Page 49 of 65 Protocol INCB 50465- 207 Version 0 12 JUN 2018 • The event outcome (eg, not recovered/not resolved, recovered/resolved, recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae, fatal, unknown). • The seriousness, as per the SAE definition provided in Section 9.2. • The action taken with regard to the event. Note: If an AE is treated with a concomitant medicatio n or nondrug therapy, this action should be recorded on Adverse Event Form and the treatment should be specified on the appropriate eCRF (eg, Prior/Concomitant Medications , Procedures and Non- Drug Therapy). Assessment of Intensity The severity of AEs wil l be assessed using CTCAE v4.03 Grades 1 through 5. If an event is not classified by CTCAE, the severity of the AE will be graded according to the scale below to estimate the grade of severity: The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the following categories: • Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; treatment not indicated. • Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive trea tment indicated; limiting age appropriate activities of daily living. • Grade 3: Severe or medical significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care activities of da ily living. • Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences; urgent treatment indicated. • Grade 5: Fatal. Assessment of Causality • The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study treatment and each occurrence of each AE/SAE . • A ""reasonable possibility "" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than that a relationship cannot be ruled out. • The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. • The i nvestigator will also consult the RSI in the IB and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. • Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study treatment administration , will be considered and investigated. • For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. • With regard to assessi ng causality of SAEs: − There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report. However, the causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting r equirements. Therefore, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE. − The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send a follow-up SAE report with the updated causality assessment. CONFIDENTIAL"
49,page_49,"Incyte Corporation Page 50 of 65 Protocol INCB 50465- 207 Version 0 12 JUN 2018 Follow -Up of A dverse Events and S erious Adverse Events • The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medical ly indicated or as requested by the sponsor to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health c are professionals. • If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow-up period, the investigator will provide the sponsor with a copy of any postmortem findings, including histopathology. • New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed e CRF. • Any updated SAE data will be submit ted to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of receipt of the information. • Once an AE is detected, it should be followed until it has resolved or until it is judged to be permanent; assessment should be made at each visit (or more frequently if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat the event, and the outcome. • When the severity of an AE changes over time for a reporting period (eg, between visits), each change in severity will be reported as a separate AE until the event resolves. 9.4. Reporting of S erious Adverse Events All SAEs , regardless of suspected causality (eg, relationship to study drug, or study procedure[s]) , occurring after the participant has signed the ICF through the last study vis it or 30 + 7 days after the last dose of study drug , whichever occurs lat er, must be reported to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of learning of i ts occurrence, unless otherwise specified by the Protocol. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE information after c onclusion of the study participation . However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must notify the sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event. After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. If the SAE is not documented in the IB for the study drug (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the sponsor's study drug, the sponsor or its designee may urgently require further information from the investigator for reporting to health authorities . The sponsor or its designee may nee d to issue an Investigator Notification to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same drug that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and re levant ethics committees in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC, or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries.

The sponsor will comply with country- specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/IEC , and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected adverse reactions according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety information (eg summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the Investigator's Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. Serious Adverse Event Reporting • Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Adverse Event Form in the eCRF . • The investigator must also complete the Incyte Serious Adverse Event Report Form, in English. Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Serious Adverse Event Repo rt Form. • Facsimile or email transmission of the Serious Adverse Event Report Form is the preferred method to transmit this information to Pharmacovigilance/designee (eg, C3i/Telerx) . The contact information of the sponsor's study- specific representatives is listed in the Study Manual provided to each site. The original copy of the Serious Adverse Event Report Form and the confirmation sheet must be kept at the study site. • • Follow-up information is recorded on an amended or new Serious Adverse Event Report Form, with an indication that it is follow -up to the previously reported SAE and the date of the original report. The follow-up report should include information that was not provided on the previous Serious Adverse Event Report Form, such as the outcome of the event (eg, resolved or ongoing), treatment provided, action taken with study drug because of the SAE (eg, dose reduced, interrupted, or discontinued), or participant disposition (eg, continued or withdrew from study participation) . Each recurrence , complication, or progression of the original event should be reported as follow- up to that event, regardless of when it occurs. • In rare circumstances, and in the absence of facsimile or computer equipment, notification by telephone is acceptable with a copy of the Incyte Serious Adverse Event Report Form sent by overnight mail or courier service. Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and sign the Serious Adverse Event Report Form within the designated reporting time frames. • Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Study Manual. 9.5.

Pregnancy Pregnancy, in and of itself, is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that study dr ug may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication or method . When a pregnancy has been confirmed in a participant during maternal or paternal exposure to study drug, the following procedures should be followed in order to ensure safety: • The study drug m ust be discontinued immediately. • The investigator must complete and submit the Incyte Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form to the sponsor or its designee within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy. Data on fetal outcome are collected for regulatory reporting and drug safety evaluation. Follow-up should be conducted for each pregnancy to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications, by following until the first well-baby visit. Pregnancy should be recorded on a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form and reported by the investigator to the sponsor or its designee. Pregnancy follow-up information should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible causal relationship to the sponsor's study drug to any pregnancy outcome, as well as follow- up to the first well- baby visit or the duration specified in local regul ations, whichever is later . Refer to the Incyte Reference Guide for Completing the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form. Any SAE occurring during pregnancy of a study participant must be recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form and submitted to the sponsor or designee. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg, spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, or ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs (if occurring in the study participant) and must be reported as described in Section 9.4. If an abnormal pregnancy outcome is reported in a study participant's partner, the event should be reported to the sponsor on the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Form. 9.8. Warnings and Precautions Special warnings or precaution s for the study drug , derived from safety information collected by the sponsor or its designee, are presented in the IB. Additional safety information collected between IB updates will be communicated in the form of Investigator Not ifications . Any important new safety information should be discussed with the participant during the study, as necessary . If new significant risks are identified, they will be added to the ICF. 9.9.

INFORMATION REGARDING EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTRACEPTIVE METHOD S For male participants in the study: Male participants should use a condom during treatment and through 90 days after the end of systemic exposure. If the male participant has a partner that is of child -bearing potential, the partner should also use contraception through 93 days after the end of relevant systemic exposure. In addition, male participants must refrain from donating sperm during the study through 90 days after the end of relevant systemic exposure. Males who have had a vasectomy qualify as having met the requirement for a highly effective birth control method. For female participants in the study: The following methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly are considered as highly effective birth control methods: • Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationa − oral − intravaginal − transdermal • Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationa − oral − injectable − implantableb • Intrauterine deviceb • Intrauterine hormone- releasing systemb • Bilateral tubal occlusionb • Vasectomi zed partnerb c • Sexual abstinenced Acceptable birth control methods that result in a failure rate of more than 1% per year include: • Progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception, where inhibition of ovulation is not the primary mode of action • Male or female condom with or without spermicidee • Cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicidee • Tubal ligation a Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the investigational medicinal product, which may reduce the efficacy of the contraception method. b Contraception methods that in the context of this guidance are considered to have low user dependency. c Vasectomized partner is a highly effective method of avoiding pregnancy provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential study participant and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the surgical success. d In the co ntext of this guidance, sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. e A combination of male condom with either cap, diaphragm or sponge with spermicide (double barrier methods) are also considered acceptable, but not highly effective, birth control methods.
