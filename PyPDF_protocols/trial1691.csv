The course of PsA is usually characterized by flares and remissions. 1 Left untreated, patients with PsA can have persistent inflammation, progressive joint damage, disability, and a reduced life expectancy.1,2 Patients with PsA experience varying combinations of disease manifestations affecting the synovium, tendons, entheses, skin, and bone. These manifestations of disease range in prevalence, with peripheral arthritis and variable degrees of psoriasis observed in all patients at some point during their disease course, axial disease in 40% to 74% depending on the criteria used for diagnosis, 3enthesitis in 25% to 51%, dactylitis in 8% to 59%4-6and anterior uveitis in 2% to 25%.7 Additionally, patients with PsA are more likely to experience the co-morbid conditions of cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes, fatty liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, kidney disease, osteoporosis, fibromyalgia, 8depression, and anxiety than healthy subjects,9and have decreased quality of life and functional impairment.10,11 Patients with PsA require treatment of the entire spectrum of disease manifestations. The primary goal of treating patients with PsA is to maximize long-term health-related quality of life, through control of symptoms, prevention of structural damage, normalization of function and social participation, and abrogation of inflammation. Initial treatment of musculoskeletal symptoms consists of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and local corticosteroid injections, while topical therapies are used for the initial treatment of psoriasis. For patients who experience lack of efficacy or toxicity with these measures, for the treatment of peripheral arthritis, both the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 12and Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA)13 recommend systemic therapy with conventional synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) (methotrexate [MTX], leflunomide [LEF], sulfasalazine [SSZ], or ciclosporin A), followed by anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy in patients who do not respond adequately to csDMARDs. Other biologic therapies (e.g., Interleukin[IL]-12/23 or IL-17 inhibitors) are also recommended as alternatives to anti-TNF inhibitors in selected patients with PsA. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors are also now available to treat PsA. Additional specific recommendations differ slightly between EULAR and GRAPPA, however recommendations for therapeutic choice are made based on a patient's clinical presentation as some manifestations of PsA, such as enthesitis, dactylitis, and axial disease are either not responsive or poorly responsive to csDMARDs. Specific therapeutic options are also recommended for treatment of skin disease. 12,13 Despite the beneficial results achieved with currently available biologic agents, approximately 40% of patients do not achieve at least 20% improvement in American College of Rheumatology (ACR) scores, 12,14-20and only 58%21to 61%22of patients with PsA are able to achieve clinical remission after 1 year of treatment. Only approximately 43% achieve sustained remission for at least 1 year as measured by minimal disease activity (MDA). 23 Thus, there remains a clear medical need for additional therapeutic options in PsA for patients with inadequate response to or intolerance to currently available therapies.

IL-23 plays a critical role in the differentiation and function of T helper (Th) 17 cells, which have emerged as an important T-cell subpopulation involved in the pathogenesis of immune mediated disorders.24 The therapeutic rationale for an IL-23 antagonist in inflammatory diseases such as psoriasis (PsO), Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), and PsA is supported by several lines of evidence. IL-23 knockout mice are resistant to experimental arthritis, experimental autoimmune encephalitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. 25-27 Blocking IL-23 with an antagonistic antibody reduced the inflammatory response seen in mouse models of autoimmune encephalitis, colitis, and ovalbumin challenge.28-30 Genome-wide association studies have demonstrated associations between polymorphisms of the gene for IL-23, or the gene for its receptor, and the diseases PsO, CD, UC, and PsA. 31-34 In addition, excessive expression of IL-23 has been reported in affected skin in PsO, in the gut mucosa in CD, and in the synovial tissue of subjects with PsA. 35-37 This study is being conducted to evaluate the treatment of moderately to severely active PsA. The subject population will consist of no more than 50% of subjects with a demonstrated inadequate response (lack of efficacy after a minimum 12 week duration of therapy) or intolerance to 1 or 2 biologic therapies (Bio IR). The remaining study population will be subjects who have a demonstrated inadequate response (lack of efficacy after a minimum 12 week duration of therapy) or intolerance to at least 1 csDMARD (csDMARD-IR). A previous clinical study suggested that risankizumab 150 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and every 12 weeks (q12w) thereafter is effective in the treatment of PsA. Clinical Hypothesis Risankizumab will provide better efficacy compared to placebo and will be well tolerated in subjects with moderately to severely active PsA who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to biologic therapy and/or csDMARD therapy. 2.2 Benefits and Risks to Subjects Despite the availability of various PsA therapies, many subjects still do not respond adequately to these treatments, or gradually lose response over time. Risankizumab is an antagonist specific for IL-23 which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Nonclinical studies have shown that risankizumab has minimal inhibitory effects on IL-12, the inhibition of which has been associated with increased risk of serious infections. 38,39 Selective IL-23 inhibition may not increase risk of serious infection, including mycobacterial infections.40 Interleukin-23 inhibition is not known to increase the risk of tuberculosis (TB) infection or impair the response to TB infection in animal models. 41,42 Thus, low-risk subjects with positive QuantiFERON testing do not need to be treated with anti-TB therapy prior to receiving risankizumab, but should be carefully monitored for any sign of TB reactivation. Absence of TB reactivation despite not receiving anti-TB prophylaxis will provide important information in humans as to whether TB testing is required prior to treatment with risankizumab. Efficacy of risankizumab for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis was demonstrated in four Phase 3, randomized, placebo- and/or active-comparator (adalimumab or ustekinumab) controlled Page 9 of 128"

Risankizumab response rates were consistent across all 4 studies: 72% to 75% of subjects achieved 90% reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI 90), and 84% to 88% achieved sPGA clear or almost clear at Week 16. In addition, nearly all subjects (85% to 90%) achieved PASI 75 at Week 16. As of 29 March 2018, 2,471 subjects in the psoriasis studies were exposed to ≥ 1 dose of risankizumab at any dosage level (including subjects who received placebo for Weeks 0 to 16 and then switched to risankizumab), representing 3,352 patient years (PYs) of exposure. Of the 2,471 subjects, 1,671 have had exposure to risankizumab at any dosage for at least 1 year. In the pivotal global Phase 3 plaque psoriasis studies, over the initial 16 weeks of exposure, the frequencies of adverse events (AEs) were similar in subjects treated with risankizumab (48.9%) compared to placebo (48.3%). Through Week 52, the exposure-adjusted rate of AEs in subjects in the risankizumab group was comparable to the event rate in the ustekinumab group (228.0 E/100 PYs in the risankizumab group and 281.0 E/100 PYs in the ustekinumab group). Likewise, serious adverse events per 100 subject-years were 9.4 for subjects treated with risankizumab and 10.9 for those treated with ustekinumab. Approximately 2.0% of subjects discontinued due to AEs. Few subjects had AEs in the following areas of safety interest: major adverse cardiac events (MACE), infections, malignancies, hepatic events, injection site events, or hypersensitivity reactions. The Phase 2 program in PsA with risankizumab demonstrated efficacy for improvement in signs and symptoms of PsA and the safety results were consistent with those known to be associated with IL-23 antagonists. Taken together, the safety and efficacy data from the Phase 2 program support further development of risankizumab in Phase 3 in subjects with PsA. Although rare, a potential for hepatic AEs is under constant surveillance by sponsors and regulators. Therefore, this study requires timely detection, evaluation, and follow-up of laboratory alterations in selected liver laboratory parameters to ensure subjects' safety. Increases in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including myocardial infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accident, and cardiovascular death, reported initially with anti-IL-12/23 agents, such as ustekinumab, have not been observed in longer term studies. While the likelihood of increased MACE is small, all suspected cardiovascular events (serious or nonserious) observed in this study will be adjudicated by an independent committee. An independent Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee (CAC) will adjudicate all observed cardio- and cerebro-vascular events and will remain blinded to treatment allocation (Section 6.4). Injection-site reactions to biologic therapies may be characterized by redness, swelling or induration at the injection site. Manifestations of anaphylaxis may include pruritus, hypotension, swollen lips and tongue, abdominal pain, and respiratory distress. Both local and systemic hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis are readily detectable, transient in nature, and manageable with standard medical treatment. Subjects will be closely monitored during study drug administration. The duration of the post-drug-administration safety surveillance is of 2 hours post first dose and 1 hour post all other doses. An independent Anaphylaxis Adjudication Committee (AAC) will adjudicate suspected anaphylactic reactions. The AAC will remain blinded to treatment allocation (Section 6.5). An external Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will review unblinded safety data on a periodic basis. Page 10 of 128"

Serum risankizumab concentrations will be summarized at the sampling time points using descriptive statistics. Anti-drug antibody titers will be tabulated for each ADA positive subject at the respective study visits. The number and percentage of subjects with ADA and nAb will be calculated. 3.7 Biomarker Sampling Optional whole blood and urine samples will be collected from subjects who provide consent to investigate prognostic, surrogate, predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi-study assessment of factors influencing the subjects' response to the study drug (or drugs of the same or similar class) or the development and progression of PsA or related conditions. The samples may also be used to develop new diagnostic tests, therapies, research methods or technologies. Assessments may include but may not be limited to nucleic acids, proteins, metabolomic analytes, or lipids. Research on samples collected in Germany will be restricted to PsA and risankizumab. 4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan This is a Phase 3, global, multicenter study that will evaluate subjects with moderately to severely active PsA. The subject population will consist of no more than 50% with a demonstrated inadequate response (lack of efficacy after a minimum 12 week duration of therapy) or intolerance to 1 or 2 biologic therapies (Bio IR). The remaining study population will be subjects who have had an inadequate response (lack of efficacy after a minimum 12 week duration of therapy) or intolerance to at least 1 csDMARD. The study consists of a Screening Period (approximately 35 days), Period 1, Period 2, and a 20-week Follow-up Period ( Figure 1 ). Period 1 is a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group period. Period 2 starts at Week 24. To maintain the blind to the original treatment allocation, treatment at the Week 24 Visit will be blinded: subjects randomized to placebo will receive blinded risankizumab 150 mg, and subjects randomized to risankizumab will receive blinded placebo. At Week 28 and for the remaining dosing visits (to Week 208), all subjects will receive open-label risankizumab 150 mg q12w. Subjects will remain blinded to the original randomization allocation for the duration of the study. The total study duration is 228 weeks including a telephone call 140 days (20 weeks) after last dose of study drug. Screening Period Subjects will be screened for eligibility to enroll in the study until approximately 420 subjects (210/arm) have been randomized. Once 420 subjects have been randomized, subjects who have started screening but not yet been randomized will be allowed to enroll in the study if eligible. No further subjects will be Page 14 of 128"

During the screening period, subjects will receive a full explanation of the study design and study procedures, provide a written informed consent, and undergo the screening procedures outlined in Appendix D . Subjects who do not meet all the laboratory eligibility criteria, but whose values are within 30% of the allowable laboratory value for any specific laboratory determination as defined in Section 5.1, at the principal investigator's discretion, may return for redraw of the specific laboratory test(s) that did not meet eligibility criteria. Other laboratory parameters associated with the Screening Visit should not be re-drawn. In addition, subjects not meeting eligibility criteria may undergo a second Screening Visit at the discretion of the Investigator. The subject must meet all the eligibility criteria in order to qualify for the study. There is no minimum period of time a subject must wait to re-screen for the study. For consideration beyond two Screening Visits, AbbVie must be consulted. Most screening procedures will be repeated during this second Screening Visit. Possible exceptions are noted below. If a subject has had an Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA; QuantiFERON Tuberculosis [TB] Gold test) and/or a purified protein derivative (PPD) test (or equivalent) (or both if required per local guidelines), and/or electrocardiogram (ECG) within the previous 90 days, these tests will not be required to be repeated for screening, provided the conditions noted in the Operations Manual are met. If allowed by local regulation, radiographs of hands and feet may be repeated. Period 1: Double-Blind Period Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive blinded risankizumab or placebo in 1:1 ratio through Week 24. Study visits occur in Period 1 at Week 0, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16, and dosing in Period 1 occurs at Week 0, Week 4, and Week 16 as outlined in Figure 1 . Period 2: Open-Label Period During Period 2, all subjects will receive risankizumab. To maintain the blind to the original treatment allocation, treatment at the Week 24 Visit will be blinded: subjects randomized to placebo will receive blinded risankizumab 150 mg, and subjects randomized to risankizumab will receive blinded placebo. At Week 28 and for the remaining dosing visits, all subjects will receive open-label risankizumab 150 mg q12w. Study dosing in Period 2 occur at Week 24, Week 28, and q12w thereafter until the final dosing time point at Week 208 as outlined in Figure 1 . Follow-up Period The Follow-up Period consists of a completion visit 12 weeks after the last study drug dose. An additional follow-up phone call will occur 8 weeks later, 20 weeks after last study drug dose, to determine the status of any ongoing AEs/serious adverse events (SAEs) or the occurrence of any new AEs/SAEs. The schematic of the study is shown in Figure 1 . Further details regarding study procedures are located in the Operations Manual. Page 15 of 128"

All efficacy measurements in this study are standard for assessing disease activity in subjects with PsA. Suitability of Subject Population The intended study population is subjects with moderately to severely active PsA. No more than 50% will have had a demonstrated inadequate response or intolerance to 1 or 2 biologic therapies (Bio-IR). The rest of the study population will be subjects who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to at least 1 csDMARD. Selection of Doses in the Study Risankizumab dose of 150 mg subcutaneous (SC) administered at Week 0, 4, and q12w thereafter is selected for this study. Subjects randomized to placebo will receive risankizumab dose of 150 mg SC at the same dosing frequency starting Week 24 (at Week 24, 28, and q12w thereafter) as those randomized to risankizumab at Week 0. The dose selection in this study was informed by analyses of safety and efficacy data from: !Completed Phase 1 through 3 PsO studies (Studies 1311.1, 1311.2, M16-008, M15-995, M16-010); !Ongoing Phase 3 PsO Study M15-992 !Phase 2 PsA Study M16-002 (1311.5) As well as: !Safety data from completed Phase 2 studies in subjects with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) (Study 1311.8) and CD (Study 1311.6) !Analyses of the exposure-response relationship of efficacy in PsA Phase 2 study In Phase 3 studies in subjects with PsO, a risankizumab dose of 150 mg SC administered at Weeks 0, 4, and q12w thereafter was evaluated. In the Phase 2 study in subjects with PsA, risankizumab 150 mg SC was administered as frequently as every 4 weeks over a period of 16 weeks. In Phase 2 studies in subjects with PsO, AS and CD, doses of risankizumab up to 180 mg SC were administered every 8 weeks or q12w for up to 24 weeks (Studies 1311.2, 1311.6, and 1311.8) and intravenous (IV) doses of up to 600 mg were administered every 4 weeks for 12 to 24 weeks (Study 1311.6 in subjects with CD). In the Phase 2 study of risankizumab in subjects with PsA (Study M16-002), 4 risankizumab dosing regimens were evaluated: single dose of 75 mg at Week 0 (N = 20); 150 mg at Week 0 and 12 (N = 39); 150 mg at Week 0, 4, and 16 (N = 42); and 150 mg at Week 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16 (N = 42). In this study, risankizumab-treated subjects demonstrated significant improvement compared to placebo in key rheumatology endpoints (ACR20/50/70 and DAS28-CRP) and skin-related endpoints (PASI 75/90/100). At Week 16, ACR20/50/70 responses were 62%/24%/7% in subjects who received risankizumab doses of 150 mg SC at Weeks 0, 4, and 16 compared to 36%/12%/0% in subjects on placebo. The Week 16 PASI 75/90/100 responses, in subjects with baseline BSA of skin symptoms ≥ 3%, were 70%/67%/50% in Page 17 of 128"

No further improvements in ACR or PASI responses were noted in subjects who received risankizumab doses of 150 mg at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, and 16. Risankizumab exposures in subjects with PsA in the Phase 2 study (Study M16-002) were comparable to those in subjects with PsO in Phase 1 through 3 studies at similar dose and dosing frequency. The ADA incidence (approximately 12% [17/140] over 32 weeks) in risankizumab-treated subjects with PsA (Study M16-002) was comparable to that in subjects with PsO or CD, and presence of ADA did not affect risankizumab plasma exposures. Exposure-response analyses were conducted to explore the relationship between risankizumab C avg(the average plasma concentration from Week 0 – 16) and ACR20/50/70 and PASI 75/90/100 responses at Week 16 in subjects with PsA (Study M16-002). For this analysis, C avgfrom Weeks 0 to 16 was used as an exposure metric, as it accounts for the differences in risankizumab dosing frequency across different arms in the study. A shallow trend for exposure-response relationship was observed for ACR20, PASI 75, and PASI 90 across the risankizumab regimens evaluated in the Phase 2 study. Only 20 subjects received the risankizumab 75 mg dose in Study M16-002 and among these, PASI assessments were performed only in those subjects with skin symptoms on BSA ≥ 3%, and only 9 subjects met that criterion. Since very limited data were available at the 75 mg dose, these subjects were excluded from the exposure-responses analyses. Excluding these subjects showed a clear exposure-response relationship for ACR20 and PASI 75/90/100 responses, with plateau of efficacy at C avg associated with the risankizumab dosing regimen of 150 mg at Weeks 0, 4, and 16. These results support that a risankizumab dosing regimen of 150 mg at Week 0, 4, and 16 is optimal for efficacy for subjects with PsA. Risankizumab was well tolerated in the Phase 2 study in subjects with PsA, with no discernible differences in treatment-emergent AEs and laboratory abnormalities between risankizumab-treated and placebo-treated subjects and no dose-related trends in risankizumab-treated subjects across all dosing regimens with doses up to 150 mg SC every 4 weeks. Additionally, safety data from ongoing Phase 3 study (Study M15-992) and completed Phase 2 and 3 studies (Studies 1311.2, M15-995, M16-008, and M16-010) in subjects with PsO, and final safety data from completed Phase 2 studies (Studies 1311.6 and 1311.8) in subjects with CD (Study 1311.6) and AS (Study 1311.8) indicate that risankizumab administration was safe and generally well tolerated by study participants, with no dose limiting toxicities. It is noteworthy that approximately 2120 PsO subjects have been enrolled in Phase 3 studies at a dose of 150 mg SC administered at Week 0, 4, and q12w thereafter, for up to 2 years in duration. Risankizumab doses of up to 600 mg IV were administered every 4 weeks for 12 to 24 weeks and up to 180 mg SC were administered every 8 weeks or every 12 weeks for up to 24 weeks in Phase 2 studies in subjects with CD, PsO, or AS. In addition, single doses of risankizumab up to 300 mg SC and 1200 mg intravenous (IV) have been administered to healthy subjects in a Phase 1 study (Study M16-513), and safety data indicate thatrisankizumab administration was safe and generally well tolerated by study participants with no dose- limiting toxicities. In addition, a single dose of risankizumab 1800 mg has been administered to healthy subjects in another Phase 1 study (Study M16-533), and preliminary safety data indicate that risankizumab administration was safe and generally well tolerated by study participants.

In summary, the risankizumab dose selected for evaluation in this Phase 3 study is expected to be efficacious based on data from Phase 2 PsA study (Study M16-002) with an acceptable safety profile based on data from completed and ongoing Phase 2 and 3 studies in subjects with PsO, CD, and AS. Treatment Duration Rationale Period 1 is a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group period. It is designed to compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of risankizumab versus placebo in subjects with moderately to severely active PsA. The treatment duration of Period 1 is designed to test the superiority of risankizumab versus placebo for achieving the primary efficacy endpoint (ACR20 at Week 24) and several secondary endpoints. Period 2 begins at Week 24. It is designed to assess long-term safety and maintenance of treatment response to risankizumab for subjects who have completed Period 1. 5 STUDY ACTIVITIES 5.1 Eligibility Criteria Subjects must meet all of the following criteria in order to be included in the study.

Subjects taking MTX should take a dietary supplement of oral folic acid (or equivalent) throughout study participation. At any time, the background csDMARD dose may be decreased for safety reasons. Additionally subjects must also continue on their stable doses of the following, starting 4 weeks prior to Baseline through the Week 36 assessments: !NSAIDs !Acetaminophen/paracetamol !Low-potency opiates (tramadol, codeine, or hydrocodone, alone or in combination with acetaminophen) !Oral corticosteroids (equivalent to prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day) If an enrolled subject is not taking any of the above at Baseline Visit, these concomitant medications must not be initiated except where permitted by protocol (specific time period or protocol-defined rescue). If taking any of the above at Baseline on an as-needed basis (PRN), a subject should continue to use them for the same reason and same dose each time but they should not be taken within the 24 hours prior to any study visit to avoid bias in outcome measurements. In the event of tolerability (or other safety) issues, these medications may be decreased, or discontinued with substitution of another permitted medication from that class. In Period 2, at Week 24 (after Week 24 assessments have been performed) and thereafter, subjects may use any topical therapy for PsO per investigator judgment.

AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any site. The Investigator may also stop the study at his/her site if he/she has safety concerns. If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will promptly notify the Investigator. COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Acceptable Protocol Modification During the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be necessary to ensure subject safety and continuity of care. Acceptable mitigation strategies are identified and included in the Operations Manual in Appendix F . The investigator should contact the sponsor before discontinuing a subject from the study for a reason other than ""planned per protocol,"" to ensure all acceptable mitigation steps have been explored. Refer to the Operations Manual in Appendix F for details on how to handle study activities/procedures. 5.6 Follow-Up for Subject Withdrawal from Study To minimize missing data for efficacy and safety assessments, subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug treatment should continue to be followed for all regularly scheduled visits, unless subjects have decided to discontinue the study participation entirely (withdrawal of informed consent). Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug should complete a Premature Discontinuation Visit (PD Visit) as soon as possible. Afterwards, subjects should follow the regular visit schedule as outlined in the Activity Schedule ( Appendix D ) and adhere to all study procedures except for dispensing study drug, pharmacokinetic (PK) sample collection, and biomarker sample collection for optional exploratory research. Once the subject has discontinued study drug, all rescue- and efficacy-driven discontinuation criteria no longer apply. If at any point a subject no longer wants to provide assessments (withdrawal of informed consent) following discontinuation of study drug, a second PD visit is not required. If a subject prematurely discontinues study participation but is willing to receive a 140-day (20-week) follow-up phone call after the last dose of study drug, the phone call should be completed to ensure all treatment-emergent AEs/serious AEs (SAEs) have been resolved. The follow-up phone call will not be conducted for subjects who withdraw study consent. All attempts must be made to determine the primary reason for discontinuation of study drug or study participation. The information will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. However, these Page 31 of 128"

Following discontinuation of study drug, the subject will be treated in accordance with the Investigator's best clinical judgment, irrespective of whether or not the subject decides to continue participation in the study. Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the study will not be replaced. 5.7 Study Drug Information about the study drug and placebo used in this study is presented in Table 1 . Table 1.

KG N/A = not applicable; SC = subcutaneous AbbVie will not supply drug other than risankizumab and matching placebo. If a subject is unable to come to the study site for a study visit due to the COVID-19 pandemic, study drug can be taken to the subject's residence and administered by trained site personnel under appropriate conditions. Open-label and blinded risankizumab and placebo will be packaged in quantities sufficient to accommodate study design. Each kit will be labeled per local requirements and this label must remain affixed to the kit. Upon receipt, study drug should be kept in the original packaging and stored as specified on the label in a secure, limited-access storage area. Each kit will contain a unique kit number. This kit number is assigned to a subject via interactive response technology (IRT) and encodes the appropriate study drug to be dispensed at the subject's corresponding study visit. All blank spaces on the label will be completed by the site staff prior to dispensing to subjects. Study drug will only be used for the conduct of this study. Interruption/Discontinuation of Study Drug Due to COVID-19 Delays in study drug dosing due to a subject with COVID-19 must be discussed with the AbbVie medical contact, along with the possibility of premature discontinuation from study drug. Follow Section 5.6for subjects who discontinue study drug. 5.8 Randomization/Drug Assignment All subjects will be assigned a unique identification number by the IRT at the Screening Visit. For subjects who rescreen, the screening number assigned by the IRT at the initial Screening Visit should be used. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups: Page 32 of 128"

The Investigator, study site personnel, and the subject will remain blinded to each subject's treatment in Period 1 throughout the study. AbbVie will carry out an analysis of the primary endpoint at Week 24. To maintain the blind during the blinded portion of the study, the risankizumab pre-filled syringe (PFS) and placebo PFS provided for the study will be identical in appearance. In the event of a medical emergency in which the Investigator believes that knowledge of study drug treatment is required, reasonable efforts must be made to contact the AbbVie Emergency Contact prior to breaking the blind, as long as it does not compromise subject safety. However, if an urgent therapeutic intervention is necessary which warrants breaking the blind prior to contacting AbbVie Emergency Contact, the Investigator can directly access the IRT system to break the blind without AbbVie agreement. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and eCRF, as applicable. 5.9 Protocol Deviations The Investigator is responsible for complying with all protocol requirements, written instructions, and applicable laws regarding protocol deviations. Protocol deviations are prohibited except when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. If a protocol deviation occurs (or is identified, including those that may be due to the COVID-19 pandemic), the Investigator is responsible for notifying the Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB), regulatory authorities (as applicable) and AbbVie. 6 SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS 6.1 Complaints and Adverse Events Complaints A complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the physical characteristics, identity, quality, purity, potency, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performance of a product/device. Complaints associated with any component of this investigational product must be reported to AbbVie. Product Complaint A product complaint is any complaint related to the biologic or drug component of the product or to the medical device component(s). Page 33 of 128"

Product complaints concerning the investigational product and/or device must be reported to AbbVie within 1 business day of the study site's knowledge of the event. Product complaints occurring during the study will be followed up to a satisfactory conclusion. Medical Complaints/Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product. The investigators will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of AEs on a routine basis throughout the study. All AEs will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion. If any of the following events are reported, then the following applicable supplemental report must be completed ( Table 2 ). Page 34 of 128"

Pregnancy While not an adverse event, pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the pregnancy. Subjects who become pregnant during the study must be discontinued from study drug. Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected. The pregnancy outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or congenital anomaly is considered an SAE and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event. 6.2 Toxicity Management Monitoring of toxicity related to stable background csDMARDs, titration of csDMARDs, or addition of csDMARDs should comply with country level requirements. 6.3 Independent Data Monitoring Committee An external Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will review unblinded safety data at approximate 6 month intervals throughout the course of the study. !A separate IDMC charter will be prepared outside of the protocol and will describe the roles and responsibilities of the IDMC members, frequency and triggers of data reviews, and relevant safety data to be assessed. Unblinded adjudicated cardio-cerebrovascular and anaphylaxis events will be presented to the IDMC for review on a periodic basis. !Communications from the IDMC to the Study Teams will not contain information that could potentially unblind the team to subject treatment assignments. 6.4 Cardiovascular Adjudication Committee An independent adjudication committee will adjudicate all observed cardio- and cerebro-vascular events and will remain blinded to treatment allocation. The events that are adjudicated and the adjudication process will be detailed in the CAC Adjudication Committee Charter (CAC). Dedicated eCRFs will be used as outlined in Table 2 . In addition, the site may be contacted for additional source documentation for relevant events. 6.5 Anaphylaxis Adjudication Committee While systemic hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis are not identified risks for risankizumab, the Sponsor has established an independent, blinded, expert committee to adjudicate events of anaphylaxis based on a pre-specified definition. An independent external AAC will adjudicate suspected anaphylactic reactions and will remain blinded to treatment allocation. The events that are adjudicated and the adjudication process will be detailed in the AAC Charter. A supplemental Hypersensitivity Page 36 of 128"

In addition, the site may be contacted for additional source documentation for relevant events. 7 STATISTICAL METHODS & DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 7.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans An unblinded analysis will be conducted after all subjects have completed Week 24 or have prematurely discontinued for the purpose of initial regulatory submission. Complete and specific details of the statistical analysis will be described and fully documented in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The statistical analyses will be performed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA). 7.2 Definition for Analysis Populations The Full Analysis Set (FAS) includes all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. The FAS will be used for all efficacy and Baseline analyses. Subjects will be grouped according to treatment as randomized. The Safety Analysis Set consists of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug. For the Safety Analysis Set, subjects are assigned to a treatment group based on the treatment actually received, regardless of the treatment randomized. 7.3 Statistical Analyses for Efficacy Imputation Methods Non-Responder Imputation incorporating multiple imputation to handle missing data due to COVID-19 (NRI-C): Subjects with a missed scheduled assessment visit due to reasons other than the COVID-19 pandemic will be handled by non-responder imputation. In addition, subjects will be considered as non- responders after the initiation of concomitant medications for PsA that could meaningfully impact efficacy assessment or initiation of rescue therapy. Missing data due to a COVID-19 infection or logistical restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic will be handled through multiple imputation. As Observed (AO): The AO analysis will not impute values for missing evaluations; therefore, a subject who does not have an evaluation on a scheduled visit will be excluded from the AO analysis for that visit. Regardless of premature discontinuation of study drug, initiation of concomitant medications for PsA that could meaningfully impact efficacy assessments, or initiation of rescue therapy, all observed data will be used in the AO analysis. Statistical Analyses for Efficacy The comparisons between the risankizumab and placebo treatment groups for the primary efficacy endpoint (ACR20 at Week 24) will be performed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test stratified by stratification factors. Page 37 of 128"
37,page_37,"STUDY M15-998 | Version 5.0 | EudraCT 2017-002464-40 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.For continuous efficacy endpoints, the treatment comparison will be conducted using a Mixed-Effect Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) method as primary inference purpose. The MMRM analysis will be conducted using mixed-effect model with observed measurements at all visits prior to initiation of any concomitant medications for PsA that could meaningfully impact efficacy assessments or rescue medications. The mixed model includes the categorical fixed effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, main stratification factors, and the continuous fixed covariate of baseline measurement. An unstructured variance covariance matrix will be used. The parameter estimations are based on the assumption of data being missing at random and using the method of restricted maximum likelihood (REML). Categorical efficacy variables will be analyzed using the CMH test controlling for stratification variables. NRI-C imputation will be used for missing data imputation. The primary and ranked secondary efficacy endpoints will be tested with multiplicity adjustment to ensure a strong control of family-wise type I error rate at significance level alpha = 0.05 (2-sided). The details of the testing procedure will be specified in SAP. Long-term efficacy by time point will be summarized using descriptive statistics. For binary endpoints, frequencies and percentages will be summarized. For continuous endpoints, the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum will be reported. Additional subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis will be specified in the SAP. Sample Size Estimation Approximately 420 subjects will be randomized to risankizumab 150 mg or placebo in a ratio of 1:1 (210 subject/treatment group). A sample size of 210 in each group will have 90% power to detect a difference in HAQ-DI mean change from baseline of 0.24 (the difference between risankizumab 150 mg mean change from baseline of –0.37 and placebo mean change from baseline of –0.13) assuming that the common standard deviation is 0.72 using a two-group Satterthwaite t-test with a two-sided significance level of 0.05. This sample size also ensures that analyses will have at least a 90% power to detect a 20% treatment difference in ACR20 at Week 24, with assumed placebo response rate of 35%, using a two-sided test at a 0.05 significance level and accounting for a 10% dropout rate. 7.4 Statistical Analyses for Safety Safety analyses will be carried out using the Safety Analysis Set. There will be two sets of planned safety analysis: safety analysis by Week 24, and long-term safety analysis. Safety will be assessed by AEs, physical examinations, laboratory assessments, and vital signs. Frequency tables and lists of subjects with treatment emergent AEs by preferred term as in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), by system organ class and preferred term, by severity, and by relationship to the study drug as assessed by the Investigator will be provided. The changes from Baseline in vital signs, physical examination results, and clinical laboratory values will be analyzed in a descriptive manner. Shift of laboratory values from Baseline to defined time points will be tabulated. Page 38 of 128"

In addition, ADA titers will be tabulated for each ADA positive subject at the respective study visits. The number and percentage of subjects with ADA and nAb will be calculated. Additional analyses may be conducted if appropriate. 7.6 Analysis of Exploratory Variables Data from exploratory research samples will be tabulated for each subject with a breakdown by dose group. Exploratory analyses will be performed on the data from exploratory research samples. These exploratory analyses are separate from the study statistical analysis plan and may not be reported in study report. 8 ETHICS 8.1 Independent Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Board (IEC/IRB) The protocol, informed consent form(s), recruitment materials, and all participant materials will be submitted to the IEC/IRB for review and approval. Approval of both the protocol and the informed consent form(s) must be obtained before any participant is enrolled. Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by the IEC/IRB before the changes are implemented to the study. In addition, all changes to the consent form(s) will be IEC/IRB approved. 8.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, Operations Manual, International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. Responsibilities of the Investigator are specified in Appendix B . In the event of a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic leading to difficulties in performing protocol-specified procedures, AbbVie will engage with study site personnel in efforts to ensure the safety of subjects, maintain protocol compliance, and minimize risks to the integrity of the study while trying to best manage subject continuity of care. This may include alternative methods for assessments (e.g., phone contacts or virtual study visits), alternative locations for data collection (e.g., use of a local laboratory instead of a central laboratory), study visit schedule modification, and home study drugadministration by trained site personnel to ensure continuity of treatment, where allowed. Refer to the Operations Manual in Appendix F for additional details. In all cases, these alternative measures must be allowed by local regulations and permitted by IRB/IEC. Investigators should notify AbbVie if any urgent safety measures are taken to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. Page 39 of 128"

Investigators must also notify AbbVie if any urgent safety measures are taken. !Section 9– noted that remote monitoring may be employed as needed. !Appendix D – added reference to Operations Manual for allowed modification. !Appendix F – Operations Manual updated to include details on how to perform specific activities/procedures that may be impacted by changes in global/local regulations due to the pandemic. Rationale for all of the above changes: To make modifications to the protocol related to the COVID-19 pandemic that ensures subject safety, continuity of care for subjects, and data integrity within the study. The following changes not related to the COVID-19 pandemic were also made: !Section 3.3– Added the ranked secondary endpoint ACR20 at Week 16. Page 56 of 128"
56,page_56,"STUDY M15-998 | Version 5.0 | EudraCT 2017-002464-40 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Rationale: As a clinically meaningful measure of efficacy, ACR20 with multiplicity control at an earlier timepoint will provide additional data on treatment effect. !Section 3.3– Modified resolution of enthesitis and dactylitis to be unranked additional secondary endpoints without multiplicity adjustment. Rationale: Given the expected size of the subpopulations for these endpoints, the resulting date are not expected to provide adequate power to be clinically meaningful. No data from this study or any other ongoing study was used to make this determination. !Section 3.4– Corrected the description of the endpoint ""Change from Baseline in Modified Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC)"" to ""Proportion of subjects who achieve a Modified Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) response."" Rationale: Change from baseline is not the correct method to evaluate a binary endpoint. !Section 7.3– Modified wording on the NRI-C and AO imputation methods. Rationale: To clarify differences between the NRI-C and AO methods. !Section 7.3– Modified wording on MMRM analysis for continuous variables. Rationale: To clarify which data will be used in the MMRM analysis. Page 57 of 128"

If this situation arises, in addition to the study informed consent, additional verbal consent may be obtained prior to these adaptations or substantial changes in study conduct in accordance with local regulations. 3.2 Medical History A complete medical history including the subtype of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), cardiovascular history and cardiovascular risk factors, history of hepatitis B vaccination, tobacco (including e-cigarettes) and alcohol will be taken at Screening. A detailed history of prior biologic(s) and csDMARD(s) and reasons for discontinuing will also be collected. The subject's medical history will be updated at the Study Day 1 visit. This updated medical history will serve as the Baseline for clinical assessment. The subject's demographic data, including year of birth, gender, race, and ethnicity will be collected, when allowed per local regulatory guidelines. 3.3 Adverse Event Assessment Please refer to Section 4.2. 3.4 Patient-Reported Outcomes Subjects will complete the self-administered patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments. Subjects should be instructed to follow the instructions provided with the instrument and to provide the best possible response to each item. Site personnel shall not provide interpretation or assistance to subjects other than encouragement to complete the tasks. Site personnel will encourage completion of the instrument at all specified visits and will ensure that a response is entered for all items. All PROs are collected electronically. The subject should complete the questionnaires before site personnel perform any clinical assessments and preferably before any interaction with site personnel has occurred to avoid biasing the subject's response. Data stored on the central server will be considered source. The investigator and delegated staff will be able to access uploaded subject-entered data via a password protected website until the generation, receipt, and confirmation of the study archive. Data from the ePRO system will be archived and provided to the investigator at that time as a durable record of the site's ePRO data. Subjects will complete the following questionnaires as specified in the Study Activities Table (Appendix D of protocol). A validated translation will be provided in their local language, as applicable: Page 76 of 128"
76,page_76,"p. 19 of 68 OPERATIONS MANUAL FOR CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL M15-998 Version 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.BASDAI The BASDAI is composed of 6 items investigating 5 domains (fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain/swelling, areas of localized tenderness, morning stiffness), with 1 item for each of the first 4 domains and 2 items for the last domain (morning stiffness). A lower score indicates less disease activity. EQ-5D-5L Health Questionnaire The EQ-5D-5L is a health state utility instrument that evaluates preference for health status (utility). The 5 items in the EQ-5D-5L comprise 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) each of which are rated on 5 levels of severity. Responses to the 5 items encode a discrete health state which is mapped to a preference (utility) specific for different societies. Subjects also rate their perception of their overall health on a separate visual analogue scale. FACIT-Fatigue Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue is a 13-item questionnaire that evaluates fatigue/tiredness and its impact on daily activities and functioning in chronic diseases. This instrument includes items such as tiredness, weakness, listlessness, lack of energy, and the impact of these feelings on daily functioning (e.g., sleeping, and social activities). A lower score indicates less negative impact on daily activities. HAQ-DI Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) is a self-reported assessment of how the patient's illness affects their ability to function in their daily life over the past week. The HAQ-DI for a patient is calculated as the mean of the following 8 category scores: Dressing and Grooming, Rising, Eating, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Grip, and Activities. A lower score demonstrates less disability. Patient's Assessment of Pain (VAS) The Patient's Assessment of Pain (VAS) allows patients score on a 100 mm horizontal scale (0 being no pain and 100 being severe pain) to assess the patient's overall assessment of pain due to the disease condition during the past 24 hours. PtGA of Disease Activity (VAS) Patient's Global Assessment (PtGA) of Disease Activity (VAS) allows patients to score on a 100 mm horizontal scale (0 being very well and 100 being very poorly) to assess the patient's overall functionality assessment considering the disease activity within the past 24 hours. SF-36 Health Questionnaire The SF-36 Health Questionnaire is a 36-item survey of patient health consisted of 8 scaled scores, which are weighted sums of the questions in their section. The 8 sections are physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, Page 77 of 128"

It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. A higher score indicates a more favorable health state. WPAI The WPAI Questionnaire is a well-validated instrument to measure impairments in work and activities. The questionnaire includes 6 questions to assess the effect of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) on the patient's ability to work and perform regular activities in the past 7 days. Patient reported outcome assessments are provided in Appendix Q . COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications If electronic PRO instruments (ePROs) cannot be completed on the tablet, they are permitted to be completed via phone or video interview. Site staff will record the subject's responses on the screen shot of the PRO in the subject's language. The date, time and interviewer name should be recorded in the source document. The investigator or study coordinator must transcribe the PRO responses into the TrialManager website. No other site roles will receive access to enter data into TrialManager. Training will be required for investigator data entry into TrialManager and will be provided upon request of the sponsor. If appropriate site personnel can travel to the subject's home, the tablet can be taken to the subject's home for ePRO completion. All ePROs should be completed for the assigned visit. 3.5 Investigator Assessments The investigator assessments will be conducted at the study visits specified in the Study Activities Table. The results of the assessments, with the exception of the Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of Disease Activity (VAS), will be recorded on paper forms and entered into the electronic case report form (eCRF). The PGA will be entered into the ePRO device. If possible, the investigator assessments should be performed by an independent and blinded assessor who should not perform any other study related procedures. In order to minimize variability, the same assessor should evaluate the subject at each visit for the duration of the trial. A back-up assessor should be identified. The assessor should be an independent qualified medical professional (i.e., nurse, physician's assistant, physician, or other qualified person). It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that all assessors are qualified and trained to perform assessments and that all training is documented. If the assessor is not available, the pre-identified back- up assessor should perform such assessments. Page 78 of 128"
78,page_78,"p. 21 of 68 OPERATIONS MANUAL FOR CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL M15-998 Version 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Assessors must complete the following training modules provided by the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA): !Assessment of Enthesitis and Dactylitis in Psoriatic Arthritis !PASI/BSA--Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) !Assessment of Synovitis in Psoriatic Arthritis – Joint Count The training modules will be provided via web portals. The training for PASI/BSA is to be completed at 3 time points and may be completed in either Study M16-011 or Study M15-998. The time points are as follows for each assessor at the site: 1. Prior to the first subject screened 2. Between randomization and the first Week 4 visit3. Between Week 12 and the first Week 24 visit. If an assessor has been certified for any of the above GRAPPA trainings in the previous 6 months, the respective GRAPPA training module(s) required prior to screening the first subject may be waived upon providing the training certificate. The PASI/BSA training required at the second and third time points described above may not be waived. HRU Questionnaire Sites will complete a HRU questionnaire at the study visits specified in the Study Activities Table. The questionnaire will be an interview administered by the site. The answers will be completed on the source worksheet provided by the sponsor and entered in the eCRF. The assessor is not required to be independent and should be a qualified medical professional or a study coordinator. Psoriasis Assessments PASI The PASI is a measure of psoriasis severity. Four anatomic sites – head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities – are assessed for erythema, induration, and desquamation using a 5-point scale. Based on the extent of lesions in a given anatomic site, the area affected is assigned a numerical value. Since the head, upper extremities, trunk and lower extremities correspond to approximately 10, 20, 30, and 40% of body surface area, respectively; the PASI score will be calculated in the eCRF. E, I, D, and A denote erythema, induration, desquamation, and area, respectively, and h, u, t, and l denote head, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities, respectively. PASI scores range from 0.0 to 72.0 with the highest score representing complete erythroderma of the severest possible degree. Page 79 of 128"

The assessor should be an independent qualified medical professional. BSA–PsO The subject's right or left hand should be selected as the measuring device. For purposes of clinical estimation, the total surface of the palm plus five digits will be assumed to be approximately equivalent to 1%. Measurement of the total area of involvement by the assessor is aided by imagining if scattered plaques were moved so that they were next to each other and then estimating the total area involved. The assessor should be an independent qualified medical professional. TJC and SJC Assessment TJC Assessment An assessment of 68 joints will be done for tenderness by pressure manipulation on physical examination. Joint pain/tenderness will be classified as: present, absent, replaced, or no assessment. Joints injected with corticosteroid will be considered non-evaluable for 90 days from the time of the injection. The assessor should be an independent qualified medical professional. SJC Assessment An assessment of 66 joints will be done by directed physical examination. The hip joints are not assessed for swelling; all other joints that are assessed for tenderness will also be assessed for swelling. Joint swelling will be classified as present, absent, replaced, or no assessment. Joints injected with corticosteroid will be considered non-evaluable for 90 days from the time of the injection. The assessor should be an independent qualified medical professional. Dactylitis LDI This evaluation will be conducted to assess the presence or absence of dactylitis in all 20 of the subject's digits. The assessment should begin with visual inspection of the hands and feet. For each pair of digits in which one or both digits appear dactylitic, the circumference of the affected digits (both right and left side) will be assessed using a dactylometer. Additionally, the affected digit pairs will be assessed for tenderness by squeezing the digital shaft mid-way between the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints and will be recorded as tenderness, yes or no. Tenderness should not be assessed by squeezing the joint lines. Digits injected with corticosteroid will be considered non-evaluable for 90 days from the time of the injection. If a digit is missing and its contralateral digit is dactylitic, ""digit Page 80 of 128"
80,page_80,"p. 23 of 68 OPERATIONS MANUAL FOR CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL M15-998 Version 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.absent"" will be recorded for the missing digit. For any digit without an available dactylometer measurement, the standard reference value will be utilized in calculation of the LDI. The standard reference values will not be entered into the eCRF. A dactylometer will be provided to sites for use. The assessor should be an independent qualified medical professional. Enthesitis LEI LEI is a validated enthesitis index that uses 6 sites for evaluation of enthesitis: lateral epicondyle humerus left and right, Achilles tendon insertion left and right, and medial condyle femur left and right. Tenderness on examination is recorded as either present, absent, or not assessed for each of the 6 sites, for an overall score range of 0 – 6. Enthesitis sites injected with corticosteroid will be considered non-evaluable for 90 days from the time of the injection. The assessor should be an independent qualified medical professional. SPARCC Enthesitis Index This evaluation will be conducted to assess the presence or absence of enthesitis at 8 bilateral sites: medial epicondyle, lateral epicondyle, supraspinatus insertion to the greater tuberosity of the humerus, greater trochanter, quadriceps insertion into the superior border of the patella, patellar ligament insertion into the inferior pole of the patella or tibial tubercle, Achilles tendon insertion into calcaneum, and plantar fascia insertion into calcaneum. Tenderness on examination is recorded as either present, absent, or not assessed for each of the 16 sites. For scoring purposes, the inferior patella and tibial tuberosity are considered to be one site due to their anatomical proximity. The overall score range is 0 – 16. Enthesitis sites injected with corticosteroid will be considered non-evaluable for 90 days from the time of the injection. The lateral epicondyle and Achilles tendon insertion will only need to be assessed once since the 2 bilateral sites overlap between the LEI and SPARCC. The assessor should be an independent qualified medical professional. Psoriatic Spondylitis This evaluation will be conducted at Baseline only as part of assessing PsA subtype. If the investigator determines that a subject has psoriatic spondylitis, how the diagnosis was made should be recorded (i.e., clinical evaluation, radiography and/or MRI). Where possible, this evaluation should be assessed by a rheumatologist. Page 81 of 128"

Subjects may receive bilateral radiographs of the hands and feet if needed to determine whether the subject fulfills item 5 of the CASPAR criteria ( Appendix B ). Radiographs will be locally read for CASPAR scoring. PGA Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of Disease Activity (VAS) allows physicians to score on a 100 mm horizontal scale (0 being very well and 100 being very poorly) to assess the patient's overall functionality assessment considering the disease activity within the past 24 hours. The assessor is not required to be independent but should be a qualified medical professional, preferably a physician. Investigator assessments are shown in Appendix D through Appendix P . 3.6 Biomarker Sampling Optional whole blood and urine samples will be collected for exploratory research throughout the study as outlined in Section 2.1. All biomarker samples should be labeled and shipped as outlined in the study-specific laboratory manual. AbbVie (or people or companies working with AbbVie) will store the samples and data in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality. The samples may be retained while research on risankizumab (or drugs of this class) or psoriatic arthritis and related conditions continues, but for no longer than 20 years after study completion, or per local requirement. 3.7 12-Lead Electrocardiogram A 12-lead ECG will be performed at Screening using local equipment, as specified in Section 2.1. If a subject has had an ECG within the previous 90 days, it will not be required to be repeated for screening provided the conditions noted in this section are met. The ECG should be performed prior to blood collection. The ECGs will be evaluated by an appropriately trained physician at the site (""local reader""). The local reader from the site will sign and date all ECG tracings and will provide his/her global interpretation as a written comment on the tracing using the following categories: !Normal ECG Page 82 of 128"
82,page_82,"p. 25 of 68 OPERATIONS MANUAL FOR CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL M15-998 Version 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.!Abnormal ECG – not clinically significant !Abnormal ECG – clinically significant In case of an abnormal ECG, the abnormal finding will be documented. Clinically significant ECG findings noted at screening will be captured in Medical History. Only the local reader's evaluation of the ECG will be collected and documented in the subject's source folder. The automatic machine reading (i.e., machine-generated measurements and interpretation that are automatically printed on the ECG tracing) will not be collected but will be retained in subject's source records. 3.8 Height and Weight Height and weight will be measured without shoes. The subject will wear lightweight clothing and no shoes during weighing. Weight should be measured at screening, Week 24 and Week 52. After Week 52, weight should be measured every 24 weeks (at Week 76, Week 100, Week 124, Week 148, Week 172, Week 196, and the Week 220/PD visit). 3.9 Vital Signs Vital sign determinations of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) and pulse rate will be obtained at visits as specified in Section 2.1before blood draws are performed. Blood pressure and pulse rate should be measured after the subject has been sitting for at least 3 minutes. Any significant abnormal vital signs findings will be reported as AEs. 3.10 Physical Examination A complete physical examination will be performed at the designated study visits as specified in Section 2.1. The physical examination performed on Study Day 1 will serve as the Baseline physical examination for the entire study. Any significant physical examination findings after the first dose will be recorded as AEs. All findings, whether related to an AE or part of each subject's medical history, will be captured on the appropriate eCRF page. At any visits that do not require a full physical examination, a symptom-directed physical examination can be performed as deemed necessary by the Investigator. Page 83 of 128"

All subcutaneous (SC) doses of risankizumab and placebo will be administered by study site personnel under the direction of the Investigator. The date and time (to the nearest minute) of onset of study drug administration will be recorded in the subject's medical record. The first dose of study drug will be administered after all other Baseline (Study Day 1) procedures are completed. COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications If a subject cannot travel to the site for a visit when study drug administration is planned, site personnel may travel to the subject's home to conduct an at-home visit. Study drug may be transported under appropriate storage conditions and administered by trained site personnel. The site must contact the Sponsor to obtain instructions on how to dispense drug in the IRT system for at-home visits or for visits when a joint count assessment cannot be made. If an at-home visit is scheduled, site staff should also bring the ePRO tablet to the home for the subject to complete those assessments, see Section 3.4for more details. Monitoring for Hypersensitivity Reactions Therapeutic protein products, such as biologics, may elicit a range of acute effects, from symptomatic discomfort to sudden, fatal reactions that have often been grouped as 'infusion reactions' in the past. Although the term implies a certain temporal relationship, infusion reactions are otherwise not well defined and may encompass a wide range of clinical events, including anaphylaxis and other events that may not be directly related to antibody responses, such as cytokine release syndrome. All appropriate medical support measures (e.g., diphenhydramine, steroids, epinephrine, oxygen) for the treatment of suspected hypersensitivity reactions should be available for immediate use in the event that a suspected hypersensitivity reaction occurs. Subjects who manifest any new signs or symptoms during the injection should be monitored for appropriate resolution prior to leaving the site. Subjects are encouraged to report any symptoms related to a possible injection-related reactions or local injection site reaction or late phase reactions to the site any time during the study. A patient information card listing the symptoms of these reactions will be provided to the participants. In the event of a suspected anaphylactic reaction, in addition to the standard AE eCRF, the supplemental Hypersensitivity Reaction Signs and Symptoms eCRF should also be completed by the site. The clinical criterion for diagnosing anaphylaxis is provided in Appendix C for reference; symptoms of anaphylactic reaction usually occur within 24 hours after exposure to an allergen. These are guidelines that are used to help diagnose anaphylaxis. The investigator is encouraged to report any suspected reactions. Page 84 of 128"
84,page_84,"p. 27 of 68 OPERATIONS MANUAL FOR CLINICAL STUDY PROTOCOL M15-998 Version 5.0 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION No use or disclosure outside AbbVie is permitted without prior written authorization from AbbVie.Subjects will be monitored throughout the study for signs and symptoms suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions, including allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. A medical person qualified in the treatment of acute hypersensitivity reactions must be present during the injections. Subjects will be closely monitored for approximately 2 hours after the first dose administration (Study Day 1) and Week 24 (first dose of risankizumab for subjects randomized to placebo) and 1 hour after all other dose administrations. Anaphylaxis TestingIn the event of a suspected anaphylactic reaction, a blood sample for risankizumab drug level, ADA, and nAb should be collected once within 24 hours of the reaction. In addition to risankizumab drug level, ADA and nAb assays, blood tests to be conducted in the event of a suspected anaphylactic reaction are: !Serum tryptase: 15 minutes to 3 hours of symptom onset, and no later than 6 hours (as tryptase may remain elevated for 6 or more hours after the onset and therefore may still be informative if obtained after 3 hours); it is also requested to collect a follow-up tryptase level a minimum of 2 weeks after the recorded event or at the next study visit. !Plasma histamine: 5 to 15 minutes of symptom onset, and no later than 1 hour. 3.12 Clinical Laboratory Tests A certified laboratory will be utilized to process and provide results for the clinical laboratory tests. Laboratory reference ranges will be obtained prior to the initiation of the study. The Baseline (Day 1) laboratory test results for clinical assessment for a particular test will be defined as the last measurement prior to the initial dose of study drug. Instructions regarding the collection, processing, and shipping of these samples will be provided by the central laboratory. If a laboratory test value is outside the reference range and the investigator considers the laboratory result to be clinically significant, the investigator will: !repeat the test to verify the out-of-range value; !follow the out-of-range value to a satisfactory clinical resolution; or !discontinue the subject from the study or require the subject to receive treatment; in this case, the laboratory result will be recorded as an adverse event.

The serum pregnancy test will be sent to and performed by the central laboratory. If the serum pregnancy test is positive the subject is considered a screen failure. If the serum pregnancy test is borderline, it should be repeated to determine eligibility. If the repeat serum pregnancy test is: !Positive, the subject is considered a screen failure; !Negative, the subject can be enrolled into the trial; !Still borderline ≥ 3 days later: If no clinical suspicion of pregnancy and there are other pathological causes of borderline results, the borderline results will be considered documentation of continued lack of a positive result and the subject can be enrolled into the study. Determination of postmenopausal status will be made during the Screening period based on the subject's history and confirmed by FSH if appropriate. A pregnant or breastfeeding female will not be eligible for participation or continuation in this study. Urine Pregnancy Test Additional urine pregnancy tests for female subjects of childbearing potential will be performed at visits indicated in Section 2.1. More frequent pregnancy tests will be performed throughout the study if required per local/country requirements. If the urine pregnancy test (which is performed at the site) is negative, begin or continue dosing. If urine pregnancy test is positive, withhold dosing and perform a serum pregnancy test. Pregnant subjects must discontinue from the study. Chemistry Blood samples at Baseline will be collected following a minimum 8-hour fast. If a subject is not able to fast due to unforeseen circumstances, the nonfasting status will be recorded in study source documentation and lab requisition. Subjects are not required to fast before laboratory assessments at other time points. Urinalysis Dipstick urinalysis will be completed by the central laboratory at the Screening Visit. Specified abnormal macroscopic urinalyses dipstick results will be followed up with a microscopic analysis at the central laboratory. Page 87 of 128"

Subjects with hepatitis B (HBs Ag positive [+] or detected sensitivity on the HBV DNA PCR qualitative test) or hepatitis C (HCV RNA detectable in any subject with anti-HCV Ab) will be excluded. Subjects who have been vaccinated against hepatitis B and are HBs Ab positive may be enrolled. If Hepatitis B Surface Antigen is negative but Hepatitis B Core Antibodies total is positive, Hepatitis B Virus DNA will be quantified. If Hepatitis B Virus DNA level is undetectable at Screening, the subject can participate in this trial. If Hepatitis C Virus Antibodies is positive, Hepatitis C Virus RNA will be quantified. If Hepatitis C RNA level is undetectable at Screening, the subject can participate in this trial. Figure 1. Interpretation and Management of HBV Serologic Test Results * A positive test result for HBs Ab is expected for subjects who have had a HBV vaccination. For subjects without a history of HBV vaccination (and where mandated by local requirements), a positive result for HBs Ab requires HBV DNA PCR testing. ** Where mandated by local requirements; subjects with HBs Ab+ and/or HBc Ab+ and negative HBV DNA at screening should have HBV DNA PCR testing performed q12w. HBV DNA PCR testing q12w is not necessary when the subject has a history of HBV vaccine and is HBs Ab+ and HBc Ab-. HIV Testing HIV testing will be performed at Screening. The Investigator must discuss any local reporting requirements to local health agencies with the subject. The site will report confirmed positive results to their health agency per local regulations, if necessary. If a subject has a confirmed positive result, the Investigator must discuss with the subject the potential implications to the subject's health and subject should receive or be referred for clinical care promptly. A subject will not be eligible for study participation if test results indicate a positive HIV infection. AbbVie will not receive results from the testing and will not be made aware of any positive result. Ineligibility due to a positive HIV test should be documented in the CRF as a screen failure due to criterion 16 to keep this test result private. Page 88 of 128"

Subjects who have had a TB test performed within 90 days of the Screening Visit will not need to have the test repeated, provided all of the protocol-required documentation is available at the site, and no new TB risk factors have been identified. At Screening, all subjects will be assessed for evidence of TB, and if positive, additional risk factors will be assessed. At Week 52, subjects with no prior positive TB test will be tested for TB by either the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test (or IGRA equivalent) or a TB Skin Test (PPD). The QuantiFERON®-TB Gold assay test will be supplied and analyzed by the central laboratory. (QuantiFERON-TB test is preferred over TB Skin Test.) Details on the collection, shipment of samples, and reporting of results by the central laboratory are provided to investigators in the laboratory manual. !If the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test (or IGRA equivalent) is NOT possible , or if both the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Test (or IGRA equivalent) and the PPD Skin Test are required per local guidelines, the PPD Skin Test will be performed according to standard clinical practice. !The PPD Skin Test should be read by a licensed healthcare professional between 48 and 72 hours after administration. A subject who does not return within 72 hours will need to be rescheduled for another skin test. !The reaction will be measured in millimeters (mm) of induration and induration ≥ 5 mm is considered a positive reaction. The absence of induration will be recorded as ""0 mm,"" not ""negative."" !If subject had a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold (or IGRA equivalent) or PPD test at Screening, the test should not be repeated. Subjects who have had an ulcerating reaction to the TB Skin Test in the past should not be re-exposed and should not be tested by a PPD skin test. !If the TB screening test (either PPD or the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test [or IGRA equivalent]) is positive, or if there is a repeat indeterminate QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (or IGRA equivalent) upon retesting, subjects may participate in the study if further work-up (according to local practice/guidelines) establishes conclusively that the patient has no evidence of active TB. !If the subject is diagnosed with active TB , the subject should not be randomized in the study and should not receive study drug. Subject will be considered as a screening failure . !If presence of latent TB is established, subjects who are considered at low risk for reactivation defined by local guidelines and investigator judgment are not required to be treated with prophylactic anti-TB therapy prior to or during the study. !If the subject is diagnosed with active TB after being randomized, the subject should not receive any further study drug, and a Premature Discontinuation (PD) Visit procedures should be followed (Section 2.1).

In the case of a TB-related AE, a TB supplemental form that provides additional information will be completed by the investigator or designee. FSH FSH should be tested at Screening if the female subject is ≤55 years of age AND has had no menses for ≥12 months AND has no history of permanent surgical sterilization. Anaphylaxis Testing In the event of a suspected anaphylactic reaction or other systemic post-dose reaction, blood samples should be collected as stated in Section 3.11 . COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications If travel restrictions or other changes in local regulations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic prevent the subject from having blood drawn for laboratory testing at the study site, if possible, arrange for subjects to have laboratory work done at a local laboratory, hospital, or other facility. Local laboratory results should be obtained along with reference ranges. Local laboratory results and reference ranges need to be entered into the EDC system and also kept with the subjects' source documentation. Local laboratory results should be reviewed by the Investigator as soon as possible. If laboratory samples cannot be obtained, study drug administration may be continued provided the investigator has reviewed all prior laboratory results. In addition, the Investigator must review and confirm the subject has no additional issues that would impact the ability of the subject to safely continue use of the study drug in the absence of current labs. The subject should be scheduled for laboratory draws as soon as feasible. 3.13 Drug Concentration and Anti-Drug Antibody Measurements Pharmacokinetic, ADA, and nAb samples should be collected within 60 minutes prior to the dose at dosing visits. Collection of Blood Samples for Risankizumab Analysis, ADA Assay, and nAb Assay Blood samples for analysis of risankizumab serum concentrations, ADA assay, and nAb assay will be collected during the treatment period on the study days and time points specified in the protocol. Samples will be collected by venipuncture into appropriately labeled, evacuated serum collection tubes. The time that each blood sample (PK and ADA/nAb) is collected will be recorded to the nearest minute. Page 90 of 128"

The presence of ADA to risankizumab will be assessed via a tiered approach with an electrochemiluminescence assay using screening, confirmatory, and titration analyses. Samples that are confirmed positive may be further characterized in a validated nAb assay. Any additional analytes may be analyzed using nonvalidated methods. Serum samples collected for risankizumab PK and ADA analysis may be used for future assay development or validation activities. Risankizumab nAb samples upon request may be used for the analysis of neutralizing ADAs. Disposition of Samples The frozen serum samples for risankizumab analysis, ADA and nAb assays will be packed in dry ice sufficient to last during transportation and shipped from the study site to the central lab according to instructions from AbbVie. 3.14 Out of Window Visits Due to COVID-19 Pandemic If a visit can be performed onsite but OOW, consult with the sponsor to determine if the OOW visit is permitted. Regardless of whether an onsite OOW visit can occur, a phone call from the site to the enrolled subject should be conducted as close to the date of the study visit as possible to query for any AEs and to review concomitant medications. 4 SAFETY MANUAL 4.1 Methods and Timing of Safety Assessment All serious adverse events (SAEs) as well as protocol-related nonserious AEs (e.g., bruising related to blood draw) will be collected from the time the subject signed the study-specific informed consent until study drug administration. From the time of study drug administration until 140 days (20 weeks) following discontinuation of study treatment has elapsed, all AEs and SAEs will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.

Any worsening of a pre-existing condition or illness is considered an AE. Worsening in severity of a reported AE should be reported as a new AE. Laboratory abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be AEs only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention, meets protocol specific criteria (see Section 6.2 in the Protocol regarding toxicity management), and/or if the investigator considers them to be AEs. An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an AE if the surgery/procedure is being performed for a pre-existing condition and the surgery/procedure has been pre-planned prior to study entry. However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly during the study (e.g., surgery performed earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an AE. 4.3 Serious Adverse Events Classification of Serious Adverse Events is defined as follows: Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject. Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not been taken. This does not include an event that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form. Page 92 of 128"

This does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility. Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that results in fetal loss. Persistent or Significant Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject. Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g., sprained ankle). Important Medical Event Requiring Medical or Surgical Intervention to Prevent Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately life- threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity). Additionally, any elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event. Examples of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 4.4 Adverse Event Definition of Severity Grade When criteria are available, events should be graded to the 5 criteria as described in the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0,1which can be accessed at: https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocoldevelopment/electronic_applications/docs/CTCAE_v5_Quick _Reference_8.5x11.pdf. Ifno grading criteria are provided for the reported event, the event should be graded as mild, moderate, or severe per the Investigator's judgment. Mild Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Moderate Minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL). Severe Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL.Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Death related to AE. Page 93 of 128"

All follow-up information is to be reported to the Sponsor (or an authorized representative) and documented in source as required by the Sponsor. Product Complaints associated with adverse events will be reported in the study summary. All other complaints will be monitored on an ongoing basis. Product Complaints may require return of the product with the alleged complaint condition. In instances where a return is requested, every effort should be made by the investigator to return the product within 30 days. If returns cannot be accommodated within 30 days, the site will need to provide justification and an estimated date of return. 5 COUNTRY-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS 5.1 SUSAR Reporting AbbVie will be responsible for Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) reporting for the Investigational Medical Product (IMP) in accordance with global and local guidelines, and Appendix A of the Investigator's Brochure will serve as the Reference Safety Information (RSI). The RSI in effect at the start of a Development Safety Update Report (DSUR) reporting period serves as the RSI during the reporting period. For follow-up reports, the RSI in place at the time of occurrence of the 'suspected' Serious Adverse Reaction will be used to assess expectedness. 5.2 Additional Eligibility Criteria For subjects in some countries, such as China, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan, inadequate response to MTX is defined as lack of efficacy after minimum 12 weeks duration of therapy at MTX dose ≥ 7.5 mg/week or as required per local authorities. 5.3 Additional Requirements-France Collection of race and ethnicity information is not required.

For additional details on dispensing study drug in the event of home administration due to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Section 3.11 . Risankizumab will be provided by AbbVie as solution for injection in pre-filled syringes (PFS). Risankizumab will be administered as an initial dose, a second dose 4 weeks later, and q12w thereafter.Study drug administration instructions will be provided separately. 6.2 Packaging and Labeling Study drug packaged in 75 mg PFS will be provided in both open-label and blinded fashion and packaged in cartons containing 1 syringe per carton. Each kit will be labeled as required per local requirements. Each kit label will contain a unique kit number. This kit number is assigned to a subject via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) and encodes the appropriate study drug to be administered at the subjects corresponding study visit. All labels must remain affixed to the study drug at all times and should never be removed for any reason. All blank spaces should be completed by site staff prior to dispensing to subject. Storage and Disposition of Study Drug Risankizumab or placebo PFS must be kept protected from light in the original packaging, in a refrigerator between 2° to 8°C (36° to 46°F). Study drug must not be frozen at any time. The investigational products are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the context of this study. The study drug supplied for this study must be maintained under adequate security and stored under the conditions specified on the label until dispensed for subject use or destroyed on site as appropriate. A temperature log must be maintained for documentation. Page 97 of 128"

Malfunctions or temperature excursions must be reported to the Sponsor immediately upon notice. Study drug should be quarantined and not dispensed until AbbVie or AbbVie Temperature Excursion Management System (ATEMS) deems the drug as acceptable. 6.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups This is a Phase 3, global, multi-center study that will evaluate subjects with moderately to severely active psoriatic arthritis. Period 1 is a 24-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel- group period. Eligible subjects will be randomized to risankizumab or placebo in a 1:1 ratio for Period 1. After the Week 24 assessments are performed, Period 2 begins. During Period 2, all subjects will receive risankizumab. To maintain the blind to the original treatment allocation, treatment at the Week 24 Visit will be blinded: subjects who were randomized to placebo will receive blinded risankizumab, and those randomized to risankizumab will receive 1 dose of blinded placebo. At Week 28 and for the remaining dosing visits all subjects will receive open-label risankizumab 150 mg q12w. At the Screening Visit, all subjects will be assigned a unique subject number through the use of the IRT. Randomization will be stratified by current use of csDMARD (0 vs ≥ 1), number of prior biologic therapies (0 vs ≥ 1), and extent of psoriasis ( ≥ 3% BSA or < 3% BSA) at Baseline. For subjects who do not meet the study selection criteria, the site personnel must login to the IRT system and identify the subject as a screen failure. Subjects who are enrolled will retain their subject number assigned at the Screening Visit throughout the study. Upon receipt of study drug, the site will acknowledge receipt in the IRT system. Contact information and user guidelines for IRT use will be provided to each site. 6.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject Risankizumab 150 mg or matching placebo dose subcutaneously (SC, 2 × 75 mg PFS) administered at Week 0, 4, 16, 24, 28, and q12w thereafter is selected for this study. 6.5 Drug Accountability The investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will administer study drug only to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with the protocol. The study drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the protocol. Page 98 of 128"

JOINT ASSESSMENT Joint counts will be performed by assessor(s) who must be well trained and part of the site personnel. Whenever possible, the same evaluator should perform these assessments at all visits. Number of Tender Joints: The 68 joints assessed for tenderness include the 2 temporomandibular, 2 sternoclavicular, 2 acromioclavicular joints, 2 shoulders, 2 elbows, 2 wrists, 10 metacarpophalangeal, 10 proximal interphalangeal, 8 distal interphalangeal joints of the hands, the 2 hips, 2 knees, 2 ankles 2 mid-tarsal, 10 metatarsophalangeal, and 10 proximal interphalangeal joints of the feet. Joints are to be scored as either tender (1) or not tender (0), replaced (9) or not assessed (99).Number of Swollen Joints: The 66 joints to be examined for swelling are the same as those examined for tenderness, however excluding both hip joints. Joints are to be scored as either swollen (1) or not swollen (0), replaced (9) or not assessed (99).Synovial fluid and/or soft tissue swelling but not bony overgrowth represents a positive result for swollen joint count.

PASI SCORE DEFINITIONS AND USE The PASI score is an established measure of clinical efficacy for psoriasis medications.6 The PASI is a tool which provides a numeric scoring for patients overall psoriasis disease state, ranging from 0 to 72. It is a linear combination of percent of surface area of skin that is affected and the severity of erythema, induration, and desquamation over four body regions. The endpoints used are based on the percent reduction from baseline, generally summarized as a dichotomous outcome based on achieving over an X% reduction (or PASIX), where X is 50, 75, 90, and 100. To calculate the PASI score, the four main body areas are assessed: head (h), trunk (t), upper extremities (u) and lower extremities (l). These correspond to 10, 30, 20 and 40% of the total body area respectively.The area of psoriatic involvement of these four areas (Ah, At, Au, and Al) is given a numerical value: 0 = no involvement, 1 = < 10%, 2 = 10 to < 30%, 3 = 30 to < 50%, 4 = 50 to < 70%, 5 = 70 to < 90%, and 6 = 90 to 100% involvement. The signs of severity, erythema (E), induration (I) and desquamation (D) of lesions are assessed using a numeric scale 0 – 4 where 0 is a complete lack of cutaneous involvement and 4 is the severest possible involvement; scores are made independently for each of the areas, h, t, u and l and represents a composite score for each area. An illustration of judging erythema follows: 0 = no erythema, 1 = slight erythema, 2 = moderate erythema, 3 = marked erythema, and 4 = very marked erythema. The PASI score is calculated according to the following formula:PASI = 0.1(Eh+Ih+Dh)Ah + 0.3(Et+It+Dt)At + 0.2(Eu+Iu+Du)Au + 0.4(El+Il+Dl)Al Page 111 of 128"

LEEDS DACTYLITIS INDEX The LDI basic measures the ratio of the circumference of the affected digit to the circumference of the digit on the opposite hand or foot, using a minimum difference of 10% to define a dactylitic digit.7,8 The ratio of circumference is multiplied by a tenderness score, using a modification of LDI which is a binary score (1 for tender, 0 for non-tender). If both sides are considered involved, or the circumference of the contralateral digit cannot be obtained, AbbVie will input and utilize a circumference provided in the standard reference tables. This modification is referred to as LDI basic and will be applied in this study. The LDI requires a finger circumference gauge or a tape measure to measure digital circumference. Dactylitis Count The dactylitis count is the number of fingers and toes with dactylitis, with a range of 0 – 20.Presence of Dactylitis If dactylitis is present with any finger or toe, the subject is counted as a subject with dactylitis.

The LEI demonstrated substantial to excellent agreement with other scores in the indication of psoriatic arthritis. 9 Enthesitis Count Tenderness on examination is recorded as either present (1) or absent (0) for each of the 6 sites, for an overall score range of 0 – 6. Presence of Enthesitis If enthesitis is present with any of the 6 sites (lateral epicondyle humerus left and right, Achilles tendon insertion left and right and medial condyle femur left and right), the subject is counted as a subject with enthesitis.

PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES BASDAI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index)16 Each question is answered on a 0 to 10 scale. For Questions 1 – 5, 0 means none and 10 means very severe; for Question 6, 0 means 0 hours and 10 means 2 or more hours. All questions refer to last week. 1. How would you describe the overall level of fatigue/tiredness you have experienced? 2. How would you describe the overall level of AS neck, back or hip pain you have had?3. How would you describe the overall level of pain/swelling in joints other than neck, back or hips you have had? 4. How would you describe the overall level of discomfort you have had from any areas tender to touch or pressure? 5. How would you describe the overall level of morning stiffness you have had from the time you wake up? 6. How long does your morning stiffness last from the time you wake up? Calculation of BASDAI: compute the mean of Questions 5 and 6. Calculate the sum of the values of Questions 1 – 4 and add the result to the mean of Questions 5 and 6. Divide the result by 5. Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity17 The patient global assessment VAS will be self-administered by the patient.The patient's global assessment of disease activity will be performed using a horizontal 100 mm VAS, ranging from 0 (very well) to 100 (very poor) after the question: ""Considering all the ways psoriatic arthritis affects you, please indicate with a vertical mark ( | ) through the horizontal line how well you are doing today."" Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) 18 HAQ-DI is a self-reported patient outcome measurement tool commonly used in RA clinical trials to measure physical functioning in RA patients. The HAQ-DI composite score is calculated as the mean of the scores from the 8 following categories with a range of 0 – 3 (0 = no disability; 3 = worst disability): Dressing and Grooming, Rising, Eating, Walking, Hygiene, Reach, Grip, and Activities. The higher the score, the more likely to associate with morbidity and mortality for the RA patient. Under each category there are 2 - 3 items on the amount of difficulty they have in performing specific activities with four response options from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). In addition to these eight categories, there is an AIDS OR DEVICES/HELP FROM OTHER PERSON section (""companion items"") that is used to Page 121 of 128"

Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-Fatigue)19,20 Response options/scale: Answers are based on a 5-point Likert scale. Responses of ""not at all,"" ""a little,"" ""somewhat,"" ""quite a bit,"" and ""very much"" are available for each question, and correspond to scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Recall period for items: 7 days. 1. I feel fatigued. 2. I feel weak all over. 3. I feel listless (""washed out""). 4. I feel tired.5. I have trouble starting things because I am tired. 6. I have trouble finishing things because I am tired. 7. I have energy.8. I am able to do my usual activities.9. I need to sleep during the day. 10. I am too tired to eat. 11. I need help doing my usual activities.12. I am frustrated by being too tired to do the things I want to do. 13. I have to limit my social activity because I am tired. Short Form-36 21,22 The Short Form-36 (SF-36) is a 36-item patient reported measure of overall health. The SF-36 consists of eight domains: !vitality !physical functioning !bodily pain !general health perceptions !physical role functioning !emotional role functioning !social role functioning Page 122 of 128"
