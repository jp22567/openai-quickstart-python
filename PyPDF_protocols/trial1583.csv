13,page_13,"Novartis Confidential Page 14 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2302 1 Introduction 1.1 Background Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common retinal vascular permeabilit y disorder after diabetic retinopathy and is a significant cause of visual impairment. The 5-year, 10-year and 15-year incidences of RVO have been estimated as 0.8, 1.6 and 2.3 per 100 persons, respectivel y (Klein et al 2000; Cugati et al 2006 ; Klein et al 2008 ).Macular edema (ME) is t he most common cause of vision loss in patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) or central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). In anin vivo model, it has been demonstrated that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can increase vascular permeabil ity (Aiello et al 1994) and that intraocular levels of VEGF in the eyes with RVO are elevated (Campochiaro etal2009 ). Previous and current available therapies Until the approval ofranibizumab, the management of ME associated with RVO was largel y based on the results from the Branch Vein Occlusion Study and the Central Vein Occlusion Study , where laser treatment was shown to be effective for visual acuity (VA) gain in patients with BRVO but not in those with CRVO (TheBranch Vein Occlusion Study 1984 ; TheCentral Vein Occlusion Study 1995 ). Laser photocoagulation was then the standard of care in patients with BRVO despite many patients failing to gain vision but for vision loss associated with CRVO there was no proven effective therapy (Finkelstein 1996). Pharmacologic treatment of RVO began with the use of corticosteroids and the approval of the intravitreal dexamethasone sustained -release implant (Ozurdex®) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2009 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2010 ( Haller et al 2010 ). More recentl y ,anti-VEGF therapies have revolutionized the treatment of ME secondary toRVO and are currently the standard of care in this indication as VEGF is a major mediator for ME in RVO. The most commonly used VEGF inhibitors, i.e. bevacizumab (Avastin®), afliber cept (Eylea®) and ranibizumab (Lucentis®) have demonstrated compelling evidence for resolution of ME and improvement of VA subsequent to the treatment with an anti-VEGF (Rabena et al 2007 ; Campochiaro et al 2010 ; Clark et al 2016). Ranibizumab (0.5 mg) was globally approved (2010 by theFDA, 2011 by the Committee on Herbal Medicinal Products (CHMP) and 2013 by the Pharma ceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA)) for the treatment of ME due to BRVO and CRVO, based on the results of 2 Phase III studies (BRAVO for BRVO and CRUI SE for CRVO) (Campochiaro et al2010; Brown et al 2010 ). These studies showed that approximately 60% of BRVO and 48% of CRVO patients treated with monthly ranibizumab gained at least 15 letters of VA at 6 months, compared with 29% and 17% of those treated with sham, respectivel y.The VA gain was maintained on average until Month 12 using a pro re nata (PRN) treatment regimen, which was based on VA and anatomic parameters. Aflibercept (2 mg) was approved for the treatment of ME following RVO at a global level (2014 by the FDA, 2015 by the CHMP and PMDA) based on the results of 3 Phase III studies: COPERNI CUS and GALILEO for CRVO (Pielen et al 2017 ) and VIBRANT for BRVO (Clark et al 2016 ). In these studies, approximately 60% of CRVO patients treated with monthl y aflibercept gained ≥ 15 letters from baseline versus 17% in the sham group. Approximately 53%"
14,page_14,"Novartis Confidential Page 15 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2302 of BRVO patients treated with monthly aflibercept gained ≥ 15 letters from baseline versus 27% in the laser g roup. Currently available anti -VEGF treatments require frequent regular intravitreal (IVT) injections which can be burdensome to patients and health care professionals. Therefore, an unmet medical need to reduce the treatment burden with an effective alter native still exists. Brolucizumab Brolucizumab, formerl y known as RTH258 and ESBA1008, is a humanized single -chain fragment variable (scFv) that binds to VEGF -A (i.e. interferes with activation of VEGF -R1 and R2 on endothelial cells) with a molecular weigh t of ~26 kDa. It is also being developed for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). The characteristics of brolucizumab allow delivery of a high molar dose via intravitreal injection. Higher molar doses are expected to lead to longer presence of relevant drug levels in the retina. In addition, a low molecular weight and high concentration gradient between the vitreous and the retina may increase and prolong drug distribution to the target site of action, supporting longer effective control of disease activity . This could potentially translate into a more durable efficacy and a reduced treatment burden (number of injections) for the patient and health care professional. Broluciz umab in nAMD In a single ascending dose Phase I study (C-10- 083), the median time until patients fulfilled protocol defined criteria for receipt of standard of care treatment was 30 days longer for brolucizumab 6 mg (P = 0.036) versus ranibizumab, with themaximum effect on best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central subfield thickness (CSFT) reached on Week 6 for brolucizumab versus Week 4 for ranibizumab. In a separate repeat dosing Phase II study (C- 12-006, OSPREY) comparing brolucizumab 6 mg (n = 44 ) every 8 weeks (q8w), then every 12 weeks (q12w) administration, i.e. administration every q8w and q12w, respectivel y, against aflibercept (q8w administration, n = 45), brolucizumab achieved comparable visual outcome during the loading and q8w phase, with a lower number of patients requiring additional rescue treatments (5 out of 44 versus 10 out of 45, respectively). Brolucizumab demonstrated a trend for greater improvements and more stability in retinal anatomy during the 4 cycles of q8w dosing (up to We ek 40), e.g. simultaneous resolution of intraretinal and subretinal fluid which was achieved in 61% of brolucizumab patients versus 35% of aflibercept patients at Week 40. In the Phase III studies RTH258- C001 (HAWK) and RTH258- C002 (HARRI ER), brolucizumab demonstrated non-inferiority to aflibercept in mean change in BCVA from baseline to Week 48 in both trials using a non-inferiorit y margin (NIM) of 4 letters. These results were achieved while a majority of patients on brolucizumab 6 mg –56% in HAWK and 51 % in HARRI ER –were maintained on a q12w (every 12 weeks) dosing interval following the loading phase (Baseline to Week 8) through Week 48. Significantly fewer patients on brolucizumab had disease activity at Week 16 (head -to-head comparison based on a matching dosing regimen) with a relative decrease of 30% (P = 0.0022) versus aflibercept. Significantl y fewer patients on brolucizumab had intraretinal fluid (I RF) and/or subretinal fluid (SRF), with a 35% and 33% reduction relative to aflibercept at Week 16 (P < 0.001 for both) in HAWK and HARRI ER, respectivel y, and a 31% and 41% reduction relative to aflibercept at Week 48 in HAWK and HARRIER, respectivel y (P < 0.0001 for both). Brolucizumab 6 mg achieved"
15,page_15,"Novartis Confidential Page 16 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2302 superior reductions in CSFT versus aflibercept in both the head -to-head and maintenance phases (P = 0.0016 and P = 0.0023 at Week 16 and Week 48, respectively , in HAWK; P < 0.0001 at both Week 16 and Week 48 in HARRIER). Brolucizumab safety was comparable to aflibercept, with the overall incidence of adverse events (AEs) balanced across all treatment groups in both studies. Since the first marketing authorization approval in Oct-2019 for the treatment of nAMD, adverse events of retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion, that may result in severe vision loss and ty pically in the presence of intraocular inflammation, have been reported from post-marketing experience with brolucizumab (Beovu®).Considering these events, the overall risk/benefit assessment remains positive. Summary Ranibizumab, afliberc ept and brolucizumab all inhibit the activity of VEGF -A with all three having proven efficacy in the treatment of nAMD while both ranibizumab and aflibercept hav e also previously demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of patients with ME secondary to BRVO and CRVO. These findings support the evaluation of brolucizumab in RVO patients. Furthermore, the efficacy profile of brolucizumab in nAMD patients indicates a potential of brolucizumab to differentiate versus existing anti -VEGFs on duration of action and anatomical efficacy in CRVO patients: The longer duration of action is supported by the following outcomes of the Phase I and II nAMD studies with brolucizumab 6 mg dose: Maximum improvements in BCVA and CSFT at Week 4 for ranibizumab versus Week 6 for br olucizumab Greater CSFT stability during q8w maintenance versus aflibercept Fewer rescue treatments versus aflibercept in q8w phase The aforementioned results were confirmed b y the nAMD (HAWK and HARRI ER) 48- week stud y results, which demonstrated: Visual gains at Week 48 achieved with 56% (HAWK) and 51% (HARRIER) of patients treated following a q12w regimen after the loading phase Superior reduction in CSFT versus aflibercept The potential for less frequent injections of brolucizumab as compared to aflibercept Lower proportion of patients with intra- and/or subretinal fluid Previous studies demonstrating efficacy with anti-VEGFs on CRVO combined with the evidence detailed above support a loading phase with a q4w (i.e. every 4 weeks) regimen followed by an individualized flexible treatment (IFT) regimen in the maintenance phase based ondisease stability forbrolucizumab, thus potentially reducing the injection burden. These considerations support the initiation of a Phase III program to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of brolucizumab in the treatment of patients with ME secondary to CRVO with the objective to evaluate the potential to reduce the treatment burden for patients."

All medications, procedures and significant non -drug therapies (including physical therap y and blood transfusions) administere d after the subject was enrolled into the study must be recorded on the appropriate eCRFs. Each concomitant medication must be individually assessed against all exclusion criteria/prohibited medication.

The Subject No. consists of the Center Number (4 digit number for Center No. as assigned by Novartis to the investigative site) with a sequential subject number suffixed to it (3 digit number for Subject No.), so that each subject is numbered uniquely across the entire database. Upon signing the informed consent form, the subject is assigned to the next sequential Subject No. available in the electronic data capture (EDC) s ystem. Subjects who have been screen failures but are rescreened (see Section 8.1) will be assigned a new Subject No. if rescreening occurs bey ond 14 day s from the original screening date. 6.3.2 Treatment assignment, randomization All screened subjects must be added to the Interactive Response Technology (IRT) sy stem. At the Baseline Visit/Day 1 all eligible subjects will be randomized via IRT to 1 of the treatment arms in a ratio of 1:1. The randomization will be stratified by the following demographic groups: Japanese region, Chinese region (including Taiwan and Hong Kong) and rest of world (RoW) region. The unmasked investigator or his/her delegate will contact the IRT after receiving confirmation from the masked investigator that the subject fulfills all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The IRT will assign a randomization number to the subject, which will be used to link the subject to a treatment arm and will specify a unique medication number for the study treatment"
27,page_27,"Novartis Confidential Page 28 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2302 packages (each containing 1 vial) to be dispensed to the subject. The randomization number will not be communicated to subject or site users. The randomization numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased an d concealed from subjects and investigator staff. A subject randomization list will be produced using a validated system that automates the random assignment of subject numbers to randomization numbers. These randomization numbers are linked to the differe nt treatment arms, which in turn are linked to medication numbers. A separate medication list will be produced by or under the responsibility of Novartis Global Clinical Supply (GCS) using a validated system that automates the random assignment of medicati on numbers to packs containing the study treatment. The randomization scheme for subjects will be reviewed and approved by a m ember of the Randomization Office. 6.4 Treatment masking The intent of masking is to limit the occurrence of conscious and unconscious bias in the conduct and interpretation of the clinical study . Bias could arise from the influence that the knowledge of a specific treatment assignment may have on the recruitment and allocation of subjects, their subsequent care, the assessment of endpoi nts, the handling of withdrawals, and so on. The essential aim of masking, therefore, is to prevent identification of the treatments by the investigator, subject, and others associated with the conduct of the study until all such opportunities for bias are no longer present. This study will be double -masked, with subjects randomized to be treated with brolucizumab 6 mg or aflibercept 2 mg. The clinical study team will be masked to treatment assignments until Week 52 Database lock and will be unmasked once the Week 52 Database lock is reached. However, masking to the original treatment assignment will be maintained at the site level (patients, masked stud y site personnel, masked monitors) until the end of the study. Unmasking of investigators and site personn el directly involved in the conduct of the study will only occur in case of subject emergencies (see Section 6.6.2), and then at the time of the final analysis (see Section 4.4), at the conclu sion of the study . In the event of a medical emergency or an adverse event (AE) during the study where the knowledge of subject treatment is required (e.g. in case of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR)), an investigator will have the ability to unmask the treatment assignment for a specific subject. The investigator should notify the Sponsor prior to unmasking a subject, if there is sufficient time. Further, the Sponsor must be informed whenever the randomization code is broken and be inf ormed about the reasons for unmasking. Each site must have both masked and unmasked investigators available. The investigator who performs the injection will be unmasked to the treatments as will any other site personnel who have been delegated responsibility for working with the investigational product. The unmasked site personnel and unmasked injecting investigator must not perform BCVA assessments, complete ophthalmic examination, disease stability assessments or administer the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire -25 (NEI VFQ -25). Also, the unmasked site personnel and unmasked injecting physician must not perform assessment of any ocular or non-ocular safet y parameters, or assess causalit y of AEs for subjects during the course o f the study ."
28,page_28,
29,page_29,"Novartis Confidential Page 30 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2302 6.6.2 Emergency breaking of assigned treatment code Emergency code breaks must only be undertaken when required to in order to treat the subject safel y. Most often, study treatment discontinuation and knowledge of the possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study subject who presents with an emergenc y condition. Emergency treatment code breaks are performed using the IRT. When the investigator contacts the IRT system to break a treatment code for a subject, he/she must provide the requested subject identify ing information and confirm the necessit y to break the treatment code for the subject. The investigator will then receive details of the investigational drug treatment for the specified subject and a fax or email confirming this information. The s ystem will automatically inform the Novartis monitor for the site and the study team that the code has been broken. If the treatment code needs to be broken in the interest of subject safet y, the investigator is encouraged to contact an appropriate Sponsor representative prior to unmasking if there is suffici ent time. It is the unmasked or masked investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a dependable procedure in place to allow access to the IRT/code break cards at any time in case of emergency . The investigator will provide: protocol number name ( if available) subject number In addition, oral and written information to the subject must be provided on how to contact his/her backup in cases of emergency, or when he/she is unavailable, to ensure that un -masking can be performed at an y time. The appropriate personnel from the site and Sponsor will assess whether study treatment should be discontinued for an y subject whose treatment code has been broken for any reason. 6.7 Preparation and dispensation Each study site will be supplied with study drug inpackaging as described under investigational and comparator drugs (Section 6.1.1). For both brolucizumab and aflibercept, the study drug packaging has a 2-part label (base plus tear-off label). A unique medication number is printed on each part of this label, which corresponds to 1 of the treatment arms. Unmasked study personnel will identify the study medication kits to dispense to the subject by contacting the IRT and obtaining the medication number(s). Immediatel y before dispensing the medication kit to the subject, unmasked study personnel will detach the outer part of the label from the packaging and affix it to the source document (Drug Label Form) for that subject's unique subject number. 6.7.1 Handling of study treatment Study treatment must be received by a designated unmasked person at the study site, handled and stored safel y and properly and kept in a secured location to which only the unmasked investigator and designated site personnel have access. Upon receipt, all study treatment must be registered in the IRT sy stem and stored according to the instructions specified on the labels and in the Investigator’s Brochure. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in accordance"
30,page_30,"Novartis Confidential Page 31 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2302 with the protocol. Technical complaints are tobe reported to the respective Novartis Country Organization (CO) Quality Assurance. Medication labels will be in the local language and comply with the legal requirements of each country . They will include storage conditions for the study treatment but no information about the subject except for the medication number . The unmasked study personnel must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of study treatment in a drug accountabilit y log. Monitoring of drug accountability will be perform ed by unmasked monitors during site visits or remotel y and at the completion of the trial. At the conclusion of the study, and as appropriate during the course of the study, the unmasked study personnel will return all unused study treatment, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug accountability log to the unmasked Novartis monitor or to the Novartis address provided in the investigator folder at each site. 6.7.2 Instruction for prescribing and taking study treatment All kits of study treatment assigned b y the IRT will be recorded/databased in the I RT s ystem. There will be 2 treatment phases for IVT injections: Loading Phase In the loading phase, treatment with either brolucizumab (6 mg) or aflibercept (2 mg) will occur every 4 weeks for six (6) consecutive injections (baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20). Every effort should be made to ensure that the subject adheres to the visit/treatment schedule. Individualized Flexible Treatment (IFT) Phase The IFT phase is defined as follows (see Figure 6 -1): The assessment of disease stability is performed at each visit by the masked investigator as of Week 24, and is guided by the stability of visual acuit y and/or anatomical parameters (e.g. subretinal fluid, intraretinal fluid , retinal thickness (CSFT)), within the previous 3 visits. As long as there is no disease stability , subjects will receive active injections every 4 weeks. When disease stability is reached, treatment is interrupted. The IRT system will allocate active /sham injections as per the masked investigator’s assessment of disease stability . A disease stability assessment will also be performed at Week 76/EOS visit, however no stud y treatment will be administered. Brolucizumab or aflibercept (or sham) should be administered in the study eye on the day of the study visit or, if this is not possible, the recommendation is for this to be performed within 3 days after the occurrence of the study visit (except for Baseline/Day 1, in which case study treatment administ ration should occur within the next 24 hours), or no later than within the visit window as described in Section 3and Section 8. If assessments and treatments take place on the same day, treatment must occur after completion of the efficacy assessments described in Section 8.3 and pre-injection safet y measures (tonometry , slit lamp and fundus examinations)"
31,page_31,"Novartis Confidential Page 32 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2302 described in Section 8.4.3 . If study visit assessments and a corresponding treatment occur on separate days, a repeat safet y check -up should be performed prior to treatment of the eye and results documented in the source documents. If any safety concern arises related to the study eye that, in the opinion of the investigator, may be further impacted by the study treatment or injection procedure, treatment needs to be cancelled. Any adverse events must be recorded in the eCRF. The assessment of the masked/evaluating investigator will be p assed to the unmasked/treating investigator or delegate in order to be entered in the IRT system and obtain the applicable treatment, active or sham, as assigned b y IRT. Figure 6-1 Dose and treatment schedule V:Visit; BL: Baseline; IFT: Individualized Flexible Treatment The IVT injection procedure for brolucizumab and aflibercept, including aseptic and antimicrobial requirements, will be performed according to local clin ical practice. The sham injection should mimic an IVT injection including the aseptic and antimicrobial requirements. The tip of the sham injection syringe (the hub without a needle) will be placed on the ey e for the approximate amount of time it would take to perform an IVT injection. IVT injection will be performed b y the unmasked investigator. IVT injection is contraindicated in subjects with active ocular or periocular infections and in subjects with active intraocular inflammation (IOI); therefore, the investigators must verify that these conditions are not present in the study eye prior to every injection. If any signs of intraocular inflammation are present, then an IVT injection must notbe performed. Additional ophthalmic examination and imaging should be performed to evaluate IOI (see Section 8.4.3). If IOI is confirmed, subjects should be treated for IOI according to clinical practice. From Week 24 to Week 72 inclusi ve, a sham treatment will be performed to maintain subject masking in case treatment with brolucizumab or aflibercept is not deemed necessary by the investigator. For the sham treatment the tip of an injection syringe (the hub without a needle) will be use d."

All data obtained from these assessments must be supported in the subject’s source documentation. Data must be entered as appropriate in the eCRF in a timel y manner (see Section 11.1 ). A planned study visit schedule will be established at Baseline/Day 1, randomization (first day of treatment), for all subjects. All post-baseline and/or subsequent scheduled visits will be calculated based on the Day 1 visit date. All efforts should be made to adhere to all scheduled visits and assessments as outlined in the assessment schedule ( Table 8 -1). A ± 7 day s visit window is allowed (except for Baseline/Day 1), should the subject be unable to return per scheduled visit. All efforts should be made to revert back to the planned visit schedule taking into consideration the restrictions on the minimum treatment interval for the study treatment, i.e. 2 consecutive injections should be spaced b y at least 21 day s. For a given protocol visit (except for Baseline/Day 1), assessments can be performed on 2 consecutive day s in which both day s must occur within the ± 7 day s visit window. Treatment is intended to be administered on the day of study visit or, if this is not possible, within 3 days after the study visit at which the per-protocol assessments took place (except Baseline/Day 1, in which case study treatment administration should occur within the next 24 hours). For all visits, efficacy assessments (Section 8.3 ) and safet y assessments (Section 8.4 ) should be performed prior to any administration of study treatment and/or rescue medication. Missed or rescheduled visits should not lead to automatic discontinuation. Subjects who prematurel y discontinue thestudy for any reason should be scheduled for a visit as soon as possible, at which time all of the assessments listed for the End of Study final visit will be performed. If the COVID -19 pandemic limits or prevents on -site study visits, study treatment could not be administered and other study assessments may not be performed . Alternative methods of safet y monitoring may be implemented. Depending on local regulations, site capabilities and subject ’s visit status in the study , phone calls or virtual contacts (e.g. teleconsult) can be performed for safet y follow -up for the duration of the pandemic, until it is safe for the subject to visit the site again."

For the purpose of screening, fluorescein angiograph y (FA) images from a previous routine evaluation may be used as long as FA was performed within 3 days of the screening visit using Central Reading Center (CRC) -certified equipment and technician/investigator. One-time reassessment of subjects is allowed, except for the purpose of capturing new BCVA assessments that previously failed to qualify the subject. As long as testing can be repeated within 14 days of the first screening, the other screening assessments do not need to be repeated. If rescreening is to occur beyond 14 da ys from the original screening visit date, then the s ubject must be reconsented and all screening procedures must be repeated. Medical judgment should be exercised to ensure that treatment of CRVO is not withheld in order for a subject to participate in the stud y. 8.1.1 Information to be collected on screening fai lures Subjects who sign an informed consent form and who are subsequentl y found to be ineligible prior to randomization will be considered a screen failure. The reason for screen failure should be recorded on the appropriate eCRF page. The demographic information, informed consent, inclusion/exclusion and disposition eCRF pages must also be completed for screen failure subjects. No other data will be entered into the clinical database for subjects who are screen failures, unless the subject experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) during the screening phase (see SAE Section 10.1.2 for reporting details). Adverse events that are not SAEs will be followed by the investigator and collected only in the source data. If the subje ct is not eligible to be randomized, the IRT must be notified within 2 days of the screen fail that the subject was not randomized. 8.2 Subject demographics/other baseline characteristics Country -specific regulations should be considered for the collection of demographic and baseline characteristics in alignment with eCRF.

Clinically relevant findings that are present prior to signing informed consent must be included in the eCRF capturing Medical History. Significant findings identified after p roviding written informed consent which meet the definition of an Adverse Event must be recorded on the appropriate AE eCRF page. Vital signs Vital signs include assessment of sitting blood pressure (systolic and diastolic pressure in mmHg) and pulse rate (beats per minute) and will be collected at all visits. In case there is an elevated blood pressure measurement as specified in the exclusion criteria, at the screening and baseline visits, the blood pressure measurement should be repeated after 20 minute s. If the repeat measurement is elevated, then the subject is not eligible to be enrolled into the study. On days when study drug is administered, vital signs will be measured before administration of study medication. The results will be recorded in the e CRF. 8.4.1 Laboratory evaluations A central laboratory will be used for anal ysis of all specimens collected at screening, Week 24, Week 52 and Week 76/EOS visit. Details on the collections, shipment of the samples and reporting of the results by the central laboratory are provided to investigators in the central laboratory manual. If the COVID -19 pandemic limits or prevents on-site study visits, the collection of samples may be modified by Novartis if applicable and if modified, will be communicated to the Investigator.

Aserum pregnancy test will be conducted for all women of child- bearing potential to assess pregnancy before inclusion into the study at Screening visit and then at Week 52 and Week 76/EOS visit. During the study , monthl yurine pregnancy testing will be performed at visits when serum pregnancy testing will not be conducted. Results of all pregnancy testing must be available as source documentation. Assessment of fertility Medical documentation of oophorectom y, hysterectom y, or tubal ligation must be retained as source documents. Subsequent hormone level assessment to confirm the woman is not of child- bearing potential must also be available as source documentation in the following cases: 1.Surgical bilateral oophorectomy without a hy sterectomy 2.Reported 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile. In the absence of the above medical documentation, Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) testing is required of an y female subject, regardless of reported reproductive/menopausal status at screening/baseline. 8.4.3 Ophthalmic examination The ophthalmic exam will consist of the following: Intraocular pressure (IOP) will be assessed in the study eye, pre -dose and post -dose at every scheduled visit . The method used for measuring a subject’s IOP must remain consistent throughout the study .In the fellow ey e, IOP will be assessed at screening, Week 24, Week 52 and Week 76/EOS visit. The values recorded in mmHg for either ey e will be entered into the eCRF. Post-dose I OP should be assessed within 60 minutes after every IVT/sham injection and, if ≥ 25 mmHg, assessment should be repeated until back to normal. Treatment and close monitoring of an elevated IOP should be performed by the investigator according to local clinical practice. Anterior biomicroscopy (slit lamp examination) will be completed at every (scheduled and unscheduled) visit to examine the anterior segment structures (e.g. ey elids/lashes, conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, lens and anterior part of the vitreous) of the study eye (fellow ey e will be examined at screening, Week 24, Week 52 and Week 76/EOS visit and at the discretion of the investigator). The results of the examination of either ey e must be recorded in the source documents. Slit lamp examination must be carefull y performed before each study treatment. If there areany sign sof IOI, severity of anterior chamber cells and flare should be assessed according to the standardization of uveitis nomenclature (SUN) working group grad ing system (Jabs et al 2005). The test results will be recorded in the source documents (e.g. ophthalmic examination tool) and captured in the appropriate eCRF as applicable . Posterior segment (indirect fundus) exam ination will be conducted b y the investigator at the screening visit for both ey es. An examination of the peripheral retina must also be"

As of baseline visit, the posterior segment examination will be performed at every visit in the study ey e (fellow ey e will be examined at Week 24, Week 52 and Week 76/EOS visit and at the discretion of the investigator ). The results of the examination of either ey e must be recorded in the source documents. Posterior segment examination must be performed carefully before each study treatment. The results of the examination including an y abnormalities (e.g. vitreous cells/haze, retinal tear/detachment, hemorrhage and vascular occlusio n, vasculitis, etc.) should be recorded in the source documents. If there areany signs of IOI, vitreous cells and haze should be assessed using the National I nstitutes of Health (NIH)grading sy stem (Nussenblatt et al 1985). The outcome of the examination will be documented in the source document (e.g. ophthalmic examination tool) and appropriate eCRF page as applicable. Pupil dilation for slit lamp and posterior segment examination is optional according to local practice. Clinically significant abnormal findings (as judged by the masked investigator) from slit lamp or posterior segment exam ination should be recorded as an AE in the eCRF. Instruct the patient to contact the site for any changes in vision or any sympt oms of inflammation between scheduled visits. Every effort should be made to bring the subject for immediate examination. When IOI, retinal vasculitis, and/or retinal artery occlusion (RAO) is present or suspected during a visit, investigators must perform thorough ophthalmic examination, and will conduct OCT, fluorescein angiograph y and color fundus photograph y (preferabl y wide- field or with peripheral sweeps). These additional assessments will be documented in the source and appropriate eCRF pages as appl icable. The images are requested to be uploaded onto the CRC portal. 8.4.4 Appropriateness of safety measurements The safet y assessments selected are standard for this indication and subject population. If there are an y signs of IOI, additional assessment will be performed as described in Section 8.4.3. 8.5 Additional assessments 8.5.1 Clinical Outcome A ssessments (COA s) 8.5.1.1 Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) The impact of brolucizumab and aflibercept on subject visual function will also be assessed by a visual function questionnaire using the National Eye Institute NEI VFQ -25 which is a validated instrument that has been used in many studies of patients with RVO. The NEI VFQ - 25 was developed to address the need to measure a patient’s subjective assessment of vision - related Quality of Life (QoL) ( Mangione et al2001 ). It is part of the 51 -item NEI -VFQ which was developed based on feedback from patients to measure vision -targeted functioning an d the impact of vision problems on Health- Related Quality of Life (HRQL) across a number of common eye conditions. This allowed the developers to identify the content areas and aspects of visual disability that were most important and relevant to patients with age-related macular"
43,page_43,"Novartis Confidential Page 44 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2302 degeneration (AMD). In addition to its use in measuring the treatment effect on vision -related function in AMD patients, the NEI VFQ -25 has been used to measure treatment benefits in patients with DME ( Klein et al 2001) and RVO ( Varma et al 2012). The NEI VFQ - 25 will be administered to subjects at sites where validated local language versions are available and where they are approved by the corresponding IRB/I EC. At baseline and Weeks 24, 52 and 76 (EOS), the questionnaire should be administered to subjects before completing any other study procedures of the visit. Answers to NEI VFQ -25 will be captured electronically independentl y from the eCRF (in a dedicate d database). The subject’s answers to the interview questions will be reviewed b y masked site staff. A detailed training manual relating to the administrative procedures of the questionnaires will be provided to the sites. Completed questionnaires will be reviewed and assessed by the masked/evaluating investigator for responses that may indicate potential AEs or SAEs before completion of the study visit. If AEs or SAEs are confirmed, the evaluating investigator should not encourage the subject to change res ponses reported in the completed questionnaires. Evaluating investigators should follow reporting instructions outlined in Section 10 of the protocol. 8.5.2 Imaging Refer toSection 8.3.2 Optical coherence tomograph y . 8.5.3 Anti-drug antibodies (immunogenicity ) Anti- drug antibodies (ADA) levels will be assessed from subjects assigned to brolucizumab treatment only. However, in order to maintain masking, collection of blood samples for ADA assessment will be performed in both treatment arms (brolucizumab and aflibercept) at screening, Weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, 52 and 76 (EOS). Samples collected from subjects assigned to aflibercept treatment will notbe assayed for ADA nor for systemic exposure. Systemic exposure of brolucizumab will be measured concomitantly with ADA levels for interpretation purposes. No pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined from brolucizumab sy stemic exposure. Additional pharmacod ynamic assessment may be conducted on the samples wherever permitted by local regulation. Blood draws should take place prior to the injection/sham procedures. A standardized procedure for the collection, numbering, processing, storage and shipment of these blood samples is provided b y the central laboratory and details can be found in the central laboratory manual."

A subject will be considered to have completed the study when the subject has completed the last visit planned in the protocol. The investigator and/or referring phy sician will recommend the appropriate follow -up medical care, if needed, for all subjects who are prematurely withdrawn from the study . 9.1.1 Discontinuation of study tre atment Discontinuation of study treatment for a subject occurs when study treatment is stopped earlier than the protocol planned duration, and can be initiated by either the subject or the investigator. The investigator must discontinue study treatment fora given subject if he/she believes that continuation would negatively impact the subject's well -being. Study treatment must be discontinued under the following circumstances: Subject/guardian decision Pregnancy (see Sectio n 8.4.2 and Section 10.1.4) Use of prohibited treatment (see Section 6.2.2) Any situation in which continuation with study treatment might result in a safet y risk to the subject Following emergency unmasking (see Section 6.6.2 ) If premature discontinuation of study treatment occurs, the following should be done as appropriate:"
45,page_45,"Novartis Confidential Page 46 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2302 The investigator must contact the IRT to register the subject’s discontinuation from study treatment. The investigator should make a reasonable effort to understand and document the primary reason for the subject’s premature discontinuation of study treatment using the appropriate eCRF page. Subjects who prematurely discontinue study treatment for an y reason, except for withdrawal of consent (refer to Section 9.1.2), should continue in the study with all the scheduled visits and assessments (except disease stability assessment, administr ation of study treatment, post -injection assessment and adherence to prohibited medication list) until EOS, at the discretion of the investigator or the subject. Subjects who decide not to participate in the study further should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study , UNLESS they withdraw their consent (see Section 9.1.2). Where possible, subjects should return for the EOS visit assessments to be performed as scheduled in Table 8- 1. If a subj ect fails to return for study visits without stating an intention to discontinue or withdraw, the investigator must show ""due diligence"" by documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the subject, e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. A subject should not be considered as lost to follow -up until due diligence has been completed (see Section 9.1.3). If the subject cannot or is unwilling to return at any visit(s), the site staff should maintain regular telephone contact with the subject, or with a person pre -designated by the subject. This telephone contact should preferabl y be done according to the stud y visit schedule. After premature stud y treatment discontinuation, at a minimum, in abbreviat ed visits, the following data should be collected at clinic visits or via telephone/email contact: New/concomitant treatments Adverse events/Serious Adverse Events In the event that premature study treatment discontinuation occurs because treatment code has been broken, please refer to Section 6.6.2 . 9.1.1.1 Replacement policy Subjects who started treatment but prematurely discontinued treatment and/or study will not be replaced. 9.1.2 Withdrawal of informed consent Subjects may volunta rily withdraw consent to participate in the study for any reason at any time. Withdrawal of consent occurs onl y when a subject: Does not want to participate in the study anymore, and Does not allow further collection of personal data. In this situation, the investigator should make a reasonable effort (e.g. telephone, e -mail, letter) to understand the primary reason for the subject’s decision to withdraw his/her consent and record this information."
46,page_46,"Novartis Confidential Page 47 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2302 Study treatment must be discontinued and no further assessm ents conducted, and the data that would have been collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing. The investigator must contact the IRT to register the subject’s withdrawal of consent. Further attempts to contact the subject are not allowed unless safety findings require communicating or follow -up. All efforts should be made to complete the assessments prior to study withdrawal. A final evaluation at the time of the subject’s study withdrawal should be made as detailed in the assessment table ( Table 8 -1). Novartis will continue to keep and use collected study information (including any data resulting from the anal ysis of a subject’s samples until their time of withdrawal) according to applicable law. For US and Japan : All biological samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal may still be used for further testing/analy sis in accordance with the terms of this protocol and of the informed consent form. For EU and RoW : All biological samples not yet analyzed at the time of withdrawal will no longer be used, unless permitted by applicable law. They will be stored according to applicable legal requirements. 9.1.3 Lost to follow -up For subjects whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stati ng an intention to discontinue or withdraw, the investigator must show ""due diligence"" by documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the subject, e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc . A subject should not be considered as lost to follow -up until due diligence has been completed. 9.1.4 Early study termination by the sponsor The study can be terminated by Novartis at any time. Reasons for early termination may include: Unexpected, significant, or unacceptable safet y risk to subjec ts enrolled in the study Decision based on recommendation from the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) after review of safet y and efficacy data Discontinuation of study drug development Practical reasons, including slow enrollment Regulatory or medical reasons In taking the decision to terminate, Novartis will alway s consider the subject welfare and safet y. Should early termination be necessary, subjects must be seen as soon as possible and treated as a prematurely withdrawn subject. The investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subject’s interests. The investigator or sponsor depending on local regulation will be responsible for informing IRBs/IECs of the early termination of the trial."
47,page_47,"Novartis Confidential Page 48 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2302 9.2 Stud y completion and post -study treatment Study completion is defined as when the last subject finishes their EOS visit, and any repeat assessments associated with this visit have been documented and followed -up appropriate ly by the Investigator or, in the event of an early study termination decision, the date of that decision. After stud y completion the subject might receive standard of care if needed. 10 Safety monitoring and reporting 10.1 Definition of adverse events and reporting requirements 10.1.1 Adverse events An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g. any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), sy mptom or disease) in a subject or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study . Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causall y associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product. The investigator has the responsibility for managing the safet y of individu al subject and identify ing adverse events. Novartis qualified medical personnel will be readily available to advise on trial related medical questions or problems. The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by non -directive questioning of the subject at each visit during the study. Adverse events may also be detected when they are volunteered b y the subject during or between visits or through physical examination findings, laboratory test findings, or other assessments. Adverse events must be recorded in the Adverse Events eCRF under the signs, symptoms, or diagnosis associated with them, accompanied by the following information (as far as possible) (if the event is serious refer to Section 10.1.2): 1.the severit y grade mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities severe: prevents normal activities 2.its relationship to the study treatment or the ocular injecti on procedure. If the event is due to lack of efficacy or progression of underl ying illness (i.e. progression of the study indication) the assessment of causalit y will usually be ‘Not suspected’. The rationale for this guidance is that the symptoms of a lac k of efficacy or progression of underly ing illness are not caused b y the trial drug, they happen in spite of its administration and/or both lack of efficacy and progression of underly ing disease can only be evaluated meaningfully by an anal ysis of treatmen t arms, not on a single subject 3.its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing, an outcome of not recovered/not resolved must be reported"

All adverse events must be treated appropriatel y. Treatment may include one or more of the following: no action taken (e.g. further observation only ) (investigationa l) treatment interrupted/withdrawn concomitant medication or non- drug therap y given subject hospitalized/subject's hospitalization prolonged (see Section 10.1.2 for definition of SAE) 6.itsoutcome not recovered/not resolved; recovered/resolved; recovered/resolved with sequelae; fatal; or unknown. Conditions that were alread y present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in medical history of the subject. Adverse events (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underly ing signs and s ymptoms. Adverse event monitoring should be continued until 30 days after last administration of study treatment. Once an adverse event is detected, it must be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent (e.g. continuing at the end of the study ), and assessment must be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of an y changes in severity, the suspected rela tionship to the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. Information about adverse drug reactions for the investigational drug can be found in the Investigator Brochure (IB). Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria: they induce clinical signs or sy mptoms they are considered clinically significant they require therapy Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results must be identified through a review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non -typical in subjects with the underly ing disease. Investigators have the responsibility for managing the safety of individual subjects and identify ing adverse events. Clinically notable laboratory values are included in Section16.1."
49,page_49,"Novartis Confidential Page 50 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2302 10.1.2 Serious adverse events An SAE is defined as any adverse event (appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing) undesirable sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s)) which meets any one of the following criteria: fatal life-threatening Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (please refer to the I CH-E2D Guidelines). results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity constitutes a congenital anomaly /birth defect requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless hospitalization is for: routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the subject’s gener al condition treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission is medically significant, e.g. defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might jeopardize the subject or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Such events should be considered as “medicall y significant”. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse (please refer to the ICH- E2D Guidelines). All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other seriousness criteria are not met . Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction. All reports ofintentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered serious adverse event irrespective if a clinical event has occurred. 10.1.3 SAE reporting To ensure subject safet y, every SAE, regardless of causalit y, occurring after the subject has provided infor med consent and until 30 daysafter the last study visit must be reported to"

Detailed instructions regarding the submission process and requirements are to be found in the investigator folder p rovided to each site. All follow -up information for the SAE including information on complications, progression of the initial SAE and recurrent episodes must be reported as follow -up to the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving th e follow -up information. An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one must be reported separatel y as a new event. If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Broch ure or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study treatment, aChief Medical Office & Patient Safety (CMO & PS)Department associate may urgentl y require further information from the investigator for health authority reportin g. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same study treatment that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and r eported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with EU Guidance 2011/C 172/01 or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries. Any SAEs experienced after the 30 day period after the last stud y visit should only be reported to Novartis Safet y if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to study treatment. 10.1.4 Pregnancy reporting To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy occurring after signing the informed consent must be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence (female participants only ). The pregnancy (for female participants) should be followed upto determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. Pregnancy should be recorded and reported by the investigator to the Novartis CMO & PS Department. Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should includ e an assessment of the possible relationship to brolucizumab (inves tigational) and/or aflibercept, with any pregnancy outcome. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported. 10.1.5 Reporting of study treatment errors Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration or monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, subject or consumer (EMA definition). Study treatment errors and uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol will be collected in the dose administration record in the eCRF and in the Dispensing Log at the study site, irrespective of whether or not associated with an AE/SAE and reported to Safet y only if associated with an SAE."

Designated masked investigator staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF). The eCRFs have been built using fully validated secure web- enabled software that conforms to 21 CFR Part 11 requirements. Investigator site staff will not be given access to the EDC system until they have been trained. Automatic validation programs check for data discrepancies in the eCRFs, allow modification and/or verification of the e ntered data b y the investigator staff. The investigator/designee is responsible for assuring that the data (entered into eCRF) is complete, accurate, and that entry and updates are performed in a timel y manner. Theinvestigator must certify that the data e ntered are complete and accurate. After final database lock, the investigator will receive copies of the subject data for archiving at the investigative site."
52,page_52,"Novartis Confidential Page 53 Amended Protocol Version 0 1 Clean Protocol No. CRTH258C2302 eSource eSource is a data collection system allowing electronic capture of source data and study data, as required per protocol. eSource is intended to be used for this study . eSource replaces the need for using an eCRF. If it is not possible to use eSource for source data capture due to exceptional circumstances, data capture and data management will revert to paper and other electronic methods as appropriate. This study will incorporate electronic technology (eSource Direct Data Entry (DDE)) to capture source documents and source data electronically , consistent with final (Center for Drug Evaluatio n and Research (CDER) 2013) FDA guidance regarding electronic source and regulations related to the maintenance of adequate subject case histories (21 CFR 312.62 [b]). All electronic source documentation and data collected in this study will “meet the same fundamental elements of data quality (e.g. attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, and accurate) that are expected of paper records” into a sy stem that is fully validated and conforms to 21 CFR Part 11 requirements. I nvestigator site staff will not be given access to the sy stem(s) until they have been appropriately trained. Study sites using eSource DDE will be supplied with a tablet personal computer to directl y record subject data and clinical observations on electronic forms with a similar look, feel, and behavior to paper forms. The system will permit the collection of both structured and unstructured information including ad -hoc comments, drawings, and relevant clinical notes the investigative site deems important. Information to be original ly captured and reviewed electronically shall include details of the subject visit and the protocol required assessments performed as a part of these visits, medical history, and concomitant medications. Certain data may be captured via other source documentation (such as safety laboratory data report, imaging) and then transcribed, uploaded or transferred into the eSource DDE system. This, and any additional data treated in this manner, will be source data verified by the study field monitor per the monit oring plan and the location of source data (i.e. source, paper or a local electronic system) will be documented prior to study start. The eSource system has the ability to illustrate when a document has been entered from another source. When using an elect ronic source record as the original point of data capture, there is no additional data entry step for the site for data collected directl y into the application. Rather, the electronic source record directly populates the study database. Automatic validation programs check for data discrepancies and, by generating appropriate error messages, allow the data to be confirmed or corrected before transfer of the data to the vendor working on behalf of Novartis. Remote monitoring of the original electronic source records will take place, however on-site monitoring inspections will continue to take place in order to review data entry of source documentation directly captured on paper and transcribed into the system, to ensure protocol adherence, to assess site operational capabilities, and to perform other monitoring activities that cannot be performed remotely .

During the study , Novartis employ s several methods of ensuring protocol and GCP compliance and the quality /integrity of the sites’ data. The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of subje ct records, the accuracy of data capture/data entry , the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each site’s data may be performed by a c entralized Novartis Clinical Research Associates (CRA) organization. Additionally , a central analy tics organization may analyze data & identify risks & trends for site operational parameters, and provide reports to Novartis clinical teams to assist with trial oversight. The investigator must maintain source documents for each subject in the study , consist ing of case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data,retinal images (OCT, CP, FA, wide- field imaging), and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information on eCRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the subject’s file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed b y the subject (a signed cop y is given to the subject). The investigator must give the monitor access to all releva nt source documents to confirm their consistency with the data capture and/or data entry . Novartis monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the eCRFs are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the subjec ts will be disclosed. 12 Data analy sis and statistical methods The database including all Week 52 data will be locked once all subjects have completed the Week 52 visit or terminated the study prior to Week 52. Data for the primary endpoint, change from basel ine in BCVA at Week 24, will be derived from this database. All subjects still in the study beyond Week 52 will continue to receive masked treatment as scheduled through the planned study duration of 76 weeks. The analysis of the data collected after the W eek 52 visit will be performed once all subjects complete the EOS visit or discontinue from the study . Summary statistics will be presented by treatment group unless otherwise specified. For continuous variables, summary statistics will generall y include : n, mean, standard deviation, median, quartiles, minimum, and maximum. For categorical variables, these will generall y include: n, frequency and percentage in each category . Further technical details and discussions of the statistical considerations will be provided in the SAP. Additional analyses may also be conducted to evaluate the impact of theCOVID -19 pandemic.

The Randomized Analy sis Set (RAS) consists of all enrolled subjects who are randomized in IRT. Subjects are considered randomized when they have been deemed eligible for randomization by the investigator and given a randomization number. Subjects will be analy zed according to the treatment assigned to them at randomization. The Full Anal ysis Set (FAS) comprises all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 IVT injection of the study treatment. Subjects in the FAS will be analy zed according to the treatment assigned to them at randomization. The Safet y Anal ysis Set (SAF) includes all subjects who receive at least 1 IVT injection of the study treatment. Subjects in the Safet y Set will be analyzed according to the study treatment from which they received the majority of treatments up to and including Week 52. The Per Protocol Set (PPS) is a subset of the FAS and will exclude or censor data from subjects with protocol deviations (PDs) and analysis restrictions (ARs) that are expected to majorl y affect the validity of the assessment of efficacy at Week 24 and/or Week 52 including, for e.g. lack of compliance (including missed treatments and treatment misallocation), missing data, prohibited concomitant medication, and deviations from inclusion/exclusion criteria. Confounded data or discontinuation from study treatment due to lack of efficacy and/or safet y do not constitute, in itself, a reason for exclusion from the PPS. Before the Week 52 database lock the relevant protocol deviations and analy sis restrictions will be identified at the subject level in the database. Censoring applied in relation to the specific PDs/ARs will be specified as wel l. The FAS will be the analy sis set for the primary estimand as defined in Table 12 -1. However, when assessing the robustness of the overall efficacy conclusions, considerations will be given to the analysis based on the primary estimand using FAS and the supplementary estimand (refer toTable 12- 1)using PPS, i.e.similar conclusions on non- inferiority based onboth estimands are expected .Inconsistencies in the results will be examined and discussed in the Clinical Study Report . 12.2 Subject demographics and other baseline characteristics Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized with descriptive statistics for the FAS b y treatment group and overall. Summary statistics for other anal ysis sets will only be generated if these are anticipated to be different given the subset of the subjects included in the particular analysis set. Relevant medical history and current medical cond itions will be tabulated by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term of the MedDRA dictionary for the FAS. Other relevant baseline information will be listed and summarized with descriptive statistics as appropriate. 12.3 Treatments Study treatment"

For the SAF, the summary will include exposure data up to Week 52/Week 72. Prior medi cation and concomitant therapies The number and percentage of subjects taking prior medication (an y medication taken up to 90 days prior to screening) or concomitant therapies willbe summarized by preferred term according to the WHO Drug Reference List dictionary using the SAF and FAS (in case there are differences between the two populations). The concomitant therapies (medications and procedures) will include all therapies received after start of study treatment, including those alread y started prior to the start of stud y treatment. Further details will be provided in the SAP. 12.4 Analysis of the primary endpoint(s) 12.4.1 Definition of primary endpoint(s) The primary endpoint is the change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24. BCVA will be assessed by the masked investigator using ETDRS -like charts at an initial distance of 4 meters. The primary anal ysis of the primary endpoint will be based on the FAS. 12.4.2 Statistical model, hypothesis, and method of analy sis The objective related to the primary endpoint is to demonstrate non -inferiority of brolucizumab versus aflibercept with respect to change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24, assuming a non - inferiority margin of 4 ETDRS letters. Let: B = Brolucizumab 6 mg -6 x q4w loading A = Aflibercept 2 mg -6 x q4w loading Consider the following non-inferiorit y hypotheses related to a non-inferiority margin of 4 letters: H0: μB– μA≤ -4 letters versus H A: μB– μ A> -4 letters where μ Band μ Aare the corresponding unknown true mean changes from baseline in BCVA at Week 24 in the brolucizumab and aflibercept arms, respectivel y. The primary estimand associated with the above hypothesis is defined as the between -treatment difference in change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24, excluding the effect of relevant CRVO prohibited/alternative medication(s) applied to the study eye (e.g. alternative anti-VEGF treatments for CRVO, laser, intraocular corticosteroids, among others as further detailed in Section 6.2.2 and in the SAP). The anal ysis set for the primary estimand will be the FAS. Based on the FAS, the above hypotheses will be tested via an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. The model will include treatment, baseline BCVA ( ≤ 34, 34 - 55, ≥ 55 letters) and age"

Additional factors, e.g. ethnicit y, may also be included as appropriate, as well as interactions between treatment and factors of interest. The two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the least square mean difference (brolucizumab -aflibercept) at Week 24 will be presented. Non-inferiorit y will be considered established if the lower limit of the corresponding 95% CI is greater than -4 letters. The same approach for non - inferiority assessment in change from baseline in BCVA at Week 24 will be applied to any supplemen tary estimand. The primary estimand and supplementary estimand of interest are noted in Table 12-1 below together with their key attributes. Sensitivity to the primary estimand will only be explored if the proportion of subjects with missing or censored data is deemed large enough so as to potentially impact the results from the analyses. The estimands outlined below will be discussed in further detail in the SAP.

For subjects with no post - baseline BCVA value, the baseline value will be carried forward. Data collected after the start of alternative CRVO treatments in the study eye (e.g. other anti -VEGF treatment, certain laser procedures or intraocular corticosteroids; further details will be discussed in the SAP) will be censored. The LOCF approach is expected to be sensitive to an early study treatment termination/study termination due to lack of efficacy , assuming that such lack of efficacy is reflected in the last observed BCVA measurement. In case of the use of alternative treatment for the underly ing disease as described above (CRVO), data collected after the start of such a trea tment would be censored. LOCF will then be based on the last value prior to the start of this treatment, again expecting that this value would reflect the negative BCVA outcome under study treatment. In case of missing data due to lack of safety /tolerabili ty with impairment of the function of the study eye, the LOCF method would also provide a sensitive approach to capture such an unfavorable outcome. In case of an earl y stud y termination during the loading phase, the LOCF method will result in a conservati ve estimate, potentially underestimating the true outcome. LOCF is an established method within the assessment of efficacy of anti-VEGF treatments in terms of BCVA outcome. It is important to note that, in order to facilitate a meaningful treatment effect assessment, non-inferiorit y studies should follow the main design features (primary variables, the dose of the active comparator, eligibility criteria, etc.) as the previously conducted superiority trials in which the active comparator demonstrated clinica lly relevant"

This describes different approaches to deal with intercurrent events such as intake of CRVO prohibited/alternative medication in the study eye, or any event leading to exclusion from the PPS, and the resulting missing/censored data. The same approaches to deal with intercurrent events and/or missing data may be applied to some or all of the secondary endpoints as appropriate. For the primary and relevant secondary endpoints, descriptive analyses based on observed data onl y (with and without censoring of data collected after use of relevant prohibited/alterna tive medication for CRVO as described in Section 6.2.2 and further detailed in the SAP) may also be produced.
