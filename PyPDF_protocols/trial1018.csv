Target Population The subject population consists of adult subjects with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus under insulin therapy (pump or multiple - daily injections) Number of Subjects 324 subjects : 159 in cohort 1 165 in cohort 2 Number of Sites 20 sites Study Design: This is a two cohort randomized (2:1), prospective, national multi - center study, enrolling approximately 324 adult subjects with diabetes mellitus at up to 20 sites (between 48 and 100 subjects in each arm). The subjects will have o ne sensor inserted in the upper arm by a trained clinician (investigator). The system will provide real -time glucose information, as well as alarms and alerts during the study period. After 180 days of wear or when the sensor has reached end of life, the s ensor will be removed. Study Duration: 6 months follow -up Study Visits - Visit 1 Screening Visit. Following informed consent process, screening evaluation will determine subject eligibility for enrollment. Visit includes screening of medical and diabetes history, examination and HbA1c assessment. For DT1, the mean time in hypoglycemia in the last 28 days will be recorded from the patient glucose meter (Continuous or Flash meter). Once eligible for one of the two cohorts subjects will complete patient reported outcome measures questionnaire s - Visit 2 Sensor Insertion Visit – (Day 0) . The Sensor is inserted by the Investigator in the upper arm of the subject’s choice. All subjects will use the blinded system where they are required to wear the transmitter over the sensor and interstitial glucose levels are recorded. During this per iod the subjects do not have"

However, patients will enter glucose values for calibration on a special application. Patient will have to install the application on a compatible device with iOS or Android that is wireless and Bluetooth enabled. If there is any kind of problem with the patient mobile device (which was supposed to be compatible) that might interfere with the use of the app, a new mobile device will be lent to the patient. A mobile device (iPod) will be lent t o the patient if his mobile device is not compatible with the mobile application . In both case the patient will have to give it back at the end of the study Between visit 2 and 3 a phone call will be scheduled to ensure a good healing after the insertio n. - Visit 3 30-Day Visit (Day 30 -2/+7 Days). Transmitter and CGM data if any data are downloaded. Sensor insertion site is assessed. Subjects are randomized to either the ‘enabled’ or the control arm of the study. Subjects in the enabled arm will chang e from blind to enabled Eversense CGM system and install a new unblinded application. A specific training on how to use the system, will be made to the ‘enabled’ group. Control subjects will continue to use the blinded CGM system and receive instructions on proper use of a blood glucose meter. - Visit 4 60-Day Visit (Day 60 -3/+7 Days) Transmitter and/or meter data is downloaded. Incision sites are inspected. Patients will complete a survey on treatment and CGM satisfaction. Patients in the control group will be informed in case of unexpected and unacceptable glycemic deterioration ( recorded sensor data indicates periods of the day with recurrent time in hypo glycemia (<54 mg/dL ) and/or in hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL )). - Visit 5 120-Day Visit (Day 120 -3/+7 Days) Transmitter and/or meter data is downloaded. HbA1c will be assessed. Subjects in the control arm of cohort 2 will change from blinded to enabled Eversense CGM system. Those patient s will be instructed on use of the feat ures including the mobile medical application.

19,page_19,"Protocol_ V5 signed, 11 December 2018 Page 19 of 75 Internal 1 Introduction 1.1 Introduction and Background In spite of recent improvement in therapies, diabetes mellitus continues to be a difficult medical condition to treat. The challenge remains to achieve desired glycemic control and to prevent both the short -term consequences (severe hypoglycaemia and DKA) and long-term complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy and cardiovascular problems). The monitoring of blood glucose by the patient with diabetes is one of the key tools of diabetes self-care. The current standard glucose monitoring regimen for patients with insulin -treated diabetes includes using a small portable meter to obtain a capillary fingertip glucose measurement multiple times a day. According to the International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD), “successful application of intensified diabetes management with multiple -daily injection therapy or insulin infusion therapy requires frequent self- monitoring of blood glucose (four to six times a day) and regular, frequent review of the results to identify patterns requiring adjustment to the diabetes treatment plan.1 Despite this monitoring and therapeutic interventions, glucose values may fluctuate widely throughout the day due to the nature of diabetes . In addition, as the BG meter value shows only a point in time glucose level, even patients who monitor frequently may miss significant hypoglycaemic and hyperglycaemic excursions. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), measuring interstitial glucose levels has been developed recently and has been shown to be associated with improved glycemic control in adults with insulin -treated Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. Current commercially available CGM devices require the repeated, frequent insertion of a sensor by the patient. Senseonics, Inc. a medical device manufacturer headquartered in Germantown, Maryland, USA, is developing a new CGM System intended for measuring interstitial fluid glucose levels in adults with diabetes mellitus. The Senseonics CGM System measures interstitial fluid glucose levels continuously and is implanted under the skin by a trained clinician. Unlike commercially available transcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring devices with short operating lives (up to 7 days), the Senseonics Sensor is intended to be inserted subcutaneously with no sensor part protruding from the skin, and the operating life is intended to be up to 150 days or until the end of life indicator is reached (180 days) . Roche Diabetes Care France SAS is the EU distributor of this product and sponsor of this study. 1.2 Intended Use of Study Device The study investigational Device is the Senseonics Eversense CGM System XL (“System”). The Senseonics Eversense Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is a glucose monitoring device intended to continually measure interstitial fluid glucose levels in individuals with diabetes for the operating life of the sensor. The Senseonics Continuous Glucose Monitoring System is intended to be used:"

The purpose of this new clinical investigation is to evaluate the usefulness of using a long term implantable continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor to improve glycemic control in patients with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus under insulin therapy. This study will be conducted in France. Data from this clinical trial will be used to support reimbursement dossier that will be submitted to French Health authori ties. This will be the first study to provide evidences of the potential c linical benefits of the Eversens e XL system. Those potential clinical benefits can be translated by a reduction of HbA1c and a decrease of time spend in hypoglycaemia. Regarding HbA 1c, any reduction in HbA1c is likely to reduce the risk of complications either in type1 or type 2 d iabetics patient as reported by Stratton in 2000 and Bebu in 2017 . Regarding hypoglycaemia, Hypoglycaemia often causes recurrent physical morbidity, recurre nt or persistent psychosocial morbidity, or both and sometimes causes death (Cryer, 2003) . Even patient under intensive therapy with a low HbA1c are facing severe hypoglycaemia events. Data coming from the DCCT study are supporting this, they have been published by Gubitosi -Klug et al in 2017 . With the implantable glucose sensor, hypoglycaemia ev ents, especially d uring night could be limited. Threshold for hypoglycaemia have been based on last ADA recommendations published in Standa rds of Medical Care in Diabetes -2017 : Level Glycemic criteria Description Glucose alert value (level 1) ≤70 mg/ dL Sufﬁciently low for treatment with fast -acting carbohydrate and dose adjustment of glucose -lowering therapy Clinically signiﬁcant hypoglycaemia (level 2) ≤54 mg/dL Sufﬁciently low to indicate serious, clinically important hypoglycaemia Severe hypoglyc aemia (level 3) No speciﬁc glucose threshold Hypoglycaemia associated with severe cognitive impairment requiring external assistance for recovery Table 1 Classification of Hypoglycemia"

23,page_23,"Protocol_ V5 signed, 11 December 2018 Page 23 of 75 Internal Patients with insulin treated diabetes are invited to participate in the study either because they have an HbA1c level > 8.0% (cohort 1) or because they have T1D and spend more than 1 .5 hour with FGM <70 mg/dl per day as a mean for at least 28 days (cohort 2). The investigator will inform the patient about the study and review the list of inclusion and exclusion criteria. If they agree to participate, patients will sign a consent form and they will come for a second visit (no more than 15 days later) during which the sensor will be inserted subcutaneously. After the insertion, all study subjects will wear the blinded transmitter over the sensor continuously except for charging and will be blinded to any glucose values. However, patients will enter glucose v alues for calibration on a special application . Participants will continue their usual glucose monitoring. After 30 days, they will come for a third visit. In cohort 1, they will be randomized in the ‘enabled’ or control group. In the ‘enabled’ group they will be trained to use the system. They will not be allowed to use another CGM or FGM. In the control group they will continue with their usual glucose monitoring system (SBMG or FGM) with the CGM in blinded mode. In cohort 2, if they still comply with the inclusion criteria “time in hypo” based on FGM results, they will be randomized in the ‘enabled’ or control group. In the ‘enabled’ group they will be trained to use the system. They will not be allowed to use another CGM or FGM. In the control group t hey will continue with their usual glucose monitoring system (SBMG or FGM) with the CGM in blinded mode. If they no longer comply with the inclusion criteria , they will have the opportunity to start using the system, but in an open phase, the investigator will determine the planning of visits as per their usual follow -up, no data will be collected except the report of any adverse event. They will come at the cent re to remove the sensor at the end of the sensor life ( 180). A follow -up visit will be performed at day 60 and day 120 for control and enabled patients. At Day 120, participants in the control group of the cohort 2 will have the opportunity to have the system enabled until it reach the end of the sensor life or have the sensor removed and ex it the study. Patients in the control group of the cohort 1 will be informed in case of unexpected and unacceptable glycemic deterioration ( recorded sensor data indicates periods of the day with recurrent time in hypo glycemia (<54 mg/dL ) and/or in hypergl ycemia (>250 mg/dL )). After 180, these participants will have the opportunity to have the system enabled for 6 months after study end or hav e the sensor removed, exit the study and receiv e gift vouchers In case of incidents with the enabled system, the report will be made through the regular materiovigilance. A last follow -up visit by phone call will be performed to evaluate the incision site for healing. 2.2 Rationale for the Study Design Two separate cohor ts have been created in this study to be able to support different potential clinical benefits: 1. HbA1c reduction will be the primary objective for patient having a n HbA1c level > 8% that can translate a non -well controlled disease. 2. The time spent per day b elow 54mg/dL will be the primary objective for patient spending more than 1 .5 hour per day with sensor glucose < 70 mg/dL)."

XL Glucose Sensor, (approximately 3.3 mm [0.130”] diameter x 15.7 mm [0.620”] length) which has a ring that elutes the steroid dexamethasone 2. Battery -powered external Transmitter (“Smart Transmitter”) 3. Mobile Medical Application (MMA) for display of glucose information that runs on a Handheld Device (HHD). Sensor Transmitter Mobile Medical Application Figure 2 : Eversen se System Accessories to the system include: 1. Eversen se DMS Application 2. Eversense Insertion tools kit (Blunt dissector for creating a pocket under the skin and Insertion tool used to place the Sensor into the pocket.) 3. Transmitter accessories (power supply, adhesive patches) The manufacturer of the product is : Senseonics, Incorporated 20451 Seneca Meadows Parkway Germantown, MD 20876 -7005 USA Description The Senseonics CGM Sensor uses a selective, fully reversible binding between glucose and a unique fluorescent indicator macromolecule that is grafted on the surface of the Sensor. The fundamental recognition reaction is a reversible condensation of the cis-diol groups of glucose with the bis -boronate moiety of an indicator. Glucose binding by the indicator macromolecule results in an increase in fluorescence intensity. Glucose signal transduction is accomplished by measuring the fluorescence intensity modulation using the Sensor’s optical system."
26,page_26,"Protocol_ V5 signed, 11 December 2018 Page 26 of 75 Internal The Senseonics System Transmitter powers the Sensor and receives signals from the Sensor across the skin. The Sensor does not contain a battery or other stored power source; instead it is powered discretely, as needed, by a simple inductive magnetic link between the Transmitter and Sensor. Signals carrying glucose concentration data are superimposed upon the magnetic power link between the two components. This results in “passive” telemetry, rather than an “active” radio frequency (RF) transmission, between the Sensor and Transmitter. Between readings, the Sensor remains electrically dormant and fully powered down. At each query (automatically set for approximately every five minutes, with a duration of approximately 100 milliseconds), the Transmitter sends power (via magnetic link) to activate the sensor, and then uses this same magnetic link to capture the reading. Finally, the Transmitter calculates and stores the measured glucose value for transmission to the Mobile Medical Application. Components of the Senseonics CGM System are traced by serial number and/or lot number. The Sensor, Sensor holder, insertion tool, and blunt dissector are provided sterile. Sterilized components also have an expiration date. The device is labeled in compliance with regulatory language requirements identifying it as investigational. The Instructions for Use are provided with each shipment. Insertion of the Sensor is a minimally invasive procedure and clinical investigators representing the intended use population (Endocrinologists, Internists) will be appropriately trained in the procedure prior to insertion or removal of the Sensor. The procedure is described below (Figure 2): A / B/ Figure 3: Procedure to insert (A/) and remove (B/) the sensor Transmitters will be provided for single -subject use in this clinical trial."

At study end (D18 0 maximum), all sensors still in function will be removed. 3.2 Consumables of Eversense XL A new adhesive patch to maintain the transmitter on the skin is needed each t ime the transmitter is placed on the skin (at minimum after each recharge of the battery) . 3.3 Comparator Device Glucose monitoring is a fundamental requisite for insulin therapy in patients with diabetes. In addition to the routine self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), several products from different brands are available on the French market. The continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in the subcutaneous interstitial fluid is also possible . CGM systems can overcome limitations of the SMBG, which pr ovides incomplete glucose profiles and often underestimate nocturnal hypoglycaemia and post -prandial hyperglycaemia. As of today in France no CGM is available for diabetics patient, only one flash glucose monitoring (FGM) system FreeStyle® Libre™ (FSL) is reimbursed. Differently from C GM systems, the FGM system provides actual interstitial glucose concentration on demand, i.e., when patients perform a sensor scan, and has no direct alarms . In our study either SBMG from different brands or FGM (FSL) are cons idered as comparators. 3.4 Status of Documentation of Study Device (s) Eversen se system is composed of several devices , the Transmitter and the sensor is an active implantable medical device .

Subjects should complete in a quiet undisturbed place using a computer or tablet PC (e.g. iPad ). The questionnaire will be part of the eCRF. Visit 1 Visit 4 Visit 6 CGM SAT X (enabled) X (enabled) DTSQs X X X DTSQc X ADDQoL X X DDS X X X HFS X X X Partner -DDS X X X • Satisfaction with CGM (CGM -Sat) 44 item scale assessing experiences with CGM over previous 6 months. The scale is designed to measure the impact of CGM on Diabetes management and family relationships, plus on satisfaction with emotional, behavioral and cognitive effects of CGM use. Res ponses are rated on a 5 -point scale from ‘strongly disagree’ to ‘strongly agree’. The validation of this questionnaire used in this study are reported by Tubiana -Rufi (2010). • The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire Like the DTSQs (original status ), the DTSQc (change version) contains eight items scored on 7-point scales. Six items (Qs.1 and 4 –8) measure Treatment Satisfaction (dealing with: satisfaction with current treatment; convenience of the treatment; flexibility; satisfaction with own unders tanding of their diabetes; how likely to recommend their present treatment; and how satisfied to continue with their present treatment). These are summed to produce a total Treatment Satisfaction score. Questions 2/3, concerning Perceived Frequency of Hype rglycaemia ('Perceived Hyperglycaemia')/Perceived Frequency of Hypoglycaemia ('Perceived Hypoglycaemia') respectively, are treated separately from the satisfaction items and from each other . DTSQs is completed at baseline, visit 4 and at final visit wherea s DTSQc is completed only at final visit. The reliability and factor structure of the eight language versions used in this study are reported by Plowright (2000). • The Audit of Diabetes -Dependent Quality of Life The ADDQoL measures the impact of diabetes an d its treatment on 19 specific aspects of life. The ADDQoL has been designed to perm it users to indicate whether potentially affected domains of life apply to them and to rate the impact of their diabetes on all applicable aspects of life, together with th e perceived importance of each domain for their QoL. The scales range from −3 to +1 for 19 life domains (impact rating) and from 0 to +3 in attributed importance (importance rating). A weighted score for each domain is calculated as a multiplier of impact rating and importance rating (ranging from −9 to +3)."
44,page_44,"Protocol_ V5 signed, 11 December 2018 Page 44 of 75 Internal The validity and reliability of the 19 -item ADDQoL are reported by Wee (2006). • Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS) Screening scale The DDS2 is a 2 -item diabetes distress screening instrument asking responde nts to rate on a 6 -point scale the degree to which the following items caused distress: (1) feeling overwhelmed by the demands of living with diabetes, and (2) feeling that I am often failing with my diabetes regimen . Its validation has been published by F ischer (2008). • Hypoglycemia Fear Survey part (HFS) II – worry subscale HFS II - worry items describe specific concerns that patients may have about their hypoglycemic episodes (e.g., being alone, episodes occurring during sleep, or having an accident). The scale range from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). The validity and reliability of the scale are reported by Gonder -Frederick (2011 ) 8.2 Additional Questionnaires • Partner Diabetes Distress Scale (Partner -DDS) The Partner -DDS is a 21 -item self -report scale that highlights four critical dimensions of partner -related distress: “my partner’s diabetes management”, “how best to help”, “diabetes and me”, and hypoglycemia. The scales range from 0 (not at all) to 4 (a great deal). The validity and reliability of the scale are reported by Polonsky (2016) • Free text questionnaire for ‘enabled’ patients This questionnaire contains six questions that have the aim to record the opinion of the patient about the ‘enabled’ system at the end of the study. .

Risk analysis and control has been performed as prescribed in relevant provisions of IEC 62304, ISO 14971, a nd IEC 60601 -1, in accordance with the requirements of ISO 13485. Residual risks associated with the device included selected risks in the categories of electromagnetic and thermal energy, biocompatibility, biologic, chemical and mechanical factors and use r error. All identified risks have been mitigated to an “As far as Possible” (ALARP) level of risk by various methods including software revision and re -validation, hardware design modification, packaging and sterilization process validation and labeling revision. The residual risks were determined to be acceptable for conduct of this clinical investigation. 10.1 Potential Risks The Senseonics CGM System is approved for CE mark for adjunctive use in managing glucose values in patients with diabetes. Subjects wi ll be instructed not to use the occurrence of glucose alarms/alerts or displayed sensor glucose values to make treatment decisions, but to use values obtained from the SMBG meter. The following are potential risks related to use of the device. During part icipation in this clinical study , subject s may encounter the following known potential risks of the Eversense system : Likely: • Excessive bleeding during insertion or removal • Bruising or swelling • Hematoma formation • Puritis (itching of the incision while healing) Less Likely: • Skin irritation and/or redness • Discoloration of skin • Device migration • Device malfunctions of the sensor and/or transmitter with possible need to remove and/or replace the Sensor and/or transmitter • Burning sensation or pain. • Elevated blood pressure • Water retention in the tissue, swelling or edema • Confusion • Disorientation • Increased or decreased sensitivity to touch or pain • Metallic taste • Sleepiness • Visual disturbances and/or blurred vision"

49,page_49,"Protocol_ V5 signed, 11 December 2018 Page 49 of 75 Internal This clinical investigation involves subjects with diabetes mellitus. These subjects may experience hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia as a consequence of their existing condition and medical management (e.g. insulin administration). For this study, hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia will not be reported as adverse events unless meeting criteria of a Serious Adverse Event. Should a known side effect(s) occur to administered medication(s) used in the intervention, such effects will be reported as part of the adverse event description and will not be considered a separate adverse event. Subject may have an X-ray or ultrasound of the sensor site. X-rays may cause damage to cells in the body, which in turn may increase the risk of developing cancer. This increase in risk associated with each X-ray procedure is extremely low but does slowly increase with the increasing number of X- rays tests you have. Subjects must not undergo MRI while the Sensor is inserted or the Transmitter is in place. Both are incompatible with MRI procedures. Serious injury such as internal tissue burn (from the Sensor overheating) or topical skin burn (from the Transmitter overheating) may occur during an MRI and subsequent localized infection may develop as a result of the Sensor overheating. If an MRI is required for subject care, the Sensor should be removed and the Subject will be withdrawn from the study, according to study stopping rules. In the event of a situation where MRI is required and it is not possible to remove the Sensor, the medical staff must contact the Sponsor. 10.2 Minimization of Risks The Sponsor has minimized the potential of the above risks to occur by: • Selection of qualified Investigators consulting study subject s during the scheduled visits including an inspection of insertion site during each in -clinic visit and document any suspected adverse event. Subjects will be instructed to contact the investigator immediately upon any sign of significant irritation or discomfort or evidence of infection as described previously. • Subject s are advised not to change their current diabetes therapy without consulting their physician (Investigat or). • Investigators will be trained in the technique for Sensor insertion and removal. 10.3 Potential Benefits The study subject s may experience the following potential benefits while participating in this study: • Study devices (acc. to randomization) will be pro vided at no charge to subject s. • Subject s may be motivated to learn more about diabetes and to have better discussions of potential issues with their health care providers. • Subject s may gain personal satisfaction f rom participating in this study but also im prove their quality of life by having a better and easier glucose monitoring system (less frequent SBMG), system can be removed from the skin, they can be reassured by knowing they will be alerted by alarms in case of hypo or hyperglycemia …) Subjects may reduce"

In addition , this definition includes events related to the procedures involved. For users or other persons , this definition is restricted to events related to investigational m edical devices. 11.1.2 Serious Adverse Event A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any AE that fulfils at least one of the following criteria: • Led to death. • Led to a serious deterioration in the health of a subject resulting in: - A life -threatening illness or injury , or - A permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function , or - An in -patient or prolonged hospitalization , or - A medical or surgical intervention to prevent life -threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function. • Foetal distress , foetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect. A planned hospitalization for a pre -existing condition , or a procedure required by the study procedure , without serious deterioration in health , is not considered an SAE. 11.2 Definition of Hypoglycemia , Hyperglycemia Episodes and Diabetic Ketoacidosis Hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia can be symptomatic or asymptomatic and are subset of AEs occurring within Diabetes studies. Any hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia episode which occurs during the course of the study will be documented by the subject him-/herself in his/her individual Subject Diary , if applicable, or will be defined specifically by the study procedure e.g. in the visit description of this study proto col. 11.2.1 Hypoglycemia Episode An asymptomatic or symptomatic hypoglycemic episode is defined as a low blood glucose reading below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) without external intervention is considered as a non - captured expected AE described in Section 11.3.1.2 ."

It usually requires needing assistance that can require in addition medical attention (emergency room, hospitalization). Such episodes are defined as SAEs and, thus, they must follow the SAE reporting pathway via the eCRF (or mailed / faxed). 11.2.3 Hyperglycemia Episode Hyperglycemia is defined as high blood glucose readings , a recommended threshold to intervene could be defined as values above 2 50 mg/dL (13. 9 mmol/L) . However, i nvestigators should consider the condition of the individual subject . Only hyperglycemia episodes in combin ation with medical intervention or additional diagnostic procedures have to be documented as AE s or SAEs in the eCRF , as described in Section 11.3.1.1 . 11.2.4 Diabetic Ket oacidosis Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a rare yet potentially fatal potentially life -threatening complication that can occur in patients with both type1 and 2 Diabetes mellitus. DKA results from a shortage of insulin; in response the body switches to bur ning fatty acids and producing acidic ketone bodies that cause most of the symptoms and complications. It is a medical emergency requiring hospitalization to the emergency room for the majority of patients. Symptoms are polydipsia, polyphagia, polyuria, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, but also deep gasping breathing, confusion and occasionally coma are typical symptoms. Diabetic ketoacidosis is diagnosed when the combination of hyperglycemia (high blood sugar s (>250 mg/dL, typically 350 –800 mg/dL), profuse glycosuria (2 –4 mg/min/kg), large amounts of ketones in the blood (β -hydroxybutyrate) or on urinanalysis (acetoacetate) and acidosis demonstrated by arterial blood gas measurement. It is categorized in adult s into one of three stages of severity: • Mild: blood pH decreased to between 7.25 and 7.30 (normal 7.35 –7.45); serum bicarbonate decreased to 15 –18 mmol/l (normal above 20); the person is alert • Moderate: pH 7.00 –7.25, bicarbonate 10 –15, mild drowsiness may be present • Severe: pH below 7.00, bicarbonate below 10, stupor or coma may occur Elements of management include making the appropriate diagnosis using current laboratory tools and clinical criteria and coordinating fluid resuscitation, insulin thera py, and electrolyte"

These captured expected AEs will be handled as follows: Subject s will be instructed to follow their personal physicians’ instructions for management of low and high blood glucose values or otherwise as instructed by the Investigator. 11.3.1.2 Non-Captured Expected Adverse Events Non-Captured expected AEs may occur at any time in the normal course of managing diabetes. For the purpose of this study , they will be considered as non-captured expected AEs and will not be documented in the eCRF , these include: • Asymptomatic or symptomatic hypo glycemia episode without external intervention (see Section 11.2.1 ). • Hyper glycemia without medical intervention. • In the event of a sore finger , subject s will be advised to avoid taking self -monitoring blood glucose samples from that finger. • In the event of a mild infection at a lancing site , the study subject will be reminded to wash hands before all blood tests and encouraged to consult their nurse or physician on the management of an infection. Since these non-captured expected Adverse Events identified ab ove are common as well as expected and pose minimal immediate risk to the subject s, they will not be tracked and logged as AEs during the course of the study. Investigators may log reports of these non-captured expected AEs as is cu stomary within their practice.

In order to match all of possible regulations and fulfill all of the responsibilities regarding recording and reporting as well as to allow correct handling of different deviations there are three categories of deviations defined: Non Relevant Deviation - Deviation which does not affect the rights, safety or well -being of the subject or the scientific integrity of the clinical investigation. Relevant Deviation – Deviation which may affect the rights, safety or well -being of the subject or the scientific integrity of the clinical investigation. Serious Deviation - Deviation affects subject's rights, safety and wellbeing, or the scientific integrity of the clinical investigation. Deviation must be reported to the Sponsor, who is responsible to report accor ding to national regulations. Protocol Deviations may be recorded in the eCRF throughout the study, and documented further via a specific form or the query -system, as applicable. The Investigator must notify the Sponsor of any serious deviation to protec t the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency as soon as possible/promptly after the emergency occurred.

61,page_61,"Protocol_ V5 signed, 11 December 2018 Page 61 of 75 Internal 14 Statistical Considerations and Data Analysis A Statistical Analysis Plan will be established, validated by the Scientific Committee of the study, detailing the statistical analysis. The statistical analysi s will be performed on SAS/WINDOWS XP version 9.4 or later. The analysis will be carried separately for each cohort. The type I error (alpha) is set at 0.05 two-sided for each analysis. No adjustment of the alpha risk is planned because these two analyse s have a distinct primary objective and criteria. 14.1 Null Hypothesis and Sample Size Calculation Cohort 1 The primary criterion is the HbA1c (%) at D1 80 visit. The calculation is based on a comparison between enabled and control groups. The randomization ratio is 2:1 (2 patients enabled: 1 patient control). Given the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study, the following assumptions were made: - Standard deviation: 1% - Minimum expected absolute effect: 0.5% - Power : 80% - Type I error : 5% With these assumptions, 144 subjects are needed for the analysis of this cohort (96 patients in the enabled arm and 48 patients in the control arm). Since a maximum of 10% of non -evaluable patients is expected, the number of subjects to be randomized is 159. Cohort 2 The primary criterion is the percentage of time spent in hypoglycemia < 54 mg/dl between D90 visit and D1 20 visit (using CGM system data). The calculation is based on a comparison between enabled and control groups. The randomization ratio is 2:1 (2 patients enabled: 1 patient control). Given the inclusion and exclusion criteria for this study and the results of the IMPACT study, the following assumptions were made for the sample size calculation: - % of time spent in hypoglycemia < 54 mg/dl: 6.62 5% - Pooled standard deviation at the end of the study of 5.75% (using Cohen method : Cohen, J. (1988), Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, 2nd Edition. Hillsdale: Lawrence Erlbaum. Hedges L. V., Olkin I. (1985). Statistical methods for meta -analysis.

Since a maximum of 10% of non -evaluable patients is expected, the number of subjects to be randomized is 165 (110 patients enabled and 55 patients control). 14.2 Populations for Analysis o Full Analysis Set (FAS) Population: The FAS population will consist of all randomized patients with the sensors inserted at Visit 2 and with at least one CGM data available from randomization visit to D1 80 visit. This is the primary population for the analysis of efficacy. o Per -Protocol (PP) population: The Per -Protocol population consists of all FAS patients without major protocol deviation, defined blindly by the scientific committee during the data review before the data base lock. This is the secondary population for the analysis of effica cy. o Safety Population: The Safety population will consist of all patients with the sensors inserted at Visit 2. This is the primary population for the analysis of safety. 14.3 Subject Demographics and Baseline Characteristics The following demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by study group: • Gender , age. • Height , weight , body mass index . • Diabetes Background and History • Diabetes Family History • Diabetes M edication . • Baseline HbA1c. • Medical history - diseases other than Diabetes • Previous Medications for diseases other than Diabetes All subject characteristic variables will be summarized descriptively. For continuous data: number of missing data, number of data analyzed, mean, standard deviation, Q1, Q3, minimum, maximum and median and 95% confidence interval. For categorical data: number of missing data, frequencies and percentages of each modality, and 95% confidence intervals using binomial law. The percentage of subjects will be calculated once missing data are excluded from the denomin ator. 14.4 Primary Objective Analysis Cohort 1 The primary criterion is the HbA1c (%) at D180 visit. The comparison between both groups will be carried out using a covariance analysis model adjust ed on the site factor and the level of HbA1c at baseline and including stratification"
63,page_63,"Protocol_ V5 signed, 11 December 2018 Page 63 of 75 Internal variables. In case of non -normal distribution, a study will be done in order to use non -parametric tests. A non -parametric approach will be performed. Cohort 2 The primary criterion is the percen tage of time in hypoglycemia <54 mg/dl between D90 visit and D120 visit. The comparison between both groups will be carried out using a covariance analysis model adjusted on the level of hypoglycemia at baseline (time in hypoglycemia <54 mg/dl between D0 visit and D30 visit) and including stratification variables. In case of non -normal distribution, a study will be done in order to use either a model based on Poisson distribution or a non - parametric test approach. 14.5 Secondary Objective(s) Analysis 14.5.1 Definition of secondary criteria 1.

Continuous criteria will be compared between both groups using the same analysis model as planned for the primary criterion (analysis of covariance model). Categorical criteria will be compared between both groups using a logistic regression model including baseline value if available and stratification variables. 14.6 Safety Analysis A descriptive analysis of the safety criteria will be performed for each cohort. Adverse Events All AEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Only AEs occurring after the start of the sensor insertion after Visit 2 will be included in the AEs tables. Summaries of incidence rates (frequencies and percentages) of individual AEs by MedDRA System Organ Class and Preferred Term will be prepared. Such summaries will be displayed for all AEs, AEs by maximum severity, AEs by strongest causality to study device and AEs leading to withdrawal of study device. Deaths, other SAEs and AEs leading to withdrawal will be listed separately. In addition, the sub -group of ADEs and SADEs will also be summarized by MedDRA System Organ Class and Preferred Term inc luding summaries by study device. Moreover, incidence rates of specific types of error messages (as defined in the SAP) per 100 patient years will be calculated together with exact two -sided 95% CI. Episodes (numbers) of the following AEs will be summarize d: • Symptomatic hypoglycemia • Severe hypoglycemia (SAEs) • Diabetic Ketoacidosis (SAEs) The following ADEs are of particular interest: • ADEs and unanticipated ADEs leading to replacement of device. Incidence rates of all ADEs and of these ADEs and AEs of special interest (as captured on the AE Form in the eCRF) per 100 patient years will be calculated together with exact two -sided 95% CIs assuming that the number of special AEs observed in the study is Poisson distributed. 14.7 Concomitant Medication Previous a nd concomitant medications (separated for Diabetes and for other indications) will be listed by subject ."
