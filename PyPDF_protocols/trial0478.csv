1,page_1,"VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Version 1.0: 04/2018 Page 2 of 55 Abstract Objective: Combining procedural and behavioral treatments may have great potential for achieving large magnitude treatment effects for CLBP in Veterans. Th is is a pilot clinical trial to evaluate the effects of treatment combinations among Veterans with chronic lower back pain (CLBP) with four possible treatment arms: lumbar medial branch nerve radiofrequency ablation (LRFA), targeted steroid injections to the facet nerves with simulated LRFA, video telehealth tablet - and PC -based Activity Tracker -Informed Video -Enabled Cognitive Behavio ral Therapy (AcTIVE -CBT), and telephone -based self-directed CBT and education (TBSCE). Research Design and Methodology: The proposed research uses a 2 x 2 factorial randomized control trial (RCT) design to examine the individual and combined effects of LRF A and AcTIVE -CBT. The primary outcome is participant -reported back -related functional limitations (mobility and activities of daily living [ADLs ]) at 3 months, as measured by the Roland - Morris Disability Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include activity t racker-assessed step counts, back pain intensity, reduction in opioid use, and quality of life. The randomized control trial will include up to 30 patients from the VA Puget Sound Health Care System ( VAPSHCS ) Pain Clinic aged 18 and older with a history of CLBP and eligibility for a LRFA procedure, of whom we expect 20 participants will be randomized and complete 3 -month data collection. Appropriate LRFA candidates will be offered to participate according to the same criteria used for determining LRFA eligibility in usual clinical care (including responses to 2 sets of medial branch blocks [ MBBs ]). The provision of LRFA, targeted steroid injections to the facet nerves , AcTIVE -CBT, and TBSCE treatments are not considered to be research, since these treatme nts are usual clinical care or modifications to usual clinical care . All aspects of treatment will involve credentialed providers already working at VAPSHCS. These clinical treatments will be coordinated within the framework of the study procedures and proces ses. Participants will schedule a date for their lumbar procedure (LRFA or targeted steroid injections to the facet nerves with simulated LRFA ). Computer -generated concealed block randomized assignment lists will be created, and baseline study assessments will take place on the day of the lumbar procedure. AcTIVE -CBT and TBSCE treatments will take place over 3 -months post -randomization. Participants would be blinded to whether they are receiving the study ‘interventions’ or ‘controls’, over the first 3 mon ths of follow -up. Follow -up study assessments will happen 1 month, 2 month s, and 3 months post -procedure. The main outcome time point is 3 - month follow -up. After the 3 -month main study period, participants will be offered the option to either be unblinded to their treatment allocations or to remain blinded to their assigned treatments for up to 9 additional months of optional monthly study outcome assessments. Unblinded participants may make subsequent treatment decisions as they wish, so optional assessmen ts after the study period may be affected by unblinding and other changes in treatment and are not truly randomized comparisons. Participants who did not receiv e LRFA during the main 3 -month period of follow -up may elect to pursue LRFA as part of normal cl inical care. Relevance to VA Mission: The potential for learning about effective treatment combinations for CLBP yielded by this research is directly relevant to the clinical care o f Veterans with this condition. These findings may inform clinical care pra ctices, and/or future research to more definitively characterize the specific and combined effects of the treatments studied here.

A major ba rrier to mitigating the impac t of CL BP on the Ve teran population is t he fact that most CLBP treatments have only s mall magnitude effects. In a rev iew commissioned by the Agency for Health Resear ch and Quality (AHRQ), we found improvements in pain of ≤10% f or most first -line rehabilita tive treatme nts for CLBP, such as exerci se therapy (including physical therapy), yoga, and tai chi.6 Improvements i n functional limitations were generally even smaller than improvements in pai n.6 For these reasons, combining pain treatments in future VA research emer ged as a core recommendation in 2016 from a VA State of t he Art conference on non -pharmacologic pain managemen t (SOTA #13) . VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"
7,page_7,"VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Version 1.0: 04/2018 Page 8 of 55 Similar suggest ions were al so made in 2016 by other US agencies including AHRQ,6 the Patie nt- Centered Outcome s Research Institute,28 and joint research initiatives by the National Institut es of Health, VA, and Department of Defense.27 An impo rtant unanswered question is “Which treatments should be combined? ”. In the context of the stepped -care model of pain treatment applied in the VA and many US settings,1,34 it may be impractical or unethical to combi ne first -line CLBP treatments (such as ph ysical therapy) with second -line treatments (such as invasive spine procedures or surgeries), since failu re of first -line treatment is typically a prerequisite fo r invasive second -line CLBP treatments. Another vital consideration is which inter vention comb ination s are most likely to produce larger magnitude treatment effects than that of individual treatments alone. In approaching this question, we applied the theo retical framework of the Nagi disablement model, in w hich back pain is considered an impairmen t on th e pathway to disabili ty (Figure 1). Functional recovery and minimizing disability are the end goal s of rehabilitative care. We reason that combining treatm ents that target distinct points in the disablement p athway are more likely to ach ieve large e ffects on functional recover y, as compared to treatments targeting the same underlying mechanisms (which might lead to redundancy and diminishing returns). Proced ural interventions for CLBP aim primarily to address proximal stages in the disabl ement pathwa y, such as the underlying lu mbar spine pathoanatomy and low back pain. In contrast, behavioral interventi ons for CLBP also target factors over which patients have some control, such as the way patients think about p ain, or how pain affects thei r behavior. By modi fying these things, b ehavioral interventions may affect distal stages in the disablement pathway a nd achieve effects on functional recovery that are not ne cessarily dependent on an improvement in pain. Theref ore, we theorize that a combi nation of pr ocedura l and behavioral trea tments may have the greatest potential for realizing large magnitude treatmen t effects for CLBP in Veterans. Towards this end, this study will use a 2 x 2 factorial randomized controll ed trial (RCT) design to investigate the individ ual and combined effe cts of 1) lumbar medial branch nerve radiofrequency ablation (LRFA), a common ly used procedural intervention to target low back pain s everity, and 2) a telehealth tablet - and personal com puter (PC) -based Activity Tra cker-Informe d Video -Enabled Cognitive Be havioral Therapy program (which we call “AcTIVE -CBT”), a behavioral intervent ion designed primarily to target functional limitations b oth secondary to, and independent of, improvements in pain. AcTIVE -CBT is a modifi cation of st andard CBT delivered by vide o telehealth, which places a greater emphasis on increasing physical activity , and uses current activity tracker technology to support physical activity and an active lifestyle more broad ly. For each of these 2 treat ments, we wi ll comp are outcomes with ano ther standard of care treatment that either poses 1) less risk, or 2) less inconvenience to the Veteran participant, but with potentia lly comparable or equivalent treatment benefits . The factorial RCT design of this study will i nform a s to whether ‘stackin g’ disparate CLBP treatments can result in greater treatment effects than tha t of each treatment alone.

LRFA is a minimally invasive non -pharmacologic procedure offered a t many VA pain clinics , and it is standard care at th e VAPSHCS Pain Clinic. It can be used in patient s for which CLBP is i solated as coming from the lumbar facet joints, defined by pain relief (‘posi tive responses’) to local anesthetic medial branch blocks (MBB s) along the dorsal ramus medial branch nerves (which we refer to informally here as the ‘facet nerves ’).7,17,22,23,30 Unlike most CLBP treatments, LRFA may result in large -magnitude improvements (≥75% for pain and functional limitations) in properly selected patients.10 However, LFRA is a neu rodestructive procedure involving the temporary destruction of the facet nerves, and there is conflicting evidence regarding its efficacy.2,5,9,11,18,19,21,26,29 -31,33 In particular, i t is un known whether LRFA achieves greate r improvements in function al limitation s when compared to other a ctive pro cedure treatments such as injections targeting the facet joints that do not destroy the facet nerves.17 In this proposed research, outcomes f or participants receiving the LRFA pro cedure will be compared to outcomes for participants receiving a simulated LRFA procedure, in which targeted steroid injections are administered to the involved facet nerves tha t would otherwise have been destroyed (th at is, no nerve destruction is perform ed). Although cognitive -behaviora l therapy (CBT) is an accepted treatment with demonstrated efficacy for CLBP, 3,4 conventional CBT is not wi dely available, particularly in ru ral areas,14 and incurs substant ial travel burdens for Veterans. Our AcTIVE -CBT modification to standard CBT will allow rehabilitation psychologists to deliver CBT directly t o Veter ans in their homes using video -enabled tablets or PCs, facilitating grea ter compliance and access. The AcTI VE-CBT intervention also applies unique approaches to promote sustainable behavior change towards a more active lifestyle, including use of th e Fitbi t activity tracker to provide accu rate, objective feedback on activity l evels and step counts to V eterans a nd providers and inform goal setting and progress. Such an approach may facilitate the improvements in functional limitations and activity that have been elusive in RCTs of procedu ral interventions such as LRFA. An import ant unanswered question is whether still more efficient (i.e. fewer treatments) programs of CBT and more convenient options for CBT (self -paced and self -directed programs) may r esult i n similar improvements, at still g reater efficiency and ease for Vetera n access. In this proposed research, outcomes for participants receiving AcTIVE -CBT will be compared to outcom es for participants receiving ‘telephone -based self -directed CBT and educat ion’ or TBSCE, a brief and efficie nt form of telehealth CBT. The TBSCE t reatment involves a single telephon e-based counseling session between the Veteran participant and a psychologist with a structured 3-month plan of education and lessons pertaini ng to principles of CBT and training to d evelop active habits of CBT guided by printed materials that we will provide. The structured plan is designed to be self -paced and convenient, allowing for some flexibility while covering all the main components of traditi onal CBT. These will be supple ment ed by a supportive contact at the appr oximate midpoint of the 3 -month per iod and ad hoc availability of the psychologist if requested by the participant. The expected age range of study participants is 18 years of age and older. We expect the general heal th status of the subject population to be about average for Vete rans’ age s. Patients with severe and major active medical or psychiatric comorbidities will not be eligible for the study due to not being clinical candidates for the lumbar procedures and/or CBT and/or candidates for the study pr ocedures. We will not include patie nts from special classes of subjects or vulnerable populations such as pregnant women, VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"

Secondary outcomes incl ude dai ly step counts, back pain intensity, reduction in opioid use, an d quality of life. Hypoth eses: 1) Each individual treatment will result in improvements in back -related f unctional limitations and secondary outcomes compared to control, and 2) Combin ed trea tment will produce greater treatment effects than each of the in dividual treatments alone. 4.0 Resour ces and Personnel • This research will be conducted by Dr. Pradeep Suri and the following individuals entirely at VA Puget Sound Health Care System (VA PSHCS) • Dr. Suri is the PI and will be responsible for study planning an d broad oversight; supervi sing stud y procedures; integrity of data collection; interpretation of findings ; and all subsequent steps including manuscr ipt preparation and submission.

For sim plicity of language, henceforth in this protocol we frequentl y refer to simulated LRFA with targe ted steroid injections to the facet nerves as ‘simulated LRFA’. All tr eatments that will be allocated as part of this research are standard -of-care, “active” t reatments expected to improve function and pain in those with CLBP. The study will recruit up to 30 Veterans, with the goal of having 20 Veterans with chronic low back pain (CLBP) who provide complete data for the main study outcome at 3-month follow -up po st- randomization ( the Roland -Morris Disability Questionnaire ), with a minimum of 4 completers of the main 3 - month follow -up outcome in each of the 4 ‘cells’ for treatm ent (see Figure 2). Participants would be blinded to whet her they are receiving the study ‘interventions’ or ‘controls’, over the first 3 months of follow-up. Following the main period o f data collection of 3 months of follow -up post -randomization, for those participants who wish to continue with the study, we w ill continue to collect observat ional data monthly thereafter for the duration of the funding period (up to 9 additional months); such data collection will continue with or without unblinding to part icipant group assignments per the randomization, accordin g to what the participant decide s. Unblinded participants may make subsequent treatment decis ions as they wish, so optional asses sments after the study period may be affected by unblinding and other changes in treatment and are not truly randomized compari sons. Participants who did not r eceive LRFA during the main 3 -month period of follow -up may e lect to pursue LRFA as part of norma l clinical care , and those who receive TBSCE may elect to pursue stand ard video telehealth CBT (a typical ‘extended’ course of CBT). All aspects of interventio n and control treatments will be conducted within the context of existing standard of care clinic al processes at the VAPSHCS Pain Clinic, the Rehabilitation Care Servi ces division, and the VAPSHCS Telerehabilitation Enterpri se-Wide Initiative (TREWI ) progr am (which offers video and telephone telehealth services for a varie ty of target conditions, incl uding CBT for CLBP) . Both LRFA and targeted steroid injections to the facet nerves are commonly performed and standard of care procedures for chronic low back pain in the US.17,24, 25 Although t here are no significan t differences with respect to improvement in functional limitations be tween LRFA and targeted steroid injections in randomized controlled trials , 17,20 targeted steroid injections to the facet nerves likely have a l ower risk profile than LRFA , given th at no nerve destruction occurs . CBT is also widely accepted as standard of care treatment for chronic pain and CLBP, alth ough there are major limitations on the availability of this treatme nt in the US, and for Veteran s.3,4 The AcTIVE -CBT and TBSC E treatment arms in this study correspond to extended and brief courses of CBT, respectiv ely.

Potential physical risks from participating in the study invol ve the same therapeutic risks that would normally be involved with undergoing the LRFA procedure in usual clinical practice (if patients are randomized to the LRFA procedures), or less expected risk than LRFA (if they are ra ndomized to the simulated LRFA p rocedure, which includes targeted facet nerve injections but will not involve the nerve destructi on that is part of LRFA). In other words, risk with simulated LRFA may be less than LRFA, since simulated LRFA does not involve the destruction of the facet ne rves. Potential benefits of the study include receiving benef it in CLBP and functional limitation s from simulated LRFA and targeted steroid injections and not having t o undergo nerve destruction with LRFA. There are no phys ical risks associated with the A cTIVE -CBT and TBSCE treatments. There is potential benefit in terms of improving CLBP and functio nal limitations with both treatments; benefits in the TBSCE treatment (‘brief CBT’) will involve substantially fewer treatment sessions and may be more conveni ent than AcTIVE -CBT (‘extended CBT’) . Other specific risks of the cl inical treatments as routinel y provided in usual clinical care are provided below in plain language typical of what is included in the consent form . Althoug h in some situations, the risks associated with usual clinical care that take place within th e conte xts of a research study might not be described in the research protocol itself, in this instance we describe in detail the risks associated with LRFA. This is done for two main reasons: 1) To avoid any situations in which study participants might no t be aw are of the attendant risks/be nefits of LRFA, a procedure they have sought for treatment of CLBP as part of their normal clinical care. This is relevant beca use in routine clinical care pat ients often have misconceptions about what LRFA involves and what the extensive typical screening process for LRFA typically involves ; and 2) Because simulated LRFA wi th targeted steroid injections in the context of this stu dy represents a less invasive ( not neurodestructive) procedure which may eliminate or avoid t he need for LRFA, and thus, an accur ate sense of risk/benefit and relative risk/benefit relies on knowledg e of both procedures. Physical risks : The LRFA procedu re entails applying anesthetic a round the nerve to the facet joint and applying heat to selec tively destroy the nerv e that suppli es the facet joint. This may result in relief of pain (the goal of the procedure) until the nerve regenerates over the course o f several months , after which ti me low back pain related to the facet joints would be expecte d to resume. LRFA involves the use of x-rays to guide the procedure , and the x -ray radiation amounts invol ved with LRFA are low. The average amount of radiation ex posure from these x -rays will be between 1 -8% of the average exposure any person receives fro m the e nvironment per year. Common risks of LRFA include having no reduction of pain, numbness at the proc edure site, temporarily increased back pain, lowering of your blood pressure, facial flus hing, or increases in blood sugar levels. Less commonly patie nts can have nausea; bleeding, pers istent redness, or swelling at the procedure site; temporary changes in mood or hormone levels; or brief (lasting minutes to hou rs) numbness, weakness, or paral ysis of the back or legs. In rare instances, cardiac arrest; irregul ar heartbeat; seizure; nerve injuries; infections; unexpected allergic reactions; bone problems suc h as bone necrosis; permanent areas of numbness, weakness , worsened pain, or paralysis; s pinal cord damage; stroke ; and death have been reported with LRFA. If a participant were to r eceive simulated LRFA with targeted steroid injections to the facet ner ves without VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"
15,page_15,"VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Version 1.0: 04/2018 Page 16 of 55 destroying the facet nerves as part of this r esearch study, the possible phys ical risks are the same as LRFA , but are generally expected t o be le ss likely than that which wo uld be involved in LRFA, since the nerves are not destroyed. Targeted s teroid injections to the facet nerves involve the use of x-rays to guide the procedure , and the x -ray radiation amounts involved are low. The average amount of radiation exposure from t hese x-rays will be between 1 -8% of the average exposure any person rec eives from the environment per year. Common risks of si mulated LRFA with targeted stero id injections to the facet nerves include no reduction of pai n, temp orary increased back pain, l owering of your blood pressure, facial flushing, or increases in blood sugar levels. Less commonly, patients can have temporary changes in mood or hormone level s, bleeding, persistent redness, or swelling at the procedure site, or brief (lasting minutes to hours) numbness, weakness, or paralysis of back or legs. In rare insta nces, cardiac arrest; irregular heartbeat; seizure; nerve injuries; infections; unexpecte d allergic reactions; bone problems permanent areas of numbne ss, wea kness, worsened pain, or par alysis; spinal cord damage; stroke, and death have been reported with p rocedures of this type. Psychological risks : Any phys ical changes as a result of the LRFA or simulated LRFA procedures may in theory result in psychologi cal distress that is expecte d to be short -term, since any LRFA -related side effects are usually short-term and self -limited. Psychological risks with AcT IVE-CBT or TBSCE are the same ri sks involved in ‘usual care’ behavioral treatments for pain ( such as conventional CBT, mindfulne ss-based stress reduction, hypnosis, etc.). Participants may experience fatigue and/or boredom while completing the research int erviews and/or the AcTIVE -CBT or TBSCE control treatment sessions. Some participants may also experi ence mild anxiety, frustrati on, and/or stress while reporting on their mood and psychologic symptom s, during assessment procedures, and/or during the course of treatment. The two types of behav ioral treatment (AcTIVE -CBT or TBSCE control) involve di scussio ns between the provider/rese arch staff and the participant about pain and related topics that may m ake some individuals feel uncomfortable. However , the AcT IVE-CBT or TBSCE control treatme nts are not expected to involve any serious or long -term risk s to an individual’s health. Socia l, Legal, Privacy, and Other Risks : There are research risks to partic ipants’ privacy associated with inappropriate disclosure of data. Specifically, there is a risk that a participant’s identity and participation in the study may be discovered by an outs ide party. However, we will take various steps as described elsewhere i n the study documents to ensure that the likelihood of su ch risk is negligible. Descript ion of Study Population/Expected Enrollment/Vulnerable Popula tions: We expect to recruit up to 3 0 Veterans in the proposed study in order to obtain 20 Veterans who complete 3-month follow -up for the primary outcome (improve ment in functional limitations), and at least 4 out of 5 participants in each cell of the 2x2 conting ency table (see Figure 2) completing 3 -month fol low-up for the primary outcome. All Veteran partici pants will be patients recruited from VAPSHCS who are see king to have the LRFA procedure for CLBP. There are no other categories of participants allow ed in the study. Further details of inclusion/exclusion criteria are provided below in Table 4 (this is pl aced below in Section 5.4 as specified by the Protocol Te mplate format) . The expected age range of study participants is 18 years of age and older. We will not include patients from spe cial classes of subjects or vulnerable populations such as pregnant wom en, children , cognitively impaired persons, or prisoners, due to possible VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"

We wi ll not otherwise make any exclusions based on gender, sex, ra ce, ethnicity, or any minority group designation. Randomization : MBBs will be performed as per usual clinical care processes in the VAPSHCS Pain C linic. Follo wing usual clinical practice aft er the 2nd set of MBBs, o nce a participant is determined elig ible ba sed on the Final Screening c riteria, including response s to the 2nd set of MBBs, he/she will be sch eduled for a procedure slot when LRFA or simulated LRFA w ill be performed. The specific procedural treatment to be receive d (LRFA vs simulated LRFA) will not be known to the participant or the research staff at the time of scheduling. Description of r andomization procedures below mention the “treating interven tional spine provider” and the “2nd interventio nal spine attending physician” . The “treating interve ntional spine provider” is t he provider who is in charge of a patient’s procedural care in the cour se of usual practice in the VAPSHCS pain clinic. The “2nd interventional spine attending physician” will be another VAPS interventional spine attendin g physi cian who is separate from th e “treating interventional spine provider” previously mentioned. Both t hese physicians will participate in the LRFA and simulate d LRFA procedures as described f urther below; however, the 2nd interventional spine attending physic ian will be engaged as part of the research procedures, and the treating interventional spine provi der will not be engaged as part of the research procedure s. Further description of these two different roles is provided below. The randomization pro cess involves: 1. Treatment assignment s will be stored centrally electronically in a secure database at VAPSH CS. Envelopes containing the treatment assignments (hardc opies) will also be pre -generate d. 2. We will utilize computer -generated permuted -block randomiz ation to achieve roughly balanced groups. We will use random blocks that are not divulged to the research staff involved in recruitment in order to avoid bias in t he recruitment process. Randomiz ation will be stratified by MBB block responses (50 -79% vs. ≥80%). 3. Reminder emails will be sent to the clinical assistant (Pati Irish) and the 2nd interventional spine attending physician the day before the scheduled procedure to remind them that they wil l need to obtain the randomization allocation on the day of the procedure , prior to the procedur e. The 2nd interventional spine attending physician is the second interventional spine attending physician - other than the treating spine provider , who will be in the room during LRFA or simulated LRFA and take part in t hese procedures . Similar emails will be sent on the morning of the procedure . 4. Prior to the lumbar procedure, the clinical assistant and the 2nd interventional spine attending physician will open t he envelopes which reveal the procedural and behavioral trea tment allocations. A non-blinded research staff member will be present to facilitate this and be aware of the treatment allocations. These assignment s contained in the envelopes will direct the 2nd interventional spine attending physician whether to perfor m a standard LRFA or the simulated LRFA, and whether the participant will receive AcTIVE -CBT or TBSCE. A primary function of the clinical assistant is to make sure that the 2nd interventional spin e attending physician knows and performs the allocated treat ment on the day of the procedure. 5. On the day of the procedure, once the randomization status is known, the non-blinded research staff member and the PI , Dr. Suri , will communicate regarding the pa rticipant’s assignment to AcTIVE -CBT or TBSCE. Dr. Suri will then place clinical orders in CPRS for telehealth CBT for pain. These orders will specify whether the order is for a brief course of CBT for pain with education and self-directed plan for progres sion (TBSCE) or an extended course of CBT for pain (AcTIVE -CBT). The non -blinded research staff member will also communicate directly with the treating CBT provider to clarify that the patient is a study participant. The participant will then be scheduled for VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"
17,page_17,"VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Version 1.0: 04/2018 Page 18 of 55 the first session of AcTIVE -CBT or TBSCE, which generall y will take place within 1 -3 weeks o f the procedure date whenever possible. 6. On the day of the procedure, prior to revealing each participant’s randomization assignment, we will ensure that we have completed the following aspects of data collection and/or r eport forms: participant contact Inf ormation, the Screening Log (described further below) Informed Consent (Attachment T – Consent, described further below), and b aseline questionnaires (the baseline study assessment, pre-randomization, described f urther b elow in ‘Study Measures’) . The Screening Log is a tracking document used for internal study purposes. Description of LRFA and simulated LRFA control procedures : After the treatment alloca tion for a given participant is known to the clinical assist ant and 2nd interventional spine pro vider, that participant will undergo their lumbar procedure (LRFA or simulated LRFA). Two experienced board -certified pain medicine attending physicians, one of whom is the participant’s ‘treating’ physician who performe d the sc reening MBBs (the ‘treating interventional spine provider’) , will perform each LRFA procedure. To permit provider blinding, the treating interventional spine provider will place LRFA elect rodes at each spinal level to be treated, and will then leav e the procedure room, subsequently r emaining blinded to allocation. The 2nd interventional spine attending physician (unblinded, not involved in data collection or further care of the participant) will then administer the allocated LRFA treatment or simula ted control. Fo r the LRFA group, thi s involves making a radiofrequency lesion, repositioning the electrode, and making a 2nd RFA lesion, at each medial branch target. For the simulated LRFA group, this involves the placement of electrodes as would normally be done during LRFA, but without ma king RFA lesions. The 2nd interventional spine attending physician who will conduct most LRFA and simulated LRFA procedures in this study will be Dr. Bosco So ares, a board -certified Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R ) physic ian with subspecialty accreditation in Pain Medicine. For study participants whose treating physician is Dr. Soares, the 2nd interventional spine attending physician will be Dr. Nis hio or Dr. Dawson . Drs. Nishio and Dawson are board -certifie d anesth esiolog ist physician s with s ubspecialty accreditation in Pain Medicine. Dr s. Soares , Nishio , and Dawson teach LRFA procedures to Pain Medicine fellows in the UW Accreditation Council for G raduate Medical Education ( ACGME )-accredited Pain Medicine fellowshi p. As shown in Table 2 , Dr. Soares will not be blinded to randomization unless (for a given participant) he is the treating interventional spine provider, in which case he WILL be blinded. Conversely, Dr. Nishio will be blinded to randomization sta tus, unless (fo r a given participant ) he is acting as the 2nd interventional spine attending physician (Dr. Nishio will often be the 2nd interventional spine attending physician in those instances when Dr. Soares is the treating interventional spine provid er).Similarly, Dr. Dawson will be bl inded to randomization status, unless (for a given participant) he is acting as the 2nd interventional spine attending physician (Dr. Dawson will sometimes be t he 2nd interventional spine attending physician in those ins tances w hen Dr. Soares is the treati ng interventional spine provider).

18,page_18,"VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Version 1.0: 04/2018 Page 19 of 55 LRFA Technique: The LRFA technique to be used in this research is consistent with current practices among our VAPSHCS LRF A providers and with the highest clinical standards availabl e, including th ose detailed in the S pinal Intervention Society Practice Guidelines for Spinal Diagnostic and Treatment Procedures, 2nd edition. Briefly, LRFA involves initially positioning a spina l needle at each ‘facet nerve’ (medial branch of the dorsal ramus) that wil l be ablated, in the same manner in which medial branch blocks are typically performed, and administering local anesthetic to the nerve and the immediately surrounding muscles, cove ring a volume consistent with the expected size of the regio n to be ablated . The needle is then left in place, serving as a pointer to the nerve target site. A radiofrequency electrode is then placed along the course of the medial branch, using a fluorosco pic declined view approach with cross -table obliquity as nee ded to achieve electrode placement p arallel to the medial branch, to the target point marked by the spinal needle tip. Once the electrode is positioned, sensory stimulation is performed at 50 H z up to 1 millivolt until the patient reports axial and no extr emity sensation to further confirm a ppropriate location of the electrode. The intensity of sensory stimulation where the patient reports sensation will be noted by the clinical assistant and 2nd interventional spine attending physician. Motor stimulation i s performed at 2 Hz up to 4 volts (but typically no more than 2 volts) to confirm that there is no motor stimulation of the ventral nerve root causing muscle contraction. If there is motor stimula tion of the ventral nerve root, the electrode is repositione d and th e stimu lation sequence is re peated until the correct electrode position is confirmed. If unable to achieve sensory stimulation, a lesion would not be attempted at that level. Once the elec trode is in correct position and stimulation testing complet ed, a lesion is generated by raising the temperature at about 1°C per second, from 37°C to an operating temperature between 80°C and 85°C, which is maintained for 90 seconds. The electrode will th en be repositioned slightly by withdrawing or repositioning parallel to the 1st ablation site , or by rotating the electrode, and a 2nd lesion will be made. If at any time during the raising of the temperature, or during the coagulation, the patient reports adverse sensations, the generator will be immediately turne d off and the sensation evaluated. D epending on provider preference as part of routine clinical care, local corticosteroid injections may be used to decrease the likelihood and/or severity of a po st-LRFA ‘neuritis’ , worsening of back pain that can be due t o the nerve abl ation/lesioning itsel f. This process is then repeated for each medial branch nerve that is targeted (typically 2 or more medial branches per LRFA procedure). Simulated LRFA with ta rgeted steroid injections technique: The simulated LRFA cont rol will be per formed in an identica l fashion to LRFA as above, except that 1) after electrode positioning, a neurodestructive lesion is not made; 2) a targeted corticosteroid injection will be ad ministered at each targeted medial branch prior to the 1st simulated lesion ing; 3) a pre - recorde d audio recording of the procedure will be played by the clinical assistant (out of view of the patient, immediately adjacent to the RFA machine) in order to si mulate the beeping and other sounds of the machine and to en sure the approp riate length of the s imulated procedure, and 4) the 2nd interventional spine attending physician will turn on sensory stimulation for a short period of at least 3 seconds towards th e end of the simulated lesion time, maintaining stimulation intensit y no hi gher than the level w here sensory input was initially noted by the patient during testing. The electrode will remain in place for the full 90 seconds that lesioning would normally r equire , but without heat application. The VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"

This process would then be repeated for each medial branch nerve that is targeted (2 or more medial branches per simulat ed LRFA procedure) . Targeted corticosteroid injections will consist of a to tal injectate quantit y per patient not to exceed the eq uivalent of 40-80 mg triamcinolone , divided equally among medial branch sites to be targeted. Lower doses of corticosteroid ma y be used as per the providers’ clinical discretion. Desc ription o f AcTI VE CBT vs. TBSCE CBT treatments The AcTIVE -CBT treatment involves eight 60 -minute treatment sessions spaced over 3 months, delivered via clinical video telehealth methods by clinica l psychologists to Veterans in their homes. Psychologists will refer to Fitbit output during the initial evaluation and each treatment session, including reminders and tips about Fitbit use, evaluating step count homework, and tracking overall progress tow ards goals ; the protocol for AcTIVE -CBT is provided as Attac hment KK – AcTIVE-CBT Workbook . The TBSCE treatment involves an initial 60 -minute telephone education session by a psychologist including education on CBT principles ; the provision of an education al book for CBT self -management (‘Managing Pain Before It Manages You ’ by M argaret A. Caudill PhD) and orientation to the workbook ;43 and a structured plan for weekly reading and homework using the workbook43. The content of TBSCE interactions in the one initial 60-minute session is as per Attachment MM, but can be adapted to follow psychologists’ typical practices for patients beginning CBT for pain who are interested in th e treatme nt but are unable to contin ue with further sessions. In addition, the psychologist providing TBSCE will contact the participant at the approximate midpoint of the 3 -month follow -up period to reinforce key concepts as needed, encourage continued pa rticipant -direc ted use of the plan f or weekly reading and workbook use, and answer questions. The psychologist will also be available by phone to address any a reas of concern or participant questi ons during follow -up. TBSCE represents a focused yet ‘active ’ treatme nt bey ond what is normally provided after LRFA. Around the time of the start of behavioral treatmen ts for participants in both the AcTIVE -CBT and TBSCE arms, research staff will provide a written summary of certain data elements from Visit 0 and 1 , reflect ing th e same type of inform ation that would be obtained during an initial clinical evaluation for CBT. This written information will be shared in the form of Attachment NN (‘Brief Summary Baseline Data’ form). The purpose of this is to provide inf ormation to the therapist that will be useful in understanding the participant’s baseline status and thus providing effective clinical care. These data elements will includ e report of pain intensi ty, number of pain locations, treatment expectancy, hours missed from work or volunteer activiti es, CLBP -related functional limitations, and past treatments for CLBP. The Brief Summary Baseline Data form (Attachment NN) will be generated by research staff and sent to the clinical therapist using the secure VHA Priv acy Act/H IPAA E nvelope or fax or enc rypted email . If a fax is sent, once the fax receipt has been confirmed at the destination location (confirmed by the therapist ), the original form will be dest royed via placement in a designated shredding bin (by the research staff me mber ). If the therapi st is located at Seattle campus, the research staff can come to the clinical area for a direct handoff of the Brief Summary Baseline Data form. Once the form is handed to the clinical therapist, the therapist can review this info rmatio n and record whatever information they would normally do as per their usual clinical p ractice, in the medical record. T he clinical therapist will then destroy the form via placement in a designated shredding bin, not retaining the record for future u se, so as to limit potentia l risk for privacy issues.

20,page_20,"VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Version 1.0: 04/2018 Page 21 of 55 In order to avoid imparting biases regarding which treatment is the ‘intervention’ and which the ‘control’, AcTIVE -CBT is referred to as ‘extended CBT’ in the Informed Consent documents and all discussi ons wi th the patient, and T BSCE treatment is referred to as ‘brief CBT’ in the Informed Consent documents and all discussions with the participant. The AcTIVE CBT and TBSCE control condi tions will both be delivered by licensed Clinical Psychologi sts with specif ic expertise in cogni tive-behavioral therapy and its application to the treatment of chronic pain. Both treating psychologists have appointments within Rehabilitation Care Services at VAPSHCS and are approved for clinical telehealth service modalities. Bot h study psychologists will be instructed by Dr. Williams in the aspects of clinical CBT treatment to be provided for participants in this study, but are considered clinical staff pr oviding standard -of-care clinical services for chronic pain, and thus not a ctively engaged in th e research procedures. Participants receiving a given treatment (AcTIVE CBT or TBSCE) will generally receive the same information ; however , we expect some varia tion in the amount of time spent on each topic and the speci fic langu age us ed to convey material s. As per usual clinical practice, psychologists will tailor the information in whatever way is indicated to ensure understanding of the content, and to provide individualized support based on personalized goals, barrier s, and ab ilities. If patients specif ically request to have one or more in -person sessions of either AcTIVE -CBT or TBSCE in lieu of video telehealth or telephone (respectively), therapists will acc ommodate such requests as their clinical schedules and avail ability allow. ACTIVE -CBT Psycholo gists providing the AcTIVE -CBT intervention will receive reports on a participant’s Fitbit output and compliance in advance of each treatment session. We will s trive to schedule the AcTIVE -CBT sessions at consistent days /times wi thin t he week if possible, to facilitate routine and attendance. We will also attempt to schedule sessions evenly across the 3 -month follow -up period, to ensure adequate practice time for patients between sessions. AcTIVE -CBT sessions will general ly begin with a review of the Fitbit -related output provided by research staff, to gauge ac tivity since the prior session. Sessions will typically include activity plans, expectations , and goals f or the next session and long -term. The schedule, scope, and content o f trea tment as part of the AcTIVE -CBT are similar in scope and content to typical CBT for chronic pain as provided in the RCS service line, but have been specifically tailored for low bac k pain based on the results of recent successful RCT.3,4 Some key dif ferenc es between AcTIVE -CBT and the standard video -based CBT treatment a vailable at VAPSHCS include a greater focus on encouraging walking and physical activity , using the Fitbit Zip unit s, and greater emphasis on understanding fl are-ups and relap se preven tion. The components of AcT IVE-CBT are presented in Table 1 below and details of the treatments are found in the patient workbook ( Attachment KK – AcTIVE -CBT Workbook ). Please note that p atient workbook is distinct from the therapist/psychologist manual (Attachm ent JJ – AcTIVE -CBT Manual). AcTIVE -CBT is meant to be responsive to clinical needs and realities, and if needed, the timing, order, and intensity of these components may vary slightly depending on the specific s of the individual participant , but all will be covered during the 3-month treatment period.

TBSCE Participants in the TBSCE arm will also receive the Fitbit Zip units , but education and treatme nt will not be specifically structured around the Fitbit. TBSCE will begin with a 60 -minute educational session by a rehabilitation psychologist conducted over the telephone . It will be followed by one brief phone call (10-20 minutes i n length) from the re habilitation psychologist to the participant between 1 -2 months af ter the initial TBSCE session. TBSCE steps follow the structured CBT program included in the b ook “Managing Pain Before It Manages You ” by Caudill , supple mented by a wor kbook that we have de veloped for TBSCE. The Caudill book taken together with the workbook are sufficiently detailed that a participant can independently learn the concepts and compl ete exercises. The workbook includes many of the same topics covered in the AcTIVE -CBT treatment , but in a different order, and without a specific focus on physical activity. Participants will be encouraged to set weekly goals for working through the sess ions in the book and completing the assigned readings . At the introdu ctory phone consultation , psychologists will advise participants in setting up a specific written schedule for completing the workbook sections and activities over the 3 -month period that the participant will record in their treatment manual (with specific dates when completion of c ontent for a session is expected to be completed). Long -term activity goals and weekly activity goals will be discussed, and these will also be recorded by the patient in the patient treatment manual ( Attachment LL – TBSCE Manual (Instructions) ). Weekly wo rkbook homework will include: 1) education on chronic pain, 2) theories of pain and diaphragmatic breathing, 3) progressive muscle relaxation and visual imagery , 4) automatic thoughts and p ain, 5) cognitive restructuring , 6) stre ss management, 7) time -base d pacing, 8) pleasant activity scheduling, 9) anger management, 10) sleep hygiene, and 11) relapse prevention and flare -up planning. We may make non -substantiv e changes to AcTIVE -CBT and TBSCE manuals, workbooks, and pr ovider scripts as the study proceeds . Any substantive changes will be submitted to the IRB for further review. Quality Assurance After each session of AcTIVE -CBT, therapists will complete a brief checklist to document the content areas covered in each ses sion (see Attac hment OO). These chec klists will be used to assess the quality of the AcTIVE -CBT treatment and that major content areas have been covered . Checklists will be retained in a locked fi le cabinet in the therapist’s locked treatment room/office u ntil the l ast treatment session is completed. After the last treatment session is completed , the therapist will send the checklist to research staff using the secure VHA Privacy Act/HIPAA Envelope or fax or encrypted email . If a fax is sent, once the fax r eceipt has been confirmed at the des tination location (confirmed by discussion or email with research staff), the original checklist will be destroyed via placement in a designated shredding bin ( by the therapist). If the therapist is located at Seattle ca mpus, the resea rch staff can come to the clinical area for a direct handoff of the checklist. Checklists will be collected by research staff and used to track treatment quality /content covered for each participant. These checklists will be treated in the same manne r as study question naires, using the same methods for data security. VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"

24,page_24,"VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Version 1.0: 04/2018 Page 25 of 55 Blinding Strategy: Blinding with respec t to the lumbar procedures (LRFA vs. simulated LRFA) : 1. Partic ipants and treati ng intervent ional spine providers will be blinded to the status of LRFA vs. simulated LRFA. The PI Dr. Suri and Dr. Williams will not be blinded, since they are the overseeing study clinicians. Further details are provided below in Table 2. 2. For blinding p urposes, bot h LRFA and simulated LRFA will be performed in an identical fashion with the exception of medial branch lesioning, which will not be done in the simulated LRFA group , as described above . Duration and sounds of both the LRFA and simulated LRFA procedures wi ll be similar. Both LRFA and simulated LRFA will apply all safety precautions normally used in our facility such as not using general anesthesia, and the use of both s ensory and motor stimulation to avoid incorrect electrode pl acement (describe d further be low). 3. During the procedure (LRFA or simulated LRFA), the treating interventional spine provider will make initial placements of all LRFA electrodes to be used in that procedure as he/she would do normally for LRFA . Once the tr eating interventi onal spine p rovider has placed all LRFA electrodes, the treating interventional spine provider will leave the room and subsequently remain blinded to the procedure allocation (i.e . the randomization to LRFA vs. simulated LRFA). The 2nd interventional spine attending p hysicia n will take over the procedure once the treating interventional spine provider leaves the room; the 2nd interventional spine attending physician will not be bli nded to the procedure allocation. After the treating interve ntional spine pro vider leaves the ro om, the 2nd interventional spine attending physician will either use the radiofrequency machine in the appropriate manner for standard LRFA by lesioning the ner ve, or administer the therapeutic MBB (for the control proce dure) and apply the simulated LRFA l esion. During simulated LRFA, a recording will be played (Attachment X – Simulated LRFA Recording ), by either the 2nd interventional spine attending physician o r the clinical assistant, to simulate the typical sounds of LRFA. Additionall y, the 2nd interven tional spine attending physician will turn on sensory stimulation for a short period of at least 3 seconds towards the end of each simulated lesion time, mainta ining stimulation intensity no higher than the level where s ensory input was initially no ted by the patient during testing. The 2nd interventional spine attending physician will then make a slight reposition ing of the LRFA needle to a 2nd location, and adm inister the 2nd lesion (or the simulated 2nd lesion ). If the simulated LRFA p rocedure is perform ed, the 2nd interventional spine attending physician or clinical assistant will turn on the audio recording of the LRFA at any times that the lesioning of the n erves would normally occur. Additionally, the 2nd interventi onal spine attend ing physicia n will again turn on sensory stimulation for a short period of at least 3 seconds towards the end of each simulated lesion time, maintaining stimulation intensity no higher than the level where sensory input was initially noted by the patient d uring testin g. 4. The patient and the treating interventional spine provider are therefore blinded to the procedural treatment received. We will employ several strategies to ensure patients are not able to determine which intervention they r eceive based on t he sounds an d lengt h of the procedure: i. We will enroll only patients who have not had prior LRFA ii. The electrode will remain in place for the full 90 seconds (and repositioned to simulate a second lesion) for each simulated lesion site. iii. We will use a pre -recorded aud io reco rding of an LRFA procedure in order to simulate the sounds made by the machine during the ablation. We will pre -test this recording several times in the pain cl inic in advance of the first randomization. iv. We will use a br ief period of sen sory stimula tion du ring the simulated LRFA lesion as described above. 5. In some clinical situations, it may be impossible for a 2nd interventional spine attending to be on hand to c omplete a LRFA or simulated LRFA procedure, and maintain bli nding of the trea ting interve ntional spine provider. For instance, a clinical situation may call that provider away or detain VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"
25,page_25,"VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Version 1.0: 04/2018 Page 26 of 55 that individual. In such an instance, the treating interventional sp ine provider will become unblinded. 6. In the event that parti cipants who are r andomized to LRFA v s. simulated LRFA subsequently wish to go on to receive the treatment they were not randomized to, or wish to go on to another lumbar - related procedure that for some reason necessitates that the participant become unblin ded to the treatm ent they wer e rando mized to, prior to the end of the 3-month main follow -up period of data collection , we will unblind participants to their treatment status. This will be done b y informing the treating interventional spine provider of th e procedural trea tment receiv ed (LRFA vs. simulated LRFA ) prior to a clinical appointment with the participant. The Veteran participant and their provider will then have the information needed to confer and make a fully informed decision about the next clinical treatment s teps that ar e most appropriate for the Veteran. Blinding with respect to CBT treatments (AcTIVE -CBT vs. TBSCE ): 7. It is not possible to blind patients and rehabilitation psychol ogists to whether or not they are receiving AcTIVE -CBT or TB SCE. To limit the potential f or infl uencing participants’ perceptions of the interventions as more or less likely to be effective, participants will not be specifically told which of the AcTIVE -CBT or TBSCE treatments represents the intervention of interes t or the control treatment in the cu rrent study. They will however have full advance knowledge of what the treatments will actually entail.

The length of the run -in period w ill be at least 1 week; this period of time for the run-in is substantially shorter than the typical period involved in cu rrent clinical care in the VAPS Pain Clinic between the 2nd/ last set of MBBs and the date of LRFA ( ~ weeks on average) , and thu s will be nested within usual clinical scheduling practices . • Randomization (Visit 2 ): to reevaluate whether there have been any changes to the Final Screening Criteria, reassessed on the d ay of randomizat ion o Participants will n ot be randomized if they fai l Final Screening criteria o If a study participant is not able to be reached by phone or in -person at least one time during the run-in period, they will not be randomized o If a study partici pant is unable t o use the Fitbit Zips, they will be categorized as ‘non-Fitbit- compliant’. They will be able to continue in the study, but the randomization will be stratified by ‘Fitbit -complian t’ vs. ‘non -Fitbit -compliant’ status. Those ineligible for the study, those who decline to partici pate, and those who particip ate but later are deemed ineligible and are not randomized (i.e. those who fail the run -in period) will continue to be seen in th e VAPSHCS Pain Clinic and will continue to receive appropria te care for CLBP , which may include LRFA or cognitive behavioral th erapy ( CBT) for pain for appropriate patients. Usual Care for MBBs and LRFA at VAPSHCS : Usual practice in the VAPSHCS Pain Clin ic involves screening patients with CLBP for LRFA eligibilit y with 2 separat e sets of MBBs. This is done because the temporary pain re lief that happens with MBBs (temporary anesthetic blocks of the ‘medial branch nerves ’) simulates the type of pain relief that should occur with LRFA (when the nerves are ablated [de stroyed]). At VA PSHCS these 2 sets of M BBs are scheduled, on averag e, abou t 3 weeks apart. Individuals who have ‘positive’ responses to MBBs (temporary resolution or marked improvement of CLBP) on both occasions, and meet other clinical c riteria, are eligi ble for LRFA. Those who do not have pos itive responses to MBBs, or do not meet other clinical criteria, are not eligible for having LRFA because they will not benefit from the procedure. 2 sets of screening MBBs are the highest standard of care for selecte d LRFA candidate s in the US because up to 50% of patients who have positiv e responses to 1 set of screening MBBs are having ‘false positive’ responses and would not respond to LRFA. The performanc e of MBBs in usual clinical practice always requires fluoros copy (x -rays) to position the spinal needles in the appropriate loc ations; fluoroscopy is always needed for LRFA for the same reason in usual VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"
27,page_27,"VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Version 1.0: 04/2018 Page 28 of 55 clinical practice. At VAPSHCS, LRFA is typically sched uled for a time within 3 weeks after the 2nd set of MBBs. Usual care in th e VAPSHCS Pain Clinic r equires that MBB candidates meet se veral clinical criteria for safety/appropriateness reasons. Exclusion criteria are 1) possible pregnancy or other conditio n that precludes fluoroscopy use, 2) contraindications to MB Bs, such as alle rgy to local anesthetic or contrast, 3) other contr aindica tions to receiving MBBs, and 4) any contraindications to LRFA itself (for example, patients on anticoagulation which canno t be held or bridged appropriately for the LRFA procedure) . Pre-Screening : We have a HIPAA waive r to be able to screen patie nts for preliminary eligibility among those who are scheduled to receive lumbar MBBs for chronic axial low back pain in the VAPSH CS Pain Clinic. Study staff will review Computerized Patient Record System ( CPRS) records of all pa tients scheduled for lumbar MBBs in the VAPSHCS Pain Clinic. This initial medical record screening protocol involves assessment of those criteria from Table 4 which can be assessed by CPRS record review. Ideally, pote ntial participan ts will be identified p rior to the 1st set of MBBs that is typically performed in routine interventional spine clinical care for those with CLBP in the VAPSHCS Pain Clinic. When pa tients are identified who meet preliminary eligibility criteria on the medic al record screening, st aff will alert the “treating interv entional spine provider” (the interventional spine physician in the Pain Clinic who is performing the MBB procedure). Rese arch staff would contact the treating interventional spine p rovider via encr ypted email, telephone, or in-person to alert them when a particular Veteran who appears to be eligible for the study based on medical record screening protocol will be attending a n upcoming appointment. Due to typical clinical procedures i n the Pain Clini c, we do not anticipate that providers will attempt to rec ruit any patients in situations where they have not received an alert from research study staff that a patient has passed pre-screening and may be an appropriate participant. That vi sit, and the MBB procedure, would take place in the normal fashion for cli nical care . Treating interventional spine providers will have available in their clinic rooms a list of the major clinical criteria for study inclusion (Attachment J – Interventional Spine Provider Checklist ); this list i s a reference to aid the cli nician in recognition of eligible participants, and is not used for data collection. After the MBB procedure, if the treating int erventional spine provider believes the patient to be eligib le for study participation, the provide r will briefly introduce the study (this will serve as the introduction by non -study personnel) and can provide a flyer with study information (Attachment K - Recruitment Flyer ). If the patient expresses interest in b eing contacted a nd learning more about the study, the treating inte rventio nal spine provider will alert study staff to initiate contact with the patient. Research staff will initiate contact with the Veteran by one of two methods: 1) in -person contact with the Veteran potential participant whil e they are in the VAPSHCS Pa in Clin ic area, either after the 1st set of MBBs, or before/after the 2nd set of MBBs, and/or 2) by telephone (if the potential p articipant has given verbal permission for subsequent phone contacts by stud y staff). At the time o f an in -person contact with the Vet eran participant, research staff will provide each potential participant with a copy of a ‘What to Expect’ (Initial Contac t) informational form (Attachment PP) and a blank copy of the study consent, so the participant can read more about what the st udy wou ld entail, at their leisure. If initial contact is begun in clinic and later completed by telephone, the ‘ What to Expect’ (Initial Contact) informational form ( Attachment PP) and a b lank copy of the study consent will be sent by mail to the particip ant. Additionally, interested Veterans who are given contact information related to the study by the treating interventional spi ne provider may contact research staff to initiate eligibili ty screening or assessments at any time.

Low back pain intensity is meas ured using the numerical rating scale (NRS), with NRS ≥ 4 for study inclusion (i.e., NRS must be 4 or higher). See Table 4 (placed in Section 5.4 as required by the Protocol format ) below for a complete and detailed li st of inclusion and exclusion c riteria, and rationale/indications for exclusion criteria. Among other criteria, eligible patients will be identified based on their responses to MBBs performed according to routine clinical practice in the VAPSHCS Pain Cli nic. Interventional providers i n the VAPSHCS Pain Clinic use either lidocaine or bupivaca ine anesthetic. Table 3 lists technical details that must be met for MBBs to be counted as ‘positive responses’ . These criteria will be assessed by research staff, wit h clarifications as needed by t he PI and the treating interventional spine provider. Table 3 and Table 4 assume that the 1st set of MBBs is performed with lidocaine and the 2nd set of MBBs is performed with bupiv acaine as per our usual practice. However, c linicians may, for clinical rea sons , elect to perform the 1st set of MBBs with lidocaine and the 2nd with bupiv acaine, both the 1st and 2nd sets with lidocaine, or both the 1st and 2nd sets with bupiv acaine. Any of these combinations are acceptable for the purposes of this study provide d that 2 sets of MBBs are used for screening (Table 3 ). Table 3.

For instance, if a potential participant reports 6/10 pain pre -MBBs, and achieves 1/10 pain post -MBBs, pain relief would be conside red to be ongoing at the point where pain intensity was reported as 3/10, but not at the point where pain intensity was reported as 4/10 . Depen ding on the distribution of rec ruited participants’ MBB responses (50-79% vs. ≥80%) after the initial period of recruitment, we may restrict study participation in the participant selection phase in order to oversample participants who have ≥80% relief wit h MBBs.

Patients will be blinded to the thresholds of % improvement that define a ‘positive response’. A. Initial Screening: We will pre -arrange permission to approach p atients with chronic low back pain presenting to the VAPSHCS system Pain Clinic, who meet the Initial Screening criteria from Table 4 (including but not limited to ≥50% pain improvement with MBBs as performed in routine clinical practice in our institution). Patients who appear to meet Initial Screening criteria will be approached to participate in this trial by research staff. i. Research staff will identify patients s cheduled for a 1st set of lumbar MBBs (either notified at the time of scheduling by the clinic scheduling coordinator or from scanning the upcoming clinic schedule) that appear to meet Initial Screenin g criteria, as described above. A pre -screening checkli st will be used (Attachment L - Screening Checklist ). ii. If a potential participant is identified in pre -screening, research staff will then inform the treating spine provider who is scheduled to perform the 1st set of MBBs, to alert them that an upcoming patient might be a potential study participant. This will remind the treating spine provider to consider whether the patient might be a potential study participant once the normally scheduled clinical evaluation has been completed. iii. The normally scheduled cl inical evaluation, including MBBs, will take place. After the 1st set of MBBs is performed for a patient, as per usual clinical practice, the provider will elicit an initial post-MBB assessment of typical low back pain intensity using a 0 to 10 numerical r ating scale (NRS), which will be compared to the pre -MBB assessment of low back pain intensity using a 0 to 10 NRS. Comparison of the post - and pre -MBB NRS scores will yield a proportion for % improvement of typical low back pain. As per usual clinical pra ctice, the provider will also apply the other criteria as described in Table 3 in determining whether a positive response to MBBs is present. Treating spine providers will also have available a ‘checklist’ of the major clinical eligibility criteria, so the y can easily be reminded of the main points that would identify a potential study participant. If they feel such is clinically appropriate, and participants are interested in learning more about the study, the provider will notify the research staff member that a potential participant can be approached. Research staff will be stationed in an adjacent, yet separate, clinical area, and will be available to talk to the potential participant in a private area, to learn more about the study. If a potential parti cipant is only interested in receiving written information, they will be provided with a study flyer. VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"

Research staff will describe the study, answer any questions, and elicit information to complete the Initial Screening assessment (see Table 4 for inclus ion/exclusion criteria) and collect basic demographic data only. Those patients who are interested in participation and meet study criteria will be followed to determine continued eligibility as per study criteria over time. Potential participants will be informed that they will also be re -contacted by phone within 2 -5 days after the day when the 1st set of MBBs was completed, and that at a later time (when and/or after they return for their next routine clinical appointment for their 2nd set of MBBs) they will be reassessed to complete final screening. This includes the outcome of the 2nd set of MBBs that would normally be offered as part of clinical care to patients who have positive responses to a 1st set of MBBs. As part of usual care processes post -MBBs in the VAPSHCS Pain Clinic, patients complete a written pain diary to record low back pain intensity using a 0 to 10 NRS for up to 2 days after the procedure. As part of usual care, patients post -MBBs also receive a follow -up phone call from a nurse coord inator within 1 week of their MBBs (an d usually within several days). In addition to phone contacts with potential participants, research staff will refer to this clinical information as needed to ascertain if ‘positive’ MBB responses have occurred. v. If a potential participant who is approached after the 1st set of MBBs does not wish to speak to research staff or cannot do so at the time of their clinical appointment, we will offer those individuals a phone call to continue providing information about the s tudy, determine eligibility, and obtain information about positive responses to the 1st set of MBBs. Those who are unsure about providing permission to speak to research staff by telephone will be provided written information about the study, and asked to contact research study staff if they are interested in the study, ideally within 2 -5 days of their 1st set of MBBs. vi. If research staff is unable to make contact with a potentially eligible patient on the day when the 1st set of MBBs is completed, contacts w ill be made by telephone as mentioned above, by staff within 2 -5 days of the 1st set of MBBs. In those cases, research staff will inquire retrospectively about responses to MBBs in the initial hours and days after the 1st set of MBBs. Research staff will refer to clinical information from pain diaries and the nurse coordinator follow -up phone call as needed to ascertain if ‘positive’ MBB responses occurred and to identify individuals with non-concordant responses to MBBs (for example, pain lasting >24 hours after a 1st set of MBBs using lidocaine). Individuals with non -concordant responses to MBBs will not be eligible for participation. vii. Participants who decline study participation at any stage in Screening (Initial or Final) may be asked whether they would answer questions (up to 6 questions) about their reasons for non - participation. Such questions would be recorded in a non -identifiable format, without links to any patient identifiers of any kind. viii. Depending on the distribution of recruited participants ’ MBB responses (50 -79% vs. ≥80%) after the initial period of recruitment, we may restrict study participation in the participant selection phase in order to ov ersample participants who have ≥80% reli ef with MBBs (which would affect both the Initial and Final Screening criteria for p otential participants) . ix. If a potential participant is identified after their MBBs have already been completed, or not approached at the usual time of an initial or final screening for another reason, we will send the participant an approach letter ( Attachment ZZZ – Approach Letter ) and a FAQ document with information about the study (Attachment ZZZ2 – Approach Letter FAQ ). These documents will prompt the Veteran to contact research study staff if they wish to hear more information about the study, or if he/she is not interested in the study. If we do not hear back from Veterans who are mailed the approach letter and FAQ within 4 business days, we will make attempts to contact the Veteran by telephone until a contact is made, leaving voicemail messages a s needed.

Final Screening (Visit 1): The final screening process takes place after the potential RCT participant has undergone the 2nd set of MBBs. i. Initial Screening Criteria will be repeated, as per Table 4. ii. Eligible participants will be offered Inf ormed Consent. They will be informed that they will be likely trial participants, unless subsequent selection criteria render them ineligible in the run -in period between the time of Informed Consent, and the day of their LRFA or simulated LRFA procedure w hen they will be randomized. Further details regarding Informed Consent are provided below. iii. If participants decide to participate in the study and complete Informed Consent, in most cases, participants will be scheduled for a future date for their lumbar p rocedure (LRFA procedure or simulated control procedure) at the time of their 2nd set of MBBs, generally within 1 -3 weeks, as per usual clinical practice and using usual clinical processes for scheduling. Research staff will coordinate with clinical staff about scheduling specifics as needed in order to facilitate this and make these transitions smooth for the participant. If for an individual participant, their physician elects to not schedule a future procedure date until a later time, research staff will monitor clinical processes and plan around the future procedure date at the time it is decided upon. iv. After the time when the future lumbar procedure date is decided upon, patients will be scheduled for their 1st assessment with a rehabilitation psycholog ist for AcTIVE -CBT or TBSCE control, which will generally begin within 1 -3 weeks of the LRFA procedure. Such scheduling will also be done through usual clinical processes for scheduling. Research staff will coordinate with clinical staff about scheduling s pecifics as needed in order to facilitate that this is done smoothly. v. Participants will be provided with a Fitbit Zip unit and instructed on how to use the unit. We will assign subjects a login name (e.g., FitbitSel165, FitbitSel672, etc.) and a password f or the Fitbit website, and guide the participant through processes for using the website so they can become familiarized with how it works. We will create a Gmail account for the participant, which matches the Fitbit login name, to be used for the duration of this study. Fitbit will use the email address provided to send system -generated weekly updates about the subject’s activity levels. The Fitbit account will use the participants login name rather than their actual name. The Fitbit website displays the f ollowing data to each user: the number, intensity, and timing of steps taken per day, distance covered, and calories burned. We will request participants not to make edits to the ir Fitbit accounts during their participation in the study, but to contact res earch staff who will make such changes for them. An example of this might be if a participant forgets their password information or wishes to change their password; if this happens, the participant would call research staff to change to a new password. We will ask the participants to set up their Fitbit profile so that others cannot view their personal information for the 3 -month main period of data collection. During the initial set -up we will verify that the Privacy Settings on each participant’s Fitbit p rofile are set so that no one other than the subject can view their personal information (age, height, weight, etc.). Participants will be instructed on how to upload (‘sync’) their Fitbit data regularly (ideally, every other day, but at least once every 7 days). vi. After instructing subjects on how to use the Fitbit, we will mask the Fitbit display screen by turning it around in its case , and we will ask subjects to wear the Fitbit with the display screen covered for the duration of the run -in period. This wi ll allow us to establish how many steps they typically take when not receiving feedback from the Fitbit device or website (i.e., their baseline). Data from the first 7 -day period during the run -in period where the Fitbit is used on at least 3 out of 7 days , for at least 6 hours during waking hours on each of those 3 days, will constitute the baseline assessment for step counts. During the run -in period, we will ask participants to try to use the website as little as possible or to only use the Fitbit websit e when syncing the Fitbit, and to try to not view their Fitbit data on the website. On the day of randomization, we will ask subjects to reveal their display screen by turning the ir Fitbit around VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"

It will remind participants about frequent syncing, maintain the masking, and limiting use o f the Fitbit website as possible. Participants will have a chance to read the pledge and ask questions, and confirm verbally that they understand the pledge and agree to its content. Participants can keep the pledge form. viii. We will also provide participant s with the option to meet with designated research staff at VAPSHCS Seattle campus at any time during the first 3 months after randomization that they wish, to review Fitbit related questions, syncing practices, and/or get a refresher demonstration on how to use their devices and the Fitbit website. ix. As part of routine clinical practice in the Pain Clinic, in order to determine longer -term response to MBBs, and assess for non -concordant responses, participants are provided with a pain diary and asked to rec ord NRS rating for typical low back pain intensity as done during the initial screening. x. Research staff will call the patient by telephone 2 -5 days after the 2nd set of MBBs. At this time, they will review ratings of low back pain intensity since the 2nd set of MBBs, referring to the clinical pain diary as needed. This information will be used to identify individuals with non - concordant responses to MBBs (for example, pain lasting >36 hours after a 2nd set of MBBs with bupiv acaine). xi. If a potential particip ant is identified after their MBBs have already been completed, or not approached at the usual time of an initial or final screening for another reason, we will send the participant an approach letter (Attachment ZZZ – Approach Letter ) and a FAQ document with information about the study ( Attachment ZZZ2 – Approach Letter FAQ ). These documents will prompt the Veteran to contact research study staff if they wish to hear more information about the study, or if he/she is not interested in the study. If we do not hear back from Veterans who are mailed the approach letter and FAQ within 4 business days, we will make attempts to contact the Veteran by telephone until a contact is made, leaving voicemail messages as needed. In instances where potential participant s are identified via approach letters in this manner, baseline study assessments can be completed as needed in in person in coordination with clinical appoi ntments or by telephone, or during in -person research assessments. C. Run-in period of Fitbit Use (between Visit 1 and Visit 2) The purpose of the run -in period is 1) to identify those participants who are able to use the Fitbit a minimum amount which we consider to be ‘Fitbit -compliant’, so that this variable can be adjusted for analytically , and 2) excl ude participants who fail Final Screening criteria or who are determined to be highly unlikely to be able to participate in study procedures (i.e. those who cannot be contacted by phone or in -person at least one time during the run -in period, indicating th at they would not be able to complete subsequent telephone questionnaires ). During the run -in period, research staff will be available to receive phone calls or visits from the participants so as to help them with any Fitbit related questions they h ave, or their ab ility to sync their data. Once it seems that a participant is able to use the Fitbit and sync it (which in many cases may be immediately after Visit 1), the research staff will begin a “test period” of 7 days. The earliest possible start of a test period w ould be the day after the randomization. If a participant has not synced their Fitbit by day 3 or 4 of the test period, they will receive a telephone call from research staff to offer help and answer questions, and to remind the participant to syn c the Fit bit. On days 5, 6, or 7, participants will receive up to one telephone contact/reminder and/or voicemail message left, in order to remind the participant to sync their Fitbit by the end of the 7th day after the start of the test period. If a life issue or barrier presents that interferes with ability to use the Fitbit unit, or the participant encounters a technological hurdle VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"
33,page_33,"VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Version 1.0: 04/2018 Page 34 of 55 of some type (such as device failure) the test period may be restarted at any time, and the process repeated. In addi tion, the test p eriod can be extended as needed due to holidays or absences (either for the participant or research staff) on an ad hoc basis. However, if a full test period elapses without the participant syncing their Fitbit, this would constitute a fail ure of the run -in period. i. Research staff will monitor the frequency of participant Fitbit use, and whether they are able to periodically upload their data. Participants who do not use their Fitbit, or do not upload data at least once during the run -in pe riod, w ill recei ve reminder phone calls. ii. Research staff will make telephone contacts as needed with participants to help participants learn how to use their Fitbits. iii. Participants who do wear their Fitbit unit on at least 3 of 7 days during the test period , for 6 hours at least each day during the participant’s regular waking hours will be classified as being ‘Fitbit -complaint’ . Participants who do NOT wear their Fitbit unit on at least 3 of 7 days during the test period, for 6 hours at least each day durin g the p articipan t’s regular waking hours will be classified as ‘non-Fitbit compliant’. iv. Participants who cannot be contacted at least once during the run-in period will be considered to have failed the run -period. They will be excluded from study particip ation a nd will n ot be randomized. D. Reassessment of study criteria on the day of randomization (Visit 2): i. Initial Screening Criteria will be repeated, as per Table 4 (but not including MBBs). Individuals who no longer meet screening criteria will not be ran domized and will not be followed further as part of the study. ii. Randomization will take place as described further below. iii. The lumbar procedure (LRFA or simulated LRFA) will be performed as per the processes described below. iv. Subjects will be given a 2nd study participation pledge form. This version of the pledge form will include the items listed on the 1st pledge form, without information pertinent to the run -in period, but will also include additional details that are specific to each participant’s CBT all ocation (AcTIVE - CBT vs. TBSCE). Specifically, the AcTIVE -CBT pledge form will encourage the participant to use their Fitbit, and try to gradually increase their daily walking while in the study (Attachment O – Pledge Visit 2 Extended ). As previously, subje cts will have a chance to read the pledge and ask questions, and confirm verbally that they understand the pledge and agree to its content. The participant can keep the pledge form. TBSCE participants will also read a pledge form (Attachment N – Pledge Vis it 2 Brief), which is the same as (Attachmen t O – Pledge Visit 2 Extended ), except it does not specifically encourage active Fitbit engagement, and recommends against using the Fitbit Group or Friend functions. v. At the time the 2nd study pledge form is provided by a research staff member , the staff member will will ask the “Post-procedure questions ”. These involve 1 -4 questions , which inquir e about the participant ’s immedia te impression of whether they received LRFA, or simulated LRFA. E. Approach Letters. i. In cer tain situations, po tential particip ants for SELECT may not be captured by the pre -screening and screening processes as described above. Therefore, they may be identified at some point after their 1st set of MBBs have been completed, but when they no longer have an upcoming c linical appointm ent scheduled when it is possible to approach them in person about the study. In some cases, this may occur between their 2nd set of MBBs and the time of their lumbar RFA procedure. For Veterans who meet this criteria an d are identified du ring th e screeni ng process, we will follow the steps below. ii. If potential Veteran participants are identified as above, the PI will send an encrypted email to the treating interventional spine provider for the potential participant , and/o r contact by telep hone.

34,page_34,"VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Version 1.0: 04/2018 Page 35 of 55 interv entional spine provider will 1) decide whether the Veteran appears to meet criteria for the study, and 2) approves research staff contacting the patient. Either the interventional spine provider will complete the Interven tional Provider Ch ecklist, or the PI will complete based on information from the interventional spine provider and/or the medical record. iii. If the Veteran is a potential participant and approved by the interventional spine provider, research staff will ma il an approach let ter. iv. If we do n ot receive an inquiry from a potential participant within 7 days after the letter was sent, research staff will begin attempts to contact the potential participant. We will leave voicemail messages as needed . If the Vetera n is reached, rese arch sta ff will talk to them at that time or arrange another time to do so, over the phone, or in person. That discussion can be scheduled around the time of an upcoming appointment at the Seattle campus, if convenient for Veteran. v. At the time arranged to talk, research staff will provide Veteran with basic information as you would at the initial contact (Visit 0). If a Veteran is not interested and wants to stop talking, staff will end the call. If a Veteran is interested, research staf f would proceed wi th the s creening checklist as typically done during a Visit 0. vi. If Veteran passes the screening checklist, we would mail him/her the same info he/she would normally get at a Visit 0 ( a What to Expect form [approach letter version ] and a blank consent) vii. If Veteran passes the screening checklist, research staff would try to arrange an in -person Visit 1 in order to complete study procedures and informed consent. Visit 1 would need to happen at least 2 days before the time when their LRFA is scheduled. Ideally this w ould be scheduled to coincide with another clinical visits or time when he/she is alrea dy coming to the medical center. We will inform Veterans that the Visit 1 would be for research , and that there is no “travel compensation” for this visit. However, ther e is st udy-related comp ensation for completing Visit 1 , including informed consent, as well as for our other study assessments. Visit 1 would otherwise take place exactly as described above , including distribution of Fitbits, and a ‘run -in perio d’ after v isit 1. The run -in requirement for Fitbit use can be waived for Veterans recruited via Approach Letter, if there is insufficient time between Visit 1 and Visit 2 for Fitbit wear and syncing. F. COVID-19 Pre -Screening Measures i. SELE CT staff will specifically inquire with the Pain Clinic physician treating a patient about whether the patient has active symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath, and/or is potentially at -risk for COVID -19, prior to interactions with a partici pant/potential participant. SELECT staff will not engage in face-to-face interactions with participants/potential participants if they are thought to have any of these symptoms or historical features by the Pain Clinic treating physician. In those cases, we m ay conduct screening by phone (for participa nts in t he study) or via our existing ‘approach letter’ pathway (for potential participants - which includes screening by phone). We will apply these procedures until there is further specific guidance from R&D ab out what to do in response to contacts poten tially i nvolving those at -risk for COVID -19, or until such screening is no longer needed. ii. SELECT staff will only approach patients if they feel comfortable doing so. Until COV ID-19 screening at VA P uget Sound is lifted, or until further guidance from R& D regarding patient contact , the Study Coordinator will serve as a back -up for all in -person contact visits , and will conduct in -person contact visits in li eu of any staff who wish to refrain from patient contact du ring this time . SELECT staff will reach out to the S tudy Coordinator directly if they wish to refrain from in -person contact. Patients who Decline : We will enter data for all pat ients scre ened in to the study database and assign a screening ID. The syste m will assign a screening ID for all screened patien ts, including those who are ineligible or eligible and refused to enroll. Research staff will collect basic demog raphic informati on using t he demo graphic information form from all patients who are deemed eligible to particip ate yet decline to participate. These data will be collected to VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"

If an eligible patient refuses to participate in the study, re search staff member will ask the patient about the reason for declining study participation and record it on the patient Screening Form . Patients who decline but meet eligibility cr iteria wil l conti nue usual clinical care in the VAPSHCS Pain Clinic for interventional spine procedures, including LRFA, as the y would normally do. Understanding the reasons why Veteran patients are not interested in study participation i s an essential s tep toward s makin g the research process acceptable to Veterans in the futur e. Patients who decline will be asked verbally wheth er they would be willing to answer up to 6 questions about why they are not interested in study participation. We will inform pat ients that any an swers they provide will be recorded without reference to a ny identifying information about them, so there woul d be no way to discern by looking at this information from what patient the information came from. Thus, this typ e of answering q uestions i s diffe rent than what would be in a research study, and we will a ssure the patient that answering these questions doe s not constitute participation in the study. We provide the script for these questions as Attachment QQ (‘Questio ns to Non - partic ipants’) Study p articipants will be compensated for their time spent compl eting the research procedures for this study, which include the time spent in the Informed Consent process, and completing the study assessments (in person or teleph one quest ionnaires ). They are not compen sated for the lumbar procedures (LRFA or simulated LRFA with targeted steroid injections) or CBT (AcTIV E-CBT or TBSCE) they receive during the 3 months of main study follow -up, since these are usual clinical care pro cesses appropriate for LRF A-eligible ind ividuals with chronic low back pain . Compensation w ill be made by checks mailed to participants. Paymen ts will happen a fter the study visit s on the day of randomization, the 3 -month follow -up, and again at the end of the optional period of mo re extended fo llow-up after 3 -months, unless participants express that they would wish instead to be paid monthly. Compensation will be by check, which will usually be mailed to participants within 4-8 weeks after completing each component . However, due to possible dela ys, participants will be told it could be up to 4 months after completing each component that they will receive payment. Compensation is as follows: • VISIT 1: Information session, inform ed consent, and pre -assessmen t ($ 35) • VISIT 2: The ‘b aseline’ study assessment, which involves completi ng questionnair es ($ 25) • VISIT 3: A questionnaire completed by te lephone ($ 10) • VISIT 4: A questionnaire completed by telephone ($ 10) • VISIT 5: A question naire completed by t elephone ($ 25) • Addition al compensation for completing all 3 sets of telephone assessment s ($ 15) • An ‘interim survey’ questionnaire that ma y be offered in the event that a participant elects a major change to the interventional spin e treatment or behav ioral treatment regimen pr ior to the expected earliest point of unblinding at the 3-month f ollow-up ($ 10) Optional study visits • VISITS 6 -14: If participant decide s to continue participation in this study after Visit 5, these are stu dy visits that will take place over the teleph one ($ 10 for each monthly telephone questionnaire ). We will clarify that optional study visits will not take place a fter the fo rmal end of the study , so some participants recruited late during the study will have fewer “optional ” study visits that they ca n comp lete. In sum, participants may be reimbursed up to $120 for completing all study assessments processes over 3 months. In addition, participants may be reimbursed up to a maximum of $30 -90 for optio nal study assessments betw een months 4 and 12 and an additional $10 if an ‘interim survey ’ is completed . 5.3 Informed Consent Procedures VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"
36,page_36,"VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Version 1.0: 04/2018 Page 37 of 55 A Waiver of Informed Consent was obtained to cover screenin g/recruitment procedures . Informed consent for study partici pation is as described bel ow. A. Informed Consent : We will obtain written c onsent from potential study participant s following the final screening, after completion of the 2nd set of MBBs. During Informed Consent, p otential RCT participants will: i. Receive basic information con cerning the overall study goals, which involve simul taneous randomization to 2 types of act ive treatment: procedural treatments that target the lumbar facet joints, and behavioral treatments bas ed on principles of CBT for chronic pain. ii. Receive detailed inf ormation concerning the st udy procedures; iii. Have the o pportunity to consider all available op tions for treatment of pain; iv. Receive adequate time t o raise questions and voice concerns; v. Be questioned to assure that they understand all information provided; vi. Provide written voluntary cons ent to participate in cont inued screening processes . B. Detailed Description of Informed Consent: In the section bel ow, all uses of the word ‘patients’ prior to comple tion and signing of the informed consent form (ICF) refers to potential candidates for s tudy participation beyond the Informed Consent. Please see the In formed Consent documents themselves. Patients will be informed during the consenting process that if t hey are determined to be fully eligi ble for the study and choo se to participate, they wi ll be randomized to LRFA o r a simulated LRFA procedure including targeted steroid injections to the facet nerves, and to two types of telehealth - administered behavioral treatments for pain (one brief, one extended). All treatments (both the procedural trea tments and behavioral trea tments) are “active” treatments expecte d to improve pain and/or pain -related functional lim itations, and all are standard of care treatments i n the US. Because in routine clinic al practice our experience has been that patients re ceiving invasive lumbar pain procedures such as LRFA and lumbar s teroid injections are often unclear of some specific s of these procedures and their risks , our informed consent document differs from typic al recommendations in that it enumerates the specifi c physical risks of these procedures, even though these involve t he same risks as performed in routine clinical care. We have chosen this route to ensure that participa nts are fully informed. However, if the IRB reviewers’ have fu rther questions or recomme nd that these risks of usu al care practices are omitted, we will be happy to provide further information and/or revis e accordingly. Study staff will describe that ra diofrequency ablation (LRFA) is a wi dely used therapy for reli eving low back pain, but t hat there remains debate a bout its effectiveness, whether other l ess invasive procedures may be equivalent (such as s teroid injections) and whether long -term negative s equelae from LRFA can involve the jo ints, adjacent muscles or intervertebral discs. Pati ents will be informed that there is some possibility that at leas t some of the pain -relieving effect of LRFA may not be due to the nerve destruction itself, but due to the local anesthesia used, the direc t mechanical effect of the needles/electrodes on the tissues in the back, nons pecific effects, or other things that w e do not know yet. Patients will also receive a desc ription of the targeted steroid injections that wil l be administered as part of the sim ulated LRFA control proced ure, and how these procedu res may have therapeutic effects, without possible long-term nega tive sequelae from nerve destruction (as in LRFA) involved joints, or adjacent muscles or intervertebra l discs. Patients will also be infor med that there is also VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"
37,page_37,"VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Version 1.0: 04/2018 Page 38 of 55 uncertainty about the true ef fectiveness of targeted st eroid injections, similar to the situat ion with LRFA effectiveness. The risks of the LRFA p rocedure will be discussed, including that it entai ls applying heat to a nerve that sup plies the facet joint (whi ch destroys the nerve at l east temporarily) and appl ying anesthetic around the nerve to the facet joint. Risks will be noted, including infecti on, bleeding, nerve damage, pain at the injection s ite, allergic reaction, and worsenin g of back pain. The risks of the simulated LRFA cont rol procedure with targete d steroid injections will also be discu ssed, which generally involve the same possible risk s as LRFA , but with a lower expected frequency of s uch risks since the nerves are not d estroyed. Patients will be informed that, if they me et all inclusion criteria and are ultimately randomized, they wil l have a 50% chance (1:1 randomization) that they wi ll not receive LRFA initially, but will receive sim ulated LRFA with targeted steroid in jections instead. Potentia l risks of enrolling in th e trial and being randomiz ed to the control procedure will be dis cussed, including the possibility that they may cont inue to experience back pain. Potential benefits of enrolling in the trial and being ra ndomized to the control pr ocedure will be discussed, including the possibility that the patient may have back pain im provement and avoid the need for LRFA, surgery or ot her interventions for pain and that closer follow -up than usual will be given. Study staff will also describe t o potential participants t hat many behavioral treatm ents for CLBP are available, and some ( such as CBT) have evidence of effectiveness. However , we don’t know what components of CBT -related trea tments create these positive effects . We will explain moreover that CBT, even video -base d CBT such as the AcTIVE -CBT intervention, consumes substantial V eteran time which may not result in any effects beyo nd those of the initial education, the provision of written materials, and the formal s tructure needed for a pati ent-directed graded, progr essive, education and self-management program. Therefore, this st udy involves comparing two programs of CBT which are delivered by telehealth methods, intended to make it easier for Veterans to access CBT , without the burdens of t ravel and transportation t o repeated face -to-face ap pointments. One program is an ‘extended CBT’ program, which involves a program requiring mo re appointments and video -based sessions with a psy chologist (ACTIVE -CBT) . The other pr ogram is a ‘brief CBT’ pro gram, which involves a sin gle telephone -based sessio n with a psychologist, and a structured program for education and for the patient to apply the concepts of CBT independently and at their own pace, using formal written materials , with subsequent check -ins by the psychologist as n eeded (TBSCE). Patients wi ll be informed that, if they meet all i nclusion criteria and are ultimately randomized, the y will also have a 50% chance (1:1 randomization) o f receiving one of these 2 treatment s. The extended CBT treatm ent (AcTIVE -CBT) will invo lve eight 1 -hour video ses sions with a psychologist and the provi sion of educational materials; and the brief CBT tre atment (TBSCE) will involve one 1 -hour telephone se ssion with a psychologist and the pr ovision of educational mat erials, with one follow -up phone call by the psychol ogists approximately 1 -2 months after t he 1st session of TBSCE, and focused troubleshooting with any problems that might arise. Both treatment s will involve the patient needing t o wear a Fitbit activity t racker daily for 3 months. However, the AcTIVE -CBT t reatment will involve specific therapy - related interactions surrounding the Fitbit unit . Participants in the AcTIVE -CBT group will be given a ‘pledge’ form which indicates their intent to try to upload th eir information to the Fit bit website regularly and consult their Fitbit regularly during t he study, to the extent that they are able (Attachme nt O – Pledge Visit 2 Extended). Participants in th e TBSCE group will be given a ‘pledg e’ form which indicates th eir intent to try to uploa d their information to the Fitbit website regularly, but will not include prompts for participants to consult their F itbit during the study, and will ask them not to spend time reviewing their information on the Fitbit website or using the Group or Friend functions , to the extent that they are able , during the first 3 m onths of the study (Attachment N – Pledge Visit 2 Br ief). At the conclusion of the study, unless partic ipants elect not to do so, participa nts will be provided with an official report contain ing their study data, incl uding their activity tracker data. Part icipants may keep the Fitbit unit/s that they use du ring the study, after study conclusion, irrespectiv e of their group assignment. VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"

Potential participants will c onsent either to data coll ection for 3 months only, or to also include an ongo ing data collection on a monthly basis after the 3 -month assessment, for up to 9 additional months, or until the funding period ends (whicheve r date comes first). Participants ma y change their mind about the duration of time they wish to participate in dat a collection at any time during the stu dy. Potential participants will be informed that, if they choose to participate in the study, they w ill remain blinded to which study in terventional procedure the y received (LRFA vs. simul ated LRFA) until 3 months. Pledge forms will ask participants to not actively seek out to find answers for which proc edural group they are in. At 3 months they will hav e the opportunity to become unblinde d if they wish, and make a ny usual health care decis ions related to CLBP that they wish at that time, with or without the input of their treating physician. This might i nclude having LRFA, irrespective of whether they ha d already received LRFA or simulated LRFA as part of this stud y. They will also be infor med that if they wish to b ecome unblinded at any time during the study (to seek treatment off protocol for example) o r discontinue enrollment in the trial, they can do so. Potential participants will also be told that at 3 months they can be informed about which of the 2 behavioral interventions (AcTIVE -CBT and TBSCE) constituted the official study ‘control’. At 3 months they will have the opportunity to become unblinded to this information if they wish, a nd make any usual health c are decisions related to C LBP that they wish at that time, with or without the input of the ir treating physician. This might include other beha vioral treatments including conventional in -person CBT, typical video -based telehealth as offered by the VAPSHCS TREWI program, or others, irrespective of whether th ey received the AcTIVE -CBT or TBSCE tre atment as part of this study. They will also be info rmed that if they wish to become unblinded at any t ime (and to pursue usual care outsid e of the study protocol) o r discontinue enrollment i n the trial, they will be allowed to do so at their discretion. The consent process will occur at a time deemed mutu ally feasible for the Veteran patient and staff mem ber and coord inated on a case -by-case basis. The consent proce ss will take place in a pr ivate location (e.g., a me dical exam room or private conference r oom). In most instances, this will take place in the Building 100 Room 7C -130A (in the Pain Clinic clin ical area). However, if Room 7C -130A is occupied, this will ta ke place in another unoccu pied patient room in the P ain Clinic clinical area, or in Room 7C -14. A research staff member (see Study Staff Form) will review each section of the IRB -approved ICF, inviting discussion to ensure compre hension. Potential partici pants will be asked to rep eat back understanding of this material as necessary. Individuals will not be permitted to participate if there is any question as to whether a person is able to provid e informed consent. Study staff will be trained to ensure comp etency to discuss informed consent and strategies to ensure there is no coercion. Potential participants will be provided with as much time as needed to review the ICF and ask the research staff member questions about the ICF, the ir rights as human partici pants, and participation i n the study. Potential par ticipants will be fully informed of all risks and benefits prior to giving their written informed consent and prior to enrollment in the study . To minimize the possibility of coe rcion or undue influence p rospective subjects will b e informed that their deci sion regarding involvement will in no w ay influence their clinical care and they will be as ked if they need some time to consider their involv ement before providing consent. All study personnel will have completed the necessary hu man subjects protections t raining per VA policy. Informed consent will be conducted in English.

See the Screening Checklist s (Attachment s L, RR, SS ). Study Measures The primary study outcome is the Roland -Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). We wil l also collect several secondary outcomes as described below. All the main study outcomes as described below are patient -reported outcomes (PROs), except fo r Fitbit Zip -assessed daily step counts. A schedule of when each study measure will be administe red is provided below in Table 5 . The Study Measures are contained in the study assessment s (Attachments, P, Q, R, and S). • Roland -Morris Disability Ques tionnaire (RMDQ): The R MDQ is a back pain specific functional status questionnaire adapted from the Sickness Impa ct Profile (SIP).3 The R MDQ consists of 24 yes/no items, which represent common dysfunctions in daily act ivities experienced by participants with low back pain. A single unweighted score is derived by summing the 24 items, with higher scores indicating worse function with 0 (no disability) to 24 (maximum disability). The RMDQ was designed for paper administra tion, and is also well -suited for telephone use. • Fitbit Zip -Assessed Daily Step Counts: Multiple recent studies have demonstrated the reliability and validity of the Fitbit Zip units as compared to actual observed step counts or legacy reference standard activity monitors such as the Modus Health StepWatch.4-6 • Pain Numerical Rating Scale (NRS): We will measu re back pain using a 0 -10 pain NRS (0=no pain and 10=worst pain imaginable) assessing average pain over the past week and pain “right now”. Numerical rating scales of pain intensity are valid, reliable, and sensitive to detecting change in pain intensity a fter treatment.7,8 We will also ask participants to make a second repor t of typical low back pain, and 2) onset of typical lumbar back pain relief within 30 mins, and relief lasting at least 30 mins after the onset of initial pain relief Depending on the distribution of r ecruited participants ’ MBB responses (50 -79% vs. ≥80%) after the initial period of recruitment, we may restrict study participation in the participant sele ction phase in order to oversample participants who have ≥80% reli ef with MBBs.

We will use the PROMIS Short Form 10, as recently recommended by an expert panel on the optimal core outcome measurement instruments for clinical trials in nonspecific low back pain (Chiarotto et al. Core outco me measurement instruments for clinical trials in nonspecific low back pain. Pain. 2018 Mar;159(3):481 -495.) • Physical Activity : Self -reported moderate and vigorous physical activities from the Behavioral Risk Factor and Surveillance System studies. • Glob al Perceived Effect: This is a 7 -point Likert scale describing change in disability since baseline and range s from “much worse” to “much better”.63-65 Participants will also assess their satisfaction with treatments received for LRFA, simulated LRFA, AcTIV E-CBT and TBSCE control . • Medications: Patients will report medications they have taken for pain in the pas t 3 days. • Adverse Events: Patients will report any adverse events they have experienced since the day of randomization/day of LRFA vs. simulated L RFA procedure. • Ad hoc AE reporting : Participants will be given instructions at the time of informed consen t to contact research staff by phone for AE reporting at any time, after the day of randomization/day of LRFA vs. simulated LRFA procedure. • Bang B linding Index: To assess success of participant blinding. A schedule of study assessments is provided in Table 5. Over the follow -up period lasting at least 3 months, the following study assessments will be performed at VA Puget Sound, or conducted by telephone, as described below: VISIT 1 (taking place at the time of the second MBBs) (60 -70 mins duration ) Study as sessments for Visit 1 will be conducted in person, coordinated to coincide with the timing of the participant’s 2nd set of MBBs, after the 2nd set of MBBs. Where this is infeasible, some or all of the Visit 1 study assessment will be conducted over th e pho ne, after the 2nd set of MBBs. Either in person or over the tel ephone, p articipants will answer questions (Attachment P – Survey Visit 1 ) including sociodemographic factors , the RMDQ, low back pain NRS, and medication use. If Visit 1 is conducted i n-person after the 2nd set of MBBs, research staff will also make a brief follow - up phone call at least 2 -5 days after the 2nd set of MBBs, to ascertain the duration of low back pain relief after the 2nd set of MBBs (Attachment L – Screening Checklist , que stion 21 ). This brief phone call will last <5 minutes. VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"

If a participant were to continue as part of this study, the monthly questionnaires would be the same as what the participant completed by telephone during phone Visits 3 -4, and would take bet ween 10 -15 minutes to complete. These optional assessmen ts (Attachment S – Survey Visits 6-14) are completely voluntary. If a participant initially decide s to complete the optional assessments, but later opt s to stop completing them, we will not offer the optional assessments again. Participants will be compens ated for completing each optional assessment . 3) If a participant spontaneously offers expresses that they are ambivalent about the options discussed in #1 an d #2 immediately above (unprompted by study staff), and requests more information, study staff will inform participants that remaining blinded to the treatments received for a longer period of time is more beneficial to meeting the study’s goals, as is participants’ continuing to complete the optional monthly assessments. Therefore, if a participant is truly ambivalent about the options discussed in #1 and #2 immediately above, remaining blinded and continuing with monthly assessments for as long as partici pants wish is the most useful course in terms of meeting the study’s goals. 4) We will clarify that opt ional study visits will not take place af ter the fo rmal end of the study , so some participants recruited late during the study will have fewer “optional ” study visits that they can comp lete. Participants will be i nformed that in this study , research staff will need to periodically look up participants’ information in the electronic health record. This will be so for the duration of this study, a period that ma y last up to several years. This includes looking up suc h information from participants’ health re cords after the 3 -month follow -up period, irrespective of whether participants have decided to complete the option al telephone questionnaires . If a participan t decide s to withdraw from this study, however, a nd inform s the research team not to access his/her health record after that time, we will not access that participant’s health record after that time. 5.6 Data Analysis This is a pilot study, and is not po wered to detect specific magnitude effects at the level of statistical significance. Instea d, the purpose of this study is to ascertain the magnitude of effects and relevant variability, so that a definitive large -scale future RCT can be conducted. Since the vast majority of CLBP patients at VAPSHCS hav e not received prior CBT, the number of patients receiving LRFA will be the limiting factor in recruitment. We intend to pre -screen all MBB procedures that are performed in the VAPSHCS Pain Clinic during the study period , to identify potential LRFA candida tes in advance. Based on current procedura l volume, we estimate that the VAPSHCS pain clinic will perform 800 LRFA procedures in 2019 and annually during the study period , and ≥40% of these procedures done a nnually (n~320) will be for individuals with ≥ 50% pain relief concordant with the expected duration of anesthetic effect from 2 sets of (comparative) MBBs. Based on past experience in the LESS RCT of epidural injections , we estimate that at least 18% of el igible participants (n=58) will meet other study criteria and be willing to be randomized annually during the study period. Of these, we aim to recruit up to for 30 Veterans for this study , and expect to lose up to 10 Veterans during the run -in period prio r to randomization, or during follow -up; our target goal is to have n=20 Veterans who will complete the run -in period, be randomized, and contribute 3 -month follow -up data for the primary outcome (the RMDQ), with a mini mum of 4 Veterans within each of the 4 cells of the 4x4 table (see VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"
46,page_46,"VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Version 1.0: 04/2018 Page 47 of 55 Figure 2). If the number of Veterans failing the run -in perio d, or lost to follow -up, is lower than expected, we may recruit fewer than 30 Veterans total during the course of this study. If the number of Veterans failing the r un-in period, or lost to follow -up, is higher than expected, we will request permission fro m the VAPSHCS IRB to recruit more than 30 Veterans total during the course of this study. The analysis will examine treatment groups for baseline imbalances in cov ariates, understanding that our small sample size will limit the ability to adjust analyses in subsequent steps. We will then conduct an intent -to-treat analysis. Given that this is a preliminary study, the analysis wil l focus on effect sizes rather than s tatistical significance. Analyses will be conducted by research staff members biostatistici an Dr. Ania Korpak and biostatistician Andrew Timmons at the Seattle ERIC. We will examine for ‘interactions’ between the effect of LRFA (vs. control) and that of Ac TIVE -CBT (vs. TBSCE control) on 3 -month RMDQ scores, using a 2 -way ANOVA. We will contrast the size of this estimate with that of the individual (‘main effects’) of LRFA vs. simulated LRFA ( Figure 2; groups A+C vs. B+D) and AcTIVE -CBT vs. TBSCE control (gr oups A+B vs. C+D). If the size of interaction effect is small relative to the main effects, the main effects will inform estimation of the sample sizes needed for a future adequately powered RCT of LRFA vs. simulated LR FA or AcTIVE -CBT vs. control. Seconda ry comparisons of cell D vs. cell C, and cell D vs. cell B, would inform sample size estima tion for a future RCT of combined treatment with LRFA + AcTIVE -CBT, compared to each of these treatments alone. If the size of i nteraction effect is large relative to the size of the main effects (making it inappropriate to study ‘main effects’), power cal culations for the future RCT will be based on the effect sizes yielded from comparisons of cell D vs. cell C, cell D vs. cell B, and cell D vs. cell A. We will follo w the same approach for other study outcomes. 5.7 Withdrawal of Subjects Participant with drawals We will record termination/withdrawal information for participants who decide to leave the study prior to completing the 3-month follow -up. Participants may leave th e study at their own discretion, by contacting the research team and notifying them of the decision to leave the study. If participants wish to become unblinded, research staff will inform them of their treatmen t allocations at the time participant s give notification of their decision to leave the study . Withdrawal from the study will no t affect care participants receive at VA facilities . Participants will continue to receive any VA care for back pain that they e lect to pursue, in coordination with their providers and VA clinical care processes. Participants may be withdrawn from the st udy without their consent if the y become incarcerated during the study, or if the researchers feel that the study is in some way negatively affect ing the participant ’s health or wellbeing. Participants may also be withdrawn from the study if they demonstr ate threatening behaviors or potentially harmful behaviors towards research study staff. Participants will be withdrawn from the study if they are unable to be conta cted and/or unable to complete study assessments for 3 consec utive month ly study assessment s. In this case, it i s assumed that they do not wish to co ntinue in the study, and furthe r contacts would be intrusive. Although not considered ‘withdrawal’ p er se , participants who are consented may be subsequently excluded prior to randomization, if th ey 1) are found to not meet inclu sion/exclusion criteria, or 2) fail the run -in period between Visits 1 and 2 (i.e. they cannot be reached by researc hers during the run-in period. These exclusions cannot t ake place after randomization. For the purposes of the Informed Consent form, to sim plify understanding for potential participants, we do not distinguish between VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"

Collection of safety information will also include an y ad hoc participant -initiated contacts with the study team, and follow - ups by study staff if tr acking the course of any potentia l complications. We will establish a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to oversee study safety data. The DMC is described further below. We will record any potential complications as adverse events (AEs), defined as any unto ward medical occurrence that may present during treatment , but which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. We will also record serious adverse events (SAEs). We will complete an AE adverse event s form for any AEs that occur d uring the course of this trial. W e will record each event as it happens (or as soon as it becomes known to study research team) and we will follow the AE in sub seque nt scheduled/completed monthly assessments until resolution, the end of the patient’s participation or study completion (whichever occurs first) . Study staff will report all AEs to the study PI within 1 business day of learning of the AE. Study staff will also report AEs to the appropriate clinical treating provider (the interventional spine phy sician for AEs possibly related t o medical issues or procedural issues, and the treating psychologist for AEs possibly related to mental health). Study staff will complete and send the AE CRF to the Study PI within 5 business days of learning of the AE. Th e study staff will be responsible for entering the AE data into the study database within 5 business days of learning of the AE. Study staff will review the com plete ness of the entered data and will report the AE to the IRB. AEs will be reported to the IRB at the time of continuing review s. If appropriate, AEs will be reported to the DMC (as described further below) . • The study team will notify the study PI abo ut an y SAEs that occur within 1 business day of learning of the SAE. The study PI will notify th e IRB within 5 business days of l earning about the SAE. The DMC will review SAEs at their scheduled meetings. All SAEs will be reviewed and clinically evaluated by the treating physician. Subsequent clinical evaluation and any further assessment, that may include laboratory or imaging tes ting as well as treatment , will be done per clinical standard s of care. • Any death that occurs to a subject during their partici patio n in the study is reportable to the IRB and the DMC . The notification to the DMC and the IRB will include a determination fr om the study PI as to the likelihood of a relationship to the study procedure. A. Definition of an Adverse Event, Anticipated Adve rse E vent and Serious Adverse Event An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence th at may present during treatment , but which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. It can therefore be any unfavorable and unintend ed ev ent (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated wit h research participation, whether or not related to research participation. Anticipated AEs/potential AEs are those which might reasonably be expected to occur from LRFA or simulated LRFA with targeted steroid injections . These might include, but are not necessarily limited to: • Pain treat ment -related: pain at the procedure site, increased pain in low back pain or nerve pain VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"
48,page_48,"VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Version 1.0: 04/2018 Page 49 of 55 • Neurological : paralysis, temporary weak ness or numbness in legs, dysesthesias or allodynia • Hypersensitivity reactions to the medication s used during the procedure (e.g. anesthetic, or sedative) : respiratory or cardiac reactions, seizures, allergic reaction, serious and occasional fatal hypersen sitivity (anaphylactic) reactions • Endocrine: short -term increases in blood glucose levels may oc cur with one -time administration of corticosteroid, in patients with diabetes • Infection • Cardiovascular: bleeding at the incision site, injury to blood vessels, clotting of veins • Vasovagal reaction, hypotension (low blood pressure) (these occur only intra -procedure or immediately after th e procedure) • Miscellaneous: Swelling and bruising at the incision site Anticipated AEs following prolonged fluoroscopy (X -ray) might include: hair loss, skin redness, and skin damage. A serious adverse event (SAE) is define d as any untoward medical occurre nce that: • Results in death • Is life -threatening (Note: the term life -threatening in the definition of “serious” refers to an e vent in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe). • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. • Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. • Results in congenital anomaly/birth def ect (if exposure to a medical pro duct prior to conception or during pregnancy may have resulted in an adverse outcome in the child). • Requires intervention to pr event permanent impairment or damage. • Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening or require hospi talization may be considered a SAE when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medi cal or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. In the proposed trial, the following events are considered SAEs: • Neurologic : paralysis, stroke, central nervous system infection • Serious hypersensitivity : anaphylac tic reactions • Death • An event that is life threatening , is permanently disabling , or requires inp atient hospitalization Severity of adverse event grading scale: • Mild: an experience that is usually transient, and requires no special treatment or interventio n • Moderate: an experience that is alleviated with simple therapeutic treatments • Severe: an exper ience that requires more than sim ple therapeutic interventions Relationship to research participation AEs: • Unrelated - This causal relationship is assigned when the AE is definitely not associated with the research participation/treatment • Unlikely - This c ausal relationship is assigned wh en there is no temporal relationship to the administration of the investigational material or other factors are more likely to have caused the VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"
49,page_49,"VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Version 1.0: 04/2018 Page 50 of 55 event. • Possibly related - This causal relationship is assigned when the AE start s at a reasonable time after stud y participation but could have been produced by the subject’s clinical state or other modes of therapy administered to the subj ect. • Probably related - This causal relationship is assigned when the adverse event starts at a reasonable time after study parti cipation, stops/improves when study participation/treatment has been stopped, and cannot be reasonably explained by known chara cteristics of the clinical state. • Definitely related - This causal relationship is assigned when the adverse event starts at a reasonable time after study participation/treatment, stops/improves when study participation/treatment has been stopped, can reas onabl y be explained by known characteristics of the study participation/treatment. B. Determinatio n of an Adverse Event AE identif ication We will monitor for adverse events during the entire duration of each patient’s participation, including all scheduled /compl eted monthly assessments and reporting offered by participants during unplanned contacts . In the proposed trial, there are t wo methods for AE identification: active and passive. Active identification Patient Reported: At scheduled study assessments, resea rch staff will inquire about medical/adverse events including surgery, ED visits, hospitali zations and ICU admissions, and a llergic reactions . When a patient reports any of the medical events listed above, study research staff will complete an Adverse Even t form ( Attachment V – Adverse Event Form ) and ask the patient details about the event. Su ch information will include, at a minimum, the date of the event, event seriousness, event treatment and event outcome. Assessments of AEs will include an open -ended question: “ Did you experience any other complications?” We will treat any response to thes e questions as if it is an AE unt il the study PI can further review and discuss it with the study team if needed . Passive identification Medical records review: We wi ll monitor medical records for SAEs at the time of scheduled assessments (monthly) until t he end of the 3-month data collec tion, or longer if a participant elects to continue with optional study assessments after 3 months . If we identify an SAE, the study coordinator will complete an AE CRF and inform the study PI. The list of SAEs to be checke d for monthly include: a major ne urologic event ( paralysis, stroke, central nervous system infection ), serious hypersensitivity/ anaphylactic reactions , death, a life -threatening or permanently disabling event, or one that requires inpatient hospitalizatio n. AE attribution and outcome The study PI will review all AEs to determine study relatedness and outcome of the event. If the PI is not available, AEs that ar e more pertinent to medical issues or procedures will be reviewed by Dr. Nishio or Soares, and A Es that are more pertinent to men tal health will be reviewed by Dr. Williams.

Other reporting We will complete an AE CRF for any AEs that occur during the main 3-mont h follow -up period of data collection. We will record each event as it happens (or as soon as it becomes known to study res earch team) and we will follow the AE at subsequent scheduled/completed monthly assessments , the end of the patient’s participa tion i n the study or study completion, or until directed by the participant’s treating provider (treating interventional spine pr ovider or treating psychologist) that the AE has resolved or further tracking is not needed (whichever of these occu rrences hap pens f irst). Study staff will report all AEs to the study PI within 24 hours of learning of the AE. Study staff will complete and send the AE CRF to the Study PI within 5 business days of learning of the AE. The study staff will be responsible for entering the A E data into the study database within 5 business days of learning of the AE. Study staff will review the completeness of th e entered data and based on the type of AE and requirements for the reporting AE (see below including UAPs), will report the AE to the DMC and/or IRB. Unanticipated problems (UAPs) are any problem that is 1) unexpected give n the research procedures and sub ject population, 2) related or possible related to participation in the research, and 3) that may have placed participants at a great er risk of harm than was previously recognized. Harm can be further classified as potentia l harm or actual harm. The study team and/or PI will report any UAPs to the IRB within 5 business days of learning about the AE that was later classified as a U AP. If serious, we will report this using the form "" Report of Unanticipated AND Related Serious Adverse Event (SAE), Unanticipat ed AND Related Adverse Device Effect (ADE), and/or Unanticipated AND Related Problem Involving Risk to Subjects or Others (UPIR TSO)"" (Attachment W – Serious Adverse Event Form) . UAPs encompass 'unexpected A Es' and are repor ted similarly. The DMC will revie w UAPs that are serious at their meetings. All AEs, UAPs, and SAEs will be clinically reviewed by a study physician (Drs. Suri, Nishi o, Soares , or Williams as described above ) and clinically evaluated and treated as needed, depending on the problem at hand . The study team will notify the study PI about any expected or unexpected SAEs that occur within 24 hours of learning of the SAE. T he study PI will notify the IRB within 5 business days of learning about the SAE. The DMC will review SAEs at their meeting s. All SAEs will be reviewed and clinically evaluated by the treating physician. Any death that occurs to a subject during th eir pa rticipation in the study is reportable to the IRB. The study PI will report the event to D MC, and to the study sponsor RR&D according to the timeframes of required reporti ng. The notification to the DMC and IRB will include a determination from the s tudy P I as to the likelihood of a relat ionship to the study procedure. D. Safety monitoring The DMC will review the accruing data to : 1) ensure that study conduct, enrollment, and patient follow - up is adequate; 2) ensure that there are no serious safety conce rns; a nd 3) assess evidence related to the study outcomes. The DMC will convene every 4 months d uring active recruitment, and in ad hoc meetings as needed. A report will be compiled for each DMC meeting that will outline study progress including recruitmen t, retention, protocol violations, AEs, SAEs, and unanticipated problems. In addition, the DMC members will be notified of individual S AEs on an on -going, real -time basis. DMC members will also be sent a “complete” safety and efficacy data report after the first 10 subjects have VA Puget Sound IRB Approved 03/12/2020"
51,page_51,"VA Puget Sound IRB Protocol Template – Version 1.0: 04/2018 Page 52 of 55 completed 3 -month follow -up, and at the end of data collection for the full expected sample size of 20 participants completing the main 3 -month follow -up outcomes . In these “complete” safety and efficacy data reports, we will use a Fisher ’s exact test to formally compare the event rates between ITT treatment groups and will qu alitatively compare to establishe d normative rates. Due to the number of statistical comparisons expected to be made, we do expect to see some differences of p< 0.05 f or some types of events, so we stress the qualitative nature of these comparisons. Based o n the currently published data, w e anticipate that AEs in the LRFA arm may be more common t han in the simulated RFA arm . If there is a qualitative difference in the p roportion of SAEs occurring between the study groups and there are concerns regarding the negative effects of the intervent ion, then the research team in consultation with both the study statistician and the DMC may recommend protocol changes or discontinu e the study. E. Withdrawal of subjects due to adverse effects We will maintain in the study participants who develop SAEs th at are study -related or not, as well as with severe or moderate study -related events (intention -to-treat), unless participants elect to withdraw from the study. 6.0 Privacy and Confidentiality The study will use participant s’ Protected Health Information (PHI ) for the purposes of participant payment by mailed check s to the participant’s current address. Also, PHI will be used to cont act pa rticipants via telephone (as outlined above ). PHI will be contained in the crosswalk file that links participant identifier s with the study -specific StudyID . No PHI will be disclosed as part of this study. We will take multiple steps to protect parti cipant s’ privacy, confidentiality, and inappropriate disclosure of data, under strict VA securit y guidelines. All study staff wil l maintain current on required VA trainings for privacy and confidentiality. Data will be stored in Participant Data Files that will be de-identified, labeled with a code number that is unique to each patient in the study (‘study -specific StudyID ’). The st udy-specific StudyID will b e a unique numerical code consecutively numbered in order of approach/screening. We will NOT include any p rotected health information (PHI) in the Participant Data Files. The Participant Data File s will be stored in a secure pass word -protected electronic location on the VA servers (expected to be the in the J: drive on the Health Services Research & Deve lopmen t (HSR&D) server) , accessible only to study staff members and authorized personnel. Staff will maintain a Master List key c ode that links participants with the study -specific StudyID . This Master List key code will be stored in a secure password -protected electronic location on the VA servers, separately from all other study data. All hard copy participant data will be stored in locked filing cabinets in the locked /secured offices of the Seattle ERIC , while all electronic data will be stored in passwo rd-protected files in a limited access folder (to research staff) on a secure VA network drive. Only IRB -approved study personnel will have access to Participant Data Files or Informed Consent Forms. We will only analyze data that does NOT contain PHI, and will report participant data in aggregate form only - no PHI will be entered into analyses or re ports. 7.0 Communication Plan This section is not applicable since this is a single -site study.

These will be retained for six years after study closure, unt il destroyed in acc ordance with VA procedures, and will not be moved from the ERIC , since there i s no need for movement of the documents . • Similarly, the electronic databases described above in section 7.0 will not be moved. These will be retained for six years after study c losure, at which time they w ill be destroyed in accordance with VA procedures. We will update the above plan a s needed if VA procedures and requirements change in the future. 9.0 References [1] Bair MJ, Ang D, Wu J, Outcalt SD, Sargen t C, Kempf C, Froman A, Schmid AA, Damush TM, Yu Z, Davis LW, Kroenke K.
