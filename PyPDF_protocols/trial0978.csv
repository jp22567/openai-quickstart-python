The ·.'-- terminal half-lives of apremilast in animals were short and ranged from 1 to 3 hours. The oral absorption of apremilast was high in mice and monkeys (� 70%). The oral bioavailability of apremilast was moderate (mouse and rat) to negligible (rabbit), suggesting that it is subject to first-pass extraction to varying degrees in animals. Notable gender differences were observed in rats, but not in mice and monkeys. When administered PO over a wide dose range, the exposure of apremilast increased in a less than dose-proportional manner, suggesting that apremilast absorption is solubility limited. On multiple dosing, a consistent trend of either decreasing or increasing exposures was not observed in mice and monkeys. The asymmetric center of apremilast was resistant to inversion in all the 4 animal models used for toxicity assessments. Apremilast was evaluated for photoxicity and showed no phototoxic or cytotoxic effect. \, __ Additional details as to the pharmacology of apremilast may be found in the Investigator's Brochure (see attached). 1.6. Clinical Experience As of 30 Nov 2015, apremilast had been administered at daily doses ranging from 10 to100 mg/day to over 5500 subjects in Celgene-sponsored studies, including over 4800 subjects who received apremilast in Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies in psoriasis, PsA, AS, ulcerative colitis (UC), AD, Behcet's disease (BD), or RA To date, 28 clinical studies have been completed, including 20 Phase 1 studies and 8 Phase 2 studies. A total of 15 clinical studies are currently ongoing: 4 Phase 2 studies (2 in subjects with psoriasis [including 1 pediatric study], 1 in subjects with AD, and 1 in subjects with UC), 10 Phase 3 studies (5 insubjects with PsA, 3 in subjects with psoriasis, 1 in subjects with BD, and 1 in subjects with AS), and 1 Phase 4 study (in subjects with psoriasis). A summary of all completed and ongoing Celgene-sponsored clinical studies with apremilast as of 30 Nov 2015 is presented. In addition, there have been 10 investigator-initiated trials (IITs) completed in subjects with AD, contact dermatitis, AS, cutaneous lupus, cutaneous sarcoidosis, lichen planus, osteoarthritis, prostatitis, vulvodynia, and rosacea. Additionally, 2 IIT studies (1 in plaque psoriasis and 1 in palmo-plantar psoriasis) are onging as of November 2015. 1.6.1. Phase 1 Apremilast Studies The clinical pharmacology program includes 20 completed studies. In these studies, 716 healthy subjects were exposed to apremilast and 16 subjects with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, 8 subjects with severe renal impairment, 16 subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment, and 15 subjects with PsA or RA were exposed to apremilast. Single doses of apremilast over the dose range of 10 to 80 mg and multiple doses of up to 100 mg/day have been evaluated in Phase 1 studies. The PK of apremilast in healthy subjects under fasting conditions is characterized by rapid absorption, with Cmax occurring at a median time to maximum concentration (tmax ) of approximately 2.5 hours post-dose and an average absolute bioavailability of approximately 73%.

Adverse Events A treatment-eme rgent adverse event (TEAE) is any AE either reported for the first time or worsening of a pre-existing event after first dose of study drug. Analysis of AEs will be limited to TEAEs, but data listings will include all AEs regardless of their timing to study drug administration. The subset of AEs considered by the investigator to have a relationship to study drug will be considered to be treatment-related AEs. If the investigator does not specify the relationship of the AE to study drug, the AE will be considered treatment-related. The incidence of AEs and treatment-related AEs will be tabulated. 9.4.2.2. Clinical Laboratory Tests Laboratory test values outside the normal range will be assessed for severity based on the normal ranges for the clinical reference laboratory. The incidence of abnormal laboratory values and shift tables relative to baseline will be tabulated. 9.4.2.3. Vital Signs Descriptive statistics and mean change from baseline will be determined for vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and body temperature) at each assessment time. Electrocardiograms 9.4.3. RNA seq Analysis Skin gene expression signatures will be performed at baseline and Week 12 to identify RNA signatures associated with treatment response. 10. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES 10.1. Investigator Responsibilities This study will be performed in accordance with ethical principles that originate in the Declaration of Helsinki and conducted in adherence to the study Protocol; GCPs as defined in Title 21 of the US CFR Parts 11, 50, 54, 56, and 312; ICH E6 GCP consolidated guidelines; and local regulatory requirements as applicable to the study locations.
