Eligible p atients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to :  Fitusiran treatment arm : Fitusiran 80 mg administered subcutaneously ( SC) as prophylaxis once monthly , with use of on-demand factor concentrate s for treatment of breakthrough bleeding episodes  On-demand arm : On-demand factor concentrate s for treatment of breakthrough bleeding episodes On-demand use of factor concentrates is defined as the use of these agents , as needed , for episodic bleeding, and not on a regular regimen intended to prevent spontaneous bleeding. Throughout the study, patients in the fitusiran treatment arm may receive on -demand treatment for breakthrough bleeding episodes with factor concentrates, as ap propriate. Bleed ing events and doses of factor concentrates administered during the conduct of the study will be recorded in an e lectronic Diary (eDiary) . Safety, quality of life, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacokinetic data will also be collected. All patie nts will be treated for a total of 9 months; patients randomized to the fitusiran treatment arm will receive a total of 9 SC injections of fitusiran. Because the full PD effect of fitusiran is not achieved until approximately 28 days after receiving the f irst dose, efficacy will be assessed during the remaining 8 months on study (Day 29 to Month 9) . An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will oversee the safety and overall conduct of this study. The DMC will perform periodic reviews of data durin g the course of the clinical trial, and on an ad hoc basis for review of emergent safety data, as defined in the DMC Charter for this clinical trial. Patients from both the fitusiran and on -demand treatment arms who complete the study may be eligible for p articipation in an open -label extension study. Following final fitusiran dose, for patients in the fitusiran treatment arm patients who do not enroll in the extension study, AT activity level will be monitored at monthly intervals until returning to an act ivity level of approximately 60% ( per the central laboratory ) or per Investigator discretion in consultation with the study Medical Monitor . Number of Planned Patients Approximately 120 patients will be randomized , including approximately 26 patients with hemophilia B and approximately 10 adolescents (≥12 to < 18 years of age ).

Diagnosis of severe hemophilia A or B will be ba sed on a central laboratory measurement or documented medical record evidence of FVIII level <1% or FIX level ≤2%. Investigational Product, Dose and Mode of Administration Fitusiran is an SC administered N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc )-conjugated siRNA tar geting liver - expressed messenger RNA (mRNA) for AT . Patients randomized to the fitusiran treatment arm will receive open -label fitusiran 80 mg as an SC injection once monthly for a total of 9 months; dosing will begin on Day 1 of the treatment period . Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration Patients in the on -demand arm will receive on -demand factor concentrate therapy per Investigator discretion to treat bleeding episodes from Day 1 through end of study. The protocol will recommend guidance for pati ents in the fitusiran treatment arm to use reduced initial doses of factor concentrates for breakthrough bleeding episodes during the fitusiran efficacy period. Duration of Treatment The duration of treatment with fitusiran is 9 months. The estimated total time on study, inclusive of screening, for each patient is up to 11 months for all patients who enroll in the extension study and patients in the on -demand arm who do not enroll in t he extension study . The estimated total time on study may be up to 17 months in fitusiran treatment arm patients who do not enroll in the extension study due to the requirement for an additional 6 months of follow -up for monitoring of AT levels. Statisti cal Methods Sample Size Calculation Assuming a mean ABR of 18 with standard deviation (SD) = 14 in the on -demand arm (patients randomized to receive only factor concentrates ) and a mean ABR of no more than 4 with SD = 6 in the fitusiran treatment arm (patients randomized to receive fitusiran) in either the efficacy period or treatment period , with a sample size of 32 evaluable patients in the on -demand arm and approximately 64 evaluable patients in the fitusiran treatment arm , it is projected that the study will have greater than 90% power for detecting treatment difference in mean ABRs. This power estimation was based on a negative binomial regression model with a 2 -sided type I error rate of 0.05. The planned sample size is 120 randomized patients assuming a 20% drop -out rate . Analyses The primary analysis will be performed on the intent -to-treat ( ITT) analysis set which includes all randomized patients. The primary endpoint will be based on the bleeding episodes occurring in the efficacy period (D ay 29 to Day 246 ) including the data collected after discontinuation of investigational medicinal product (IMP) . To avoid confounding the treatment effect, bleed ing data during and after major surgery, antithrombin (AT) administration, major trauma , or after initiation of prophylaxis treatment with factor concentrates will be excluded from the primary analysis. The number of bleeding episodes will be analyzed using a negative binomial model with fixed effects of treatment arm , the number of bleeding episodes in the 6 months prior to study entry (≤10 vs >10) , and hemophilia type (hemophilia A or B) . The logarithm number of days that each patient spends in the efficacy period matching the bleed ing episode data being analyzed will be included as an offs et (electronic 1.0)"

INTRODUCTION 1.1. Disease Overview Hemophilia A and hemophilia B are X-linked recessive inherited bleeding disorders, characterized by deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX), leading to a profound defect of thrombin generation with impaired hemostasis and increased risk of bleeding. Hemophilia A is found in approximately 1 in 5000 males whereas hemophilia B is five times less common and seen in approximately 1 in 25,000 males.[ 1] The disease affects all ethnicities and the mutation re sponsible for hemophilia is typically inherited from a carrier parent, although spontaneous mutations are responsible for ~30% of all cases. [1] The disease phenotype presents similarly in hemophilia A and B. [2] Hemophilia is classified as mi ld (factor levels 6% to 30%), moderate (factor levels 1% to 5%), or severe (factor levels <1%) based on clot ting factor activity relative to normal (healthy, non-hemophiliac plasma levels of factor are 50% to 150%). Patients with mild hemophilia typically experience bleeding after a serious injury or surgery; patients with moderate hemophilia experience bleeding episodes associated with injuries, and may have spontaneous bleeding episodes; severe hemophilia patients experience substantial bleeding with injury and may have frequent spontaneous bleeding episodes resulting in debilitating musculoskeletal damage that can markedly impair a patient’s mobility and quality of life (QOL). The hemostatic system aims to maintain the integrity of the vasculature by protecting against bleeding from vessel lesions combined with multiple options to prevent thrombosis. This hemostati c balance is achieved through an orchestrated regulation of both procoagulant (eg, factor V [FV], factor VII [FVII], FVIII, FIX, factor X [FX]) and anticoagulant (eg, antithrombin (AT), protein C/protein S and tissue factor pathway inhibitor) factors. Recent studies have suggested tha t coinheritance of a deficiency in natural anticoagulants may contribute to a milder phenotype in patients with hemophilia. Antithrombin is a liver-expressed natural anticoagulan t that plays a key role in inhibiting thrombin. Furthermore, AT acts as an inhibitor of FVIIa and FXa, which are typically at normal levels in patients with hemophilia A or B. Extensive preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies have described reduction of AT as a potential safe and effective way to correct thrombin generation in both hemophilia A and B and control against microvascular and macrovascular traumatic bleeding episodes.[ 3] Therefore, suppression of AT pr oducti on is being investigated as a potential hemophilia treatment. Replacement with factor concentrates is the current standard of care for hemophilia patients without inhibitory antibodies to FVIII or FIX. While the current standard of care of factor substitution therapy, administered either episodically or as routine prophylaxis, is well established, safe, and efficacious, it is associated with high treatment burden due to requiring intravenous (IV) administration on a frequent schedule (2 to 3 times per week or more) to prophylactically maintain hemostasis. [2] Factor concentrates also can be of limited availability in deve loping nations. In addition, patients receiving factor concentrates may develop an inhibitory antibody to factor, a result that carries a poorer prognosis and requires a change in treatment regimen to infusion with bypassing agents (BPAs).

Fitusiran is being developed to address these needs of patients with hemophilia. 1.2. Fitusiran (SAR439774) Fitusiran (SAR439774 [formerly Alnylam ALN-AT3SC]) is an investigational agent comprising a synthetic siRNA covalently linked to a triantennary N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) ligand, designed to supp ress liver production of AT as a strategy to rebalance the hemostatic system, thereby improving thrombin generation and hemostasis in individuals with hemophilia. Fitusiran is a Ga lNAc-siRNA conjugate that reduces production of AT, leading to lower plasma AT levels. By reducing plasma AT, fitusiran is designed to improve thrombin generation and hemostasis in individuals with hemophilia, regardless of hemophilia type or presence of inhibitory antibodies to factor VIII or IX. Because of the durability of the PD effect of fitusiran demonstrated in previous nonclinical and clinical studies, the subcutaneous (SC) administration required is notably less frequent (once monthly) than current IV standard of care with factor concentrates or BPAs (as frequent as every other day in severe cases), representing potentially improved quality of life and lowered treatment burden for patients with hemophilia. Further, with the durable PD effect, it is possible that fitusiran may maintain a patient at a more consistent, robust hemostasis than intermittent factor or BPAs. Fitusiran is being developed for the indication of routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitory antibodies to FVIII or FIX. 1.2.1. S ummary of Nonclinical Data With Fitusiran Nonclinical pharmacology and exploratory toxicity studies have been conducted in wild-type (WT) and hemophi lia mouse models, as well as WT rats, WT dogs, hemophilic dogs, and WT non-human primates (NHP). The fitusiran siRNA sequence is homologous across all tested spec ies; therefore, across multiple studies (single and repeat-dose), fitusiran exhibits potent and dose-dependent pharmacologic activity, resulting in reduced tissue AT mRNA levels and subsequent reduced circulating AT protein and activity levels, with a single-dose ED50 of ~1 mg/kg in multiple species. Exploratory pharmacology studies have also been completed in the he mophilia A dog and in an NHP induced hemophilia model. A GLP-compliant SC safety pharmacology study in NHP was conducted and there were no e ffects on measured cardiovascular or respiratory parameters after a single SC dose at any dose, with a NOEL for cardiovascular effects of (highest dose evaluated). There were no neurological effects in the GLP 39-week NHP study with a NOEL of (highest dose evaluated with repeat dosing). The pharmacology studies are summarized in greater detail in the Investigator’s Brochure. Plasma PK and toxicokinetic studies of single and repeated IV and/or SC doses of fitusiran were conducted in rats, dogs, and monkeys, and of fitusiran in mice. Following S C administration, fitusiran was rapidly absorbed following IV and SC administrati ons of in mice with Cmax occurring within 30 minutes of dose (electronic 1.0)"

There were no gender-related differenc es in the PK properties of fitusiran. After repeat dosing, the plasma PK profiles were similar after first and last dose indicating no time dependent changes in the PK of fitusiran. I n the in vitro studies of rats and NHPs fitusiran did not cause induction of the common P450 isoforms and was not a substrate for the common cytochrome P450 (CYP P450) isoforms. Genetic toxicity studies (bacterial reverse mutation, mammalian chromosome aberration, rat micronucleus test) have been completed, and demonstrated that fitusiran is non-genotoxic. GLP toxicology (7 weekly doses) studies were conducted with fitusiran in the rat and NHP. A chronic 26-week study in the rat and a 39-week study in NHP have been completed. The no observed a dverse effect level (NOAEL) in the 7-week rat toxicology study was , and in the 26-week rat toxicology study was . The NOAEL in the 7-week NHP study was , a nd the NOAEL in the chronic NHP study was . The NOAELs in all studies were b ased on toxicity attributable to the exaggerated on-target, pro-coagulant pharmacology of fitusiran that is expected in wild type animals (hemorrhage and/or thrombosis in various tissues, which led to mortality above a threshold of approximately ). By contrast, in exploratory studies, highly exaggerated doses of fitusiran (exposures in 100-fold excess of therapeutic relevance; >95% reduction in AT) were well tolerated in hemophilia A and B mice, with no evidence of toxicity or thrombosis. A 26-week GLP chronic toxicity in the hemophilia A mouse model was conducted. The top dose of was well tolerated for 26 weeks, indicating that hemophilic animals are not predisposed to pro-thrombotic effects compared to WT animals; a survival benefit was demonstrated in animals dosed with fitusiran vs saline controls (40% mortality in saline control vs 6% in fitusiran treated groups [p<0.0001 by Log-Rank test]). In addition, 6 month TgRasH2 mouse and 2-year rat carcinogenicity studies are currently ongoing. In the GLP-compliant 39-week chronic NHP toxicology study, administration of fitusiran by once weekl y SC injection to peripubertal cynomolgus monkeys at doses of , was well tolerated (approximately 70% chronic AT suppression at ). Based on the absence of fitusiran related effects on the toxicology parameters evaluated a t all dose levels tested, the NOAEL was considered to be . There was no effect of fitusiran on male reproduction in the rat and with repeat dose administration of fitusiran to juvenile rats and sexually immature cynomolgus monkeys, growth and maturation were unaffected. Overall, fitusiran was well tolerated locally, and non-genotoxic. Fitusiran does not activate the immune system. Taken together, the results from the nonclinical studies exhibit reduction in AT activity level, increase in thrombin generation, and corrective effect on hemostasis, thereby validating the therapeutic approach of the clinical studies.

The study was conducted in 4 part s:  P art A (N=4): randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blind single ascending dose (SAD) phase in he althy subjects (0.03 mg/kg SC single dose)  P art B (N=12): open-label, multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase in patients with moderate to severe hemophilia A or B without inhibitors (0.015 to 0.075 mg/kg SC once weekly )  P art C (N=18): open-label, exploratory multiple dose (MD) phase in patients with moderate to severe hemophilia A or B without inhibitors (0.225 to 1.8 mg/kg or 80 mg fixed dose SC once monthly)  Part D (N=17): open-label MD phase in patients with moderate to severe hemophilia A or B with inhibitors (50 or 80 mg fixed dose SC once monthly) Study ALN-AT3SC-001 was completed on 20 July 2017 (last patient last visit). Study ALN-AT3SC-002 is a Phase 1/2 multicenter, multinational, open-label extension study to evaluate the lon g-term safety and efficacy of fitusiran in male patients with moderate or severe hemophilia A or B, with or without inhibitors, who previously tolerated dosing in Study ALN- AT3SC- 001. Study ALN-AT3SC-002 is currently ongoing. A total of 34 patients who previously participated in Study ALN-AT3SC-001 and received at least 1 dose of SC fitusiran ranging from 0.225 to 1.8 mg/kg or 50 mg or 80 mg fixed doses have enrolled in the extension study. These 34 patients include 19 non-inhibitor patients (14 with hemophilia A and 5 with hemophilia B) and 15 inhibitor patients (13 with hemophilia A and 2 with hemophilia B). Three patients began the extension study on weight-based doses (0.225, 0.9 or 1.8 mg/kg) reflecting their original Phase 1 dose. All patients were transitioned to either 50 mg monthly (N=13) or 80 mg monthly (N=21) after no more than 4 doses. Patients are currently receiving either 50 mg (N =13) or 80 mg (N=21) fixed doses in this extension study, which is ongoing. For a more complete summary and the most recent available pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, safety, and efficacy data see the Investigator’s Brochure. 1.2.2.1. Sum mary of Efficacy Preliminary efficacy for pooled ALN-AT3SC-001 and ALN-AT3SC-002 data include analysis of annualiz ed bleeding rate (ABR ). For the purpose of ABR calculation, fitusiran “Onset Period” and an “Efficacy Period” were defined. The Onset Period was defined as the first 28 days after the first dose of f itusiran, during which the target pharmacodynamic effect is reached. The Efficacy Period, during which bleeds were counted for the purpose of ABR calculation, was defined as starting on Day 29. For patients who did not have an interruption in treatment >56 days between the Phase 1 study (ALN-AT3SC-001) and this Phase 1/2 extension study (A LN- AT3SC-002), bleed data from ALN-AT3SC-001 were included and the Efficacy Period was defined as starting on Day 29 of that study. As of 8 August 2017, 33 of 34 patients enrolled in the ex tension study met criteria for inclusion in this analysis, with one patient not yet having completed 28 days on study. Patients entering the extension study all received fitusiran as a once monthly injection. Initial doses ranged from 0.225 mg/kg to 1.8 mg/kg in 3 patients, but all patients were transitioned to (electronic 1.0)"

No prophylactic use of factor concentrates or BPAs were allowed after the first dose of fitusiran, with only on-demand use of these agents for the treatment of any breakthrough bleeding events. The ABR was determined for non-inhibitor and inhibitor patients receiving 50 mg or 80 mg. The prestudy ABR was reported at ALN-AT3SC-001 study entry, prior to beginning treatment with fitusiran. The ABR of patients from combined data from studies ALN-AT3SC-001 and ALN-AT3SC-002 reflects efficacy across hemophilia subtypes in both inhibitor and non-inhibitor patients. In patients on 80 mg monthly, the dose selected for Phase 3 studies, the media n ABR during the Efficacy Period (Day 29 to the data cut-off [8 August 2017]) is 1.46 and 0 in non-inhibitor (N=9) and inhibitor (N=11) patients, respectively. The median ABR on 50 mg monthly was 1.57 for non-inhibitor (N=10) and 6.84 for inhibitor (N=3) patients. All of the non-inhibitor patients on prophylactic therapy (N=7) pre-study either maintained low ABR, or de monstrated improved ABR on fitusiran, and the median ABR for this group was 1.7. A complete summary of available clinical efficacy data relevant to fitusiran is presented in the Investigator’s Brochure. 1.2.2.2. Summary of Safety As of 31 August 20 17, 42 male patients with severe or moderate hemophilia A or B, with or without inhibitors, have received fitusiran in clinical studies. Single and multiple doses of fitusiran ha ve been generally well tolerated. Most patients have reported at least 1 AE, the majority of which were assessed as mild or moderate in intensity and unrelated to investigational medicinal product (IMP). The most common AEs reported were injection site reactions, which were all mild and generally transient. Elevations of liver transaminases occurred in 13 of 42 patients dosed with fitusiran. None of the liver tr ansaminase elevations were associated with elevations of total serum bilirubin >2 × the uppe r limit of normal (ULN). Except in one patient, these elevations were asymptomatic, and occur red in patients with a documented history of prior HCV infection. Eleven of 42 patients reported a total of 14 SAEs. Out of these, 3 SAEs (elevated alanine aminotransfe rase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST], seizures, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis [ CVST]) were assessed as possibly related to fitusiran. Two patients discontinued fitusiran due to AEs (1 due to a non-serious AE of non-cardiac chest pain and another due to SAEs of elevated ALT and AST. One death has been reported in a patient with CVST in ALN-AT3SC-002, which was considered possi bly related to fitusiran. This occurred in a 27-year old patient who had been on study for 15 months. The patient was hospitalized for headache several days after treating hip pain with 31 IU/kg to 46 IU/kg factor VIII. While the patient was initially suspected of having viral mening itis, he was subsequently diagnosed with subarachnoid hemorrhage on the basis of computed tomography (CT) imaging, and treated with full dose Factor VIII concentrate two to three times daily. Over a 14-day hospitalization, the patient’s medical condition worsened despite the administration of FVIII concentrate and he died from subsequent cerebral edema. Post mortem review of images by independent neuro-radiologists confirmed that the initiating event was a CVST, and not a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The event is thus categorized as possibly related to fitusiran. No other thromboembolic events have been observed. (electronic 1.0)"

No consistent dose re lationship or clear difference between the 50 mg and 80 mg dose groups was observed with respect to incidence of AE s, SAEs or laboratory tests. A mor e detailed summary of clinical safety data is presented in the Investigator’s Brochure. 1.2.2.3. Summary of Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Effects in ALN-AT3SC-001 and ALN-AT3SC-002 Consistent with the inten ded pharmacological effects, regardless of inhibitor status, fitusiran dose-related reductions in AT activity level have been observed in the clinical studies, and have been associated with increased thrombin generation. In Part C of the Phase 1 study, the mean maximum AT activity level reductions following 3 monthly doses of 0.225, 0.45, 0.9 or 1.8 mg/kg fitusiran were 70% (N=3), 77% (N=3), 77% (N=3), and 89% (N=3), respectively. A fixed dose, 80 mg fitusiran, was also explored in Part C, resulting in a mean maximum AT activity level reduction of 87% (N=6). In Part D of the study, patients with inhibitors were dosed with 50 or 80 mg fitusiran and experienced mean maximum AT activity level reduction of 82% (N=6) and 87% (N=11), respectively. AT reduction was maintained in ALN-AT3SC-002, with mean maxim al AT reduction of 83.6% for 50 mg (N=13) and 85.9% for 80 mg (N=21) as of 08 August 2017. C onsistent with the therapeutic hypothesis, increased AT lowering in patients with hemophilia resulted in increased thrombin generation when AT lowering was in the highest quartile (>75%) compared to when AT lowering was in the lowest quartile (<25%). Further, the peak thrombin generation values achieved with AT lowering of >75% were comparable to those in the lower end of the normal range observed in healthy individuals. None of the thrombin generation measurements following >75% AT reduction in hemophilia patients exceeded those seen in healthy males. 1.3. Study Design Rationale The ATLAS-A/B trial (ALN-AT3SC-004 [ Sanofi Genzyme EFC14769]) is a multicenter, multina tional, randomized, op en-label Phase 3 study designed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of fitusiran in patients with hemophilia A or B without inhibitory antibodies to FVIII or FIX who are currently treated with on-demand factor concentrates. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of fitusiran on prevention or reduction of bleeding episodes. Secondary objectives are to assess the efficacy of fitusiran on: the number and type of bleeding episodes; HRQOL; and to determine the safety and tolerability of fitusiran. Blinding is not considered feasible for this study since the differences in treatment for each study arm cannot be blinded. The open-label, randomized study design is justified because safety monitoring of theoretical risks such as transaminitis or thrombosis can be objectively verified by laboratory monitoring or objective visualization, eg, ultrasound or CT. Therefore, the safety monitoring of the studied population does not require blinding. The primary endpoint of the study is ABR in the fitusiran efficacy period (Day 29 to EOS). ABR is a we ll-established endpoint that has been used as the primary endpoint in global approvals of factor replacement and BPA products. Secondary endpoints characterize ABR in the trea tment period, annualized spontaneous and joint bleeding rates, change in Hemophi lia (electronic 1.0)"

Characterization of bleeding episodes is clinically relevant to assess overall bleeding episode protection. Joint bleeding episodes result in pain and hemarthrosis, leading to progressive joint destruction, and hence are important to assess. The Haem-A-QOL is a hemophilia-specific HRQO L survey instrument that has been validated in other hemophilia clinical trials and is c onsidere d the most appropriate HRQOL tool for this study. The study population wil l be comprised of males ≥12 years of age; it is appropriate to study fitusiran in adolescents (patients ≥12 to <18 years of age) because the pathophysiology of disease progression a nd bleeding episode management is the same as adults and self-management of hemophili a typically begins at 12 years of age.[ 4] A similar study in hemophilia patients with inhi bitors (ALN-AT3SC-003) is being conducted concurrently to this study. To protect against bias, patients will be assigned to fitusiran (fitusiran treatment arm; N=80) or on-demand factor concentrate therapy (on-demand arm; N= 40) by stratified randomization. The onset period duration reflects modeling data that estimates it takes approximately 28 days to reach the therapeutic target range in the majority of patients. Efficacy of fitusiran will be assessed over the remaining 8 months of the study (Day 29 to Month 9). In the eve nt of a breakthrough bleeding episode, on-demand use of factor concentrates will be permitted throughout the entire study duration (see Section 6.3.1). 1.4. D os e Rationale Dose selection was guided by the principle of identifying an optimal dose that is both well- tol erated and efficacious. The fitusiran dose proposed for Phase 3 development was identified using both observed data from ongoing clinical studies, as well as extensive clinical simulations and modeling. The key PD and clinical parameters used to support the dose selection include decreases in AT activity, the most proximate and direct PD effect of fitusiran, as well as increases in thrombin generation and decreases in ABR. Observed data from Phase 1 and Phase 1/2 studies in patients with hemophilia A and B with o r without inhibitor s, and PK/PD-modeled data, support selection of a fixed dose of 80 mg for this study, a s subcutaneously administered once-monthly. In observed data from Phase 1 and Phase 1/2 studies, monthly equivalent doses or monthly doses ranging from 0.045 mg/kg to 1.8 mg/kg and fixed doses of 50 mg and 80 mg have been evaluated. A clear dose response trend of increased AT lowering is evident, with approximately 10% to 20% residual AT activity at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg and at fixed doses of 50 mg and 80 mg subcutaneously administered once monthly. These data suggest that the maximum AT lowering achieved as a function of the dose administered reaches an asymptote at ~90% AT lowering and that it is unlikely higher doses will achieve meaningfully greater AT lowering. In addition, both the 50 mg and 80 mg fixed doses produced substantial increases in peak thrombin generation, which approach the lower end of the normal range, but do not exceed the normal range. Dose-response modeling analyses are supportive of the observed data. A repeated time to event model was used to evaluate the relationship between AT lowering and the anticipated ABR. According to the model, the 80 mg, fixed, once-monthly dose is anticipated to result in near (electronic 1.0)"

Weight was not a significant covariate in the model, suggesting no advantage to weight-based dosing. The safety of fitusiran has been evaluated in healthy volunteers and patients with moderate to severe hemophilia A and in patients with moderate to severe hemophilia B in the ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 1/2 studies, and overall supports monthly administration of the 80 mg dose in this stud y. Full details of the safety findings from the Phase 1 and Phase 1/2 studies are presented in the Investigator’s Brochure. 1.5. Benefit-Risk Assessment Based on the available clinical data (see Section 1.2.2 ), fitusiran administered subcutaneously as a once -monthly fixed-dose regimen, may be able to offer potentially reduced bleeding rates for patients re ceiving factor concentrate or BPA treatment prophylactically or on-demand. Further, the pharmac odynamic profile of fitusiran results in consistent reduction of AT and therefore may provide more consistent increase in thrombin generation and hemostatic protection throughout the dosing interval. The clinical experience to date suggests that in hemophilia A or B patients, with or without inhibitors, fitusiran treatment is associated with reductions in AT, increases in thrombin generation, and reduction of the number of bleeding episodes. Given the mechanism of action of fitusiran, mode of administration, and available safety data, the possible risks associated with the use of fitusiran include thrombosis, liver transaminase abnormalities, and injection site reactions (ISRs). Due to the underlying pro-hemostatic effect of fitusi ran, the conc omitant treatment of breakthrough bleeding episodes with factor or BPA particularl y at doses higher than recommended in the protocol may confer an increased risk of thrombosis. For sum mary of the completed Phase 1 study, and preliminary interim results from the Phase 1/2 extension study, see Section 1.2.2; further details of fitusiran studies are presented in the Investigator’s Brochure. This clinical protocol has exclusion criteria intended to minimize the risk of thrombosis, liver transaminase abnormalities, and serious ISRs. With respect to the risk of thrombosis, the protocol include s detailed guidance and oversight on treatment of breakthrough bleeding episodes with reduced factor/BPA dosing (Section 6.3.1), and management of operative proce dures that occur while patients are on fitusiran (Section 6.6) . The protocol also excludes pa tients with evidence of liver disease (including active viral hepatitis) and stipulates ongoing monitoring f or elevated transaminases (Section 6.2.3.1). The safety of trial patients will be overse en by an independent DMC (Section 4.7). 2. OBJECT IVES 2.1.

Thr oughout the study, patients in the fitusiran treatment arm may receive on-demand treatment for breakthrough bleeding episodes with factor concentrates, as appropriate. For patients in the f itusiran tre atment arm who have received at least 1 dose of fitusiran and are being treated for breakthrough bleeding episodes, it is recommended to follow the guidelines provided in Section 6.3.1 per Investigator discretion. Blee ding events and doses of factor concentrates administered during the conduct of the study will be re corded in an electronic Diary (eDiary), as described in Section 7.2.1 . Since bleeding e pisodes are recorded as an efficacy assessment of fitusiran, these will not be treated as AE s unless the y meet any of the SAE criteria listed in Section 7.5.6.1. Safety, quality of life, pharmac odynamic, and pharmacokinetic data will also be collected. All patients will be treated for a total of 9 months; patients randomized to the fitusiran treatment arm will receive a total of 9 SC injections of fitusiran. Because the full PD effect of fitusiran is not ac hieved until approximately 28 days after receiving the first dose, efficacy will be assessed during the final 8 months on study (Day 29 to Month 9). Therefore, the overall fitusiran tre atment period is defined as the onset period (Day 1 to Day 28 after receipt of the first dose, during which the A T lowering capacity of fitusiran is increasing but has not yet reached therapeutic levels) plus the efficacy period (Day 29 and after, when the AT lowering capacity of fitusiran has ac hieved therapeutic target range). Patients may undergo unplanned or emergency surgery during the study, but must not schedule non-urgent surgery to occur during the study.

Any discontinuation of treatment or withdrawal from the study must be fully documented in the electronic case report form (eCRF), and should be followed up by the Investigator. The Investigator may withdraw a patient at any time if this is considered to be in the patient’s be st interest. Procedures for discontinuation of IMP and withdrawal from the study are described in Section 5.3.1 and Section 5.3.2 , r espectively. 5.3.1. Disco ntinuation of Investigational Medicinal Product The Investigator or designee may discontinue dosing in a patient if the patient:  I s in significant violation of the protocol  I s non-adherent to treatment regimen  Ex periences a serious or intolerable AE, a life-threatening bleeding episode, eg, any gastrointe stinal hemorrhage or intracranial hemorrhage, or life-threatening thromboembolic event  R equires a prohibited medication. The Inve stigator will confer with the Sponsor or study Medical Monitor before discontinuing dosing in the patient. Patients (or their guardian s) may decide to discontinue IMP. I n general, patients who discontinue IMP dosing for any reason will be encouraged to remain on the study to complete the remaining assessments through the end of study so that their experience is captured in the final analyses. If a patient discontinues dosing due to a serious adverse event (SAE), the SAE should be followed as described in Section 7.5.6. When a patient discontinues IMP dosing, the primary reason must be recorded in the appropriate section of the eCRF . Patients who discontinue IMP but who remain on study may receive treatment consistent with local st andard practice for their disease per Investigator judgment, as applicable. Safety will be c aptured for the entire duration of study for patients who discontinue treatment. 5.3.2. With drawal From Study A patient or guardian may withdraw consent from study participation at any time. The Investigator may withdraw a patient at any time if this is considered to be in the patient’s best interest. Any withdrawal from the study must be fully documented in the eCRF, and should be followed-up by the Investigator. However, study integrity and interpretation is best maintained if all enrolled patients continue study assessments and follow-up even if study treatment is discontinued. Patients considering withdrawing from the study should be informed that they can discontinue treatment and still remain in the study to complete study assessments and follow-up as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). If a patient still chooses to discontinue study treatment and withdraw from all follow -up, every effort should be made to conduct the EOS/ET assessments within 4 weeks of the last dose (see Table 1 ).

Treatments Administered Investigational medicinal product supplied for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study and must not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study. I nvestigational medicinal product that has been dispensed to a patient and returned unused must not be re-dispens ed to a different patient. 6.2. Investigational Medicinal Product Detailed information describing the preparation, administration, and storage of fitusiran is provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 6.2.1. De scription Fitusiran (SAR439774 ) solution for injection ( SC use) will be supplied as a sterile solution (see the Pharmacy Manual for further details of solution concentration and fill volume). 6.2.2. Dose and Administration Patients randomized to the fitusiran treatment arm receive open-label 80 mg fitusiran as an SC injec tion once monthly, for a total of 9 months; dosing will begin on Day 1 of the treatment period. Inv esti gational medicinal product injection will be administered at the clinic by qualified staff under the supervision of the Investigator or designee. Detailed instructions for IMP administration are found in the Pharmacy Manual. Investigational medicinal product will not be blinded as this is an open-label study. See Secti on 6.2.5 regarding packaging and labeling. If a patient does not receive a fitusiran dose within the specified dosing window ( Table 1 ) , the Investigator should contact the study Medical Monitor. After such consultation, the dose may be administered or considered missed and not administered. If a patient misses a dose, the Investigator, in consultation with the study Medical Monitor, will discuss whether the patient will be able to continue on the study. Additional details regarding dosing can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. 6.2.3. Dose Modifications No fitusiran dose modifications will be allowed. If a IMP-related AE occurs in a patient that the Inve stigator judges as presenting a potential risk to the patient for further dosing, the fitusiran dose may be held at the discretion of the Investigator and the study Medical Monitor should be contacted. 6.2.3.1.

Preparation, Handling, and Storage Qualified staff at each clinical study center will be responsible for preparation of fitusiran doses, accor ding to procedures detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. No special procedures for the safe handling of IMP are required. Investi gational medicinal product will be stored per the Pharmacy Manual and refrigerated at approxima tely 5±3°C. Deviations from the recommended storage conditions should be reported to the Sponsor a nd use of the IMP halted until authorization for its continued use has been provided b y the Sponsor or designee, as described in the Pharmacy Manual. A Sponsor re presentative or designee will be permitted, upon request, to audit the supplies, storage, dispensing procedures, and records. Instructions specific to unused IMP and additional storage details are provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 6.2.5. P ackaging and Labeling All packaging, labeling, and production of IMP will be in compliance with current Good Manufacturin g Practices, or local applicable regulations, where necessary. Investigational medicinal product labels and external packaging will include all appropriate information as per local labe ling requirements. Additional details will be available in the Pharmacy Manual. 6.2.6. Ac countability The Investigator or designee will maintain accurate records of receipt and the condition of the IMP supplied for this study, including dates of receipt. In addition, accurate records will be kept of when and how much IMP is dispensed and administered to each patient in the study. Any reasons for de parture from the protocol dispensing regimen must also be recorded. At the completion of the study, there will be a final reconciliation of all IMP. Further inst ructions about drug accountability are detailed in the Pharmacy Manual. Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, pertaining documentation, labeling, expiration date, etc) must be promptly notified to the Sponsor. Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure (see Section 7.5.6.8). A potentia l defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request made by the Sponsor, in order to recall the IMP and eliminate potential hazards. Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party (except for duties and taxes paid [DTP] shipment, for which a courier company has been approved by the Sponsor), allow the IMP to be used other than as directed by this clinical trial protocol, or dispose of IMP in any other manner. 6.3.

Any changes in medications during the study will also be recorded on the eCRF. Local standard treatment of hemophilia is considered to be, but not limited to, IV infusion of FVIII or FIX concentrates. Use of these concentrates will be captured in the patient’s eDiary. Use of prothrombin c omplex concentrates for bleeding episode management is not permitted. Antifibrinolytic s may be used as single agents, but may not be used in combination with factor concentrates or BPA. 6.3.1. M anagement of Bleeding Episodes The occurrence of bleeding episodes is a typical characteristic of hemophilia; [ 2, 5, 6] bleeding e pisodes will be recorded as an efficacy assessment of fitusiran and will not be considered as AEs unle ss the criteria for SAEs are met (see AEs definitions in Section 7.5.6.1). Bleeding episode s will be recorded in the eDiary. For bleeding episodes in which there was no factor concentrate infusion or other type of intervention employed, the reason the bleeding episodes were untre ated will be recorded in the eDiary (see Section 7.2.1). Inve stigators will establish and provide instructions for an individualized bleed management plan based on the g uidelines in Table 4 for each patient. The bleed management plan should be reviewed by the Investigator or designee with the patient at e ach clinic visit (and via telephone contact every 2 weeks between clinic visits) and updated as necessa ry. Doses of rFVIIa and aPCC are included for completeness. It is expected that these non-inhibitor patients will be routinely managed with FVIII and FIX. 6.3.1.1. Bleeding Episode Management Recommendations for Patients in the On- Demand Treatment Arm (Patients Not Receiving Fitusiran) For patients not receiving fitusiran (on-demand arm), bleeding management therapy with factor conce ntrate will be managed based on the local standard practice for treating hemophilia patients without inhibit ors, as routinely administered by the physician. Where clinical circumstances all ow, it is recommended that the patient contact the Investigator for all events that may be suspected to be or characteristic of a bleeding episode. If adequate hemostasis does not occur after two doses of factor concentrate, the patient should contact the site for further instruction. If the patient feels the need to administer doses higher than the patient’s bleeding episode management plan recommends, or at a higher frequency, it is recommended that the patient contact the site. See Section 7.2.1 regarding patient use of the eDiary and site alerts that will assi st in this process. 6.3.1.2. Bleeding Episode Management Recommendations for Patients in the Fitusiran Treat ment Arm Given the mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic profile of fitusiran, the factor concentrate dose necessary to safely and effectively treat breakthrough bleeding episodes will be lower than standardly pre scribed. This is supported by data from the Phase 1 study in which bleed events were managed with factor and BPA, as well as additional modeling and ex vivo spiking data. (electronic 1.0)"

After administration of fitusiran, AT lowering will be progressing toward therapeutic levels. As quickly as 7 days after the initial fitusiran dose, the majority of patients will have AT levels at or below 60% residual activity. By 14 days after dosing, it is expected that 94% of patients will have AT lowe ring of >50%, with a median value of 66.8 %. Based on these AT kinetics, it is recommended that patients continue with their standard factor regimens for the first 7 days following initiation of fitusiran dosing, with institution of the protocol-specific bleed management guidelines with reduced factor or BPA at Day 8 and beyond ( Table 4). P atients on fitusiran, will be provided a bleed management plan with appropriate dosing of factor concentrates for use during Day 1 through 7, as well as a bleed management plan with dosing for Day 8 and beyond. Thereafter the bleed management plan will be reviewed and updated at monthly visits, and new written plans provided to the patient if dosing changes. Importantly, during the treatment period, patients should not use factor concentrates or other hemostatic agents as prophylaxis for bleeding episode prevention, including doses related to anticipate d hemostatic challenges such as physical activity. For prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in patients who require operative procedures see Section 6.6. (e lectronic 1.0)"

Patients should continue with their standard factor/BPA regimens. Bleed Management Guidelines Day 8 and Beyond: When a patient experiences symptoms that may be consistent with bleeding episodes, the following steps should be followed: 1. P atient should be instructed to call the study center to discuss symptoms to determine whether or not they are consistent with a bleeding event and to discuss the appropriate factor/BPA dose to use. This interaction between patient and Investigator is recommended prior to the administration of each dose of factor or BPA. Confirmation of bleeds at the study center prior to treatment may be considered. Such visits should capture assessments per Section 6.4 and Table 2. 2. I f a determination is made that symptoms require treatment, the recommended treatment algorithm for bleeding episodes is described below: 1. A sing le dose can be administered according to the guidelines in Table 4. 2. The patient should be instructed to re-evaluate symptoms in 24 hours for bleeds treated with FVIII, FIX or aPCC and in 2-3 hours for bleeds treated with rFVIIa. a. Administration of FIX Extended half-life should not be more frequent than every 5-7 days. 3. If a second dose (in the case of FVIII, FIX or aPCC) or a third dose (in the case of rFVIIa) is needed, the patient must call the study center before dosing. a. Consider evaluation and treatment of the patient at the study center and confirmation of bleeds when any repeated doses are needed (See Section 6.4 and Table 2) . b. I f more than two doses of FVIII, FIX or aPCC or three doses of rFVIIa are needed, the patient should be seen at the study center within 48-72 hours. 4. Doses should not be administered at less than 24-hour intervals (except rFVIIa as indicated in Table 4). 5. Doses should not exceed the protocol maximum recommended dose indicated in Table 4. 6. C onsultation with the study Medical Monitor and Clinical Advisor should be considered for clinical circumstances below, that may warrant AT replacement: a. Doses of factor or BPA higher than those recommended in Table 4 b. Dos ing of factor or BPA at decreased intervals than those recommended in Table 4 c. Multiple or r epeated doses of factor or BPA 7.

Bleeding Episode Management Following Discontinuation of Fitusiran Patie nts who opt to discontinue fitusiran may resume standard on-demand dosing with factor concentr ates (FVIII, FIX) when their AT residual activity level returns to approximately 60% (per the central laboratory). An earlier restart of standard treatment may be considered in conjunction with consulta tion from the study Medical Monitor, if a strong medical need arises (eg, increased frequency of bleeding). If full doses of factor or BPA are required to achieve hemostasis prior to AT recovery of approximately 60% residual activity per the central laborator y, AT replacement should be considered. 6.3.2. Other Concomitant Medications If patients use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs intermittently or chronically, they must be able to tolera te them and have had no previous side effects (eg, gastric distress or bleeding). Use of >4 g acetaminophen per day is not permitted. Treatment for HIV is permitted and must be recorded as concomitant medication. Standard vitamins and topical medications are permitted. However, topical steroids must not be applied anywhere near the injection site(s) unless medically indicated. Any concomitant medication that is required for the patient’s welfare may be prescribed by the I nvestigator. However, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that details regarding the medication are recorded on the eCRF. Concomitant medication will be coded using an internationally recognized and accepted coding dictionary. 6.4. Assessment of Coagulation Parameters at the Time of a Bleed Any patient who presents to the clinical study center for evaluation of symptoms that are suspected as cha racteristic of a bleeding episode, the patient should be assessed by the Investigator to determine whether symptom(s) require treatment. If treatment is required, blood samples should be collected predose and postdose and assessments performed as scheduled in Table 2. If a patient presents following administration of factor or BPAs at home and within 48 hours of the dose , and no further treatment is given at the center, AT and the postdose assessments in Table 2 should be obtained in a single draw at any time during the visit. 6.5. Mo nitoring and Management of Thrombotic Events Given safety events observed thus far and the possible thrombotic risk associated with fitusiran’s AT lowering mechanism, which may be increased with concurrent use of factor replacement products or BPAs, there should be a low threshold to evaluate any signs and symptoms consistent with thrombosis, including symptoms consistent with CVST. Symptoms of thrombosis may include a severe or persistent headache, headache with nausea and vomiting, chest pain/tightness, coughing up blood, trouble breathing, abdominal pain, fainting or loss of consciousness, vision problems, and swelling or pain in the arms or legs.

AT reversal should follow labeled product recommendations for the prevention of perioperative thrombosis in patients with AT deficiency, and patient doses individualized to target 80-120% AT activity. The use of plasma derived AT may be preferable to recombinant AT, given its longer half-life. It is recommended that cases of thrombosis are discussed with the study Medical Monitor and Clinical Advisor (see Section 7.5.6.1 for further information regarding Adverse Events of Spe cial Interest). 6.6. Elective and/or Emergency Surgery If an urgent need for surgery arises during the study period, the study Medical Monitor will be informed and the perioperative hemostatic treatment plan will be communicated to the study Medical Monit or unless clinical circumstances do not allow. It is rec ommended that, when possible, any elective non-dental major surgery be performed at a clinica l study center. For reference, see Appendix (Section 11.2.1 ) for definitions of minor and major surgery. Perioperative Treatment Plan In patients in both the on-demand arm and the fitusiran treatment arm undergoing surgery, a wr itten perioperative treatment plan will be reviewed with the study Medical Monitor before conducting the procedure, unless clinical circumstances do not allow. In patients on fitusiran, the perioperative treatment plan should be developed using the same principles as bleed mana gement described in Section 6.3.1 and the guideline below:  I f the clinical circumstance is such that the recommended doses and/or dose intervals in Table 4 are deemed insufficient for hemostasis, consider AT replacement and manage thrombot ic risk as per Investigator practice for a hemophilia patient undergoing that particular surgery.  Non-pharmacologic methods of thromboprophylaxis should also be employed as clinically indicated. Fitusiran Treatment During the Perioperative Evaluation Period For re ference, see Appendix (Section 11.2.1 ) for definitions of minor and major surgery. If the ne ed for a major surgery arises during the trial and the procedure is not an emergency or urgent, it is recommended that the procedure be postponed until after completion of the trial. For minor operative procedures, dosing with fitusiran may continue uninterrupted. If the ne ed for emergency or urgent major surgery arises during the trial, the patient should be managed medically according to the guidelines above.

Effica cy Assessments Bleeding Episode Definitions A bleeding episode is defined as any occurrence of hemorrhage that requires administration of factor c oncentrates or BPA infusion, eg, hemarthrosis, muscle, or mucosal bleeding episodes. Since blee ding episodes are recorded as an efficacy assessment of fitusiran, these will not be treated as AEs unless they meet any of the SAE criteria listed in Section 7.5.6.1. The de finition of bleeding episode types described below is based on consensus opinion of International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) as reflected in a recent public ation. [10] The start time of a bleeding episode will be considered the time at which symptoms of a bleeding e pisode first develop. Bleeding, or any symptoms of bleeding at the same location, that occurs within 72 hours of the last injection used to treat a bleeding episode at that location will be considere d a part of the original bleeding event, and will count as one bleeding episode towards the ABR . Any bleeding symptoms that begin more than 72 hours from the last injection used to treat a blee ding episode at that location will constitute a new bleeding event. A spontaneous ble eding episode is a bleeding event that occurs for no apparent or known reason, particularl y into the joints, muscles, and soft tissues. A joint bleeding episode is characterized by an unusual sensation in the joint (“aura”) in combination with 1) increasing swelling, or warmth over the skin over the joint, 2) increasing (electronic 1.0)"

A muscle bleed may be characterized by pain, swelling and loss of movement over the affected muscle group. A ta rget joint is defined as a joint where 3 or more spontaneous bleeding episodes in a single joint within a consecutive 6-month period has occurred; where there have been ≤2 bleeding episodes in the joint within a consecutive 12-month period the joint is no longer considered a target joint. A traumatic bleeding episode is one that is caused by a known injury or trauma. Bleeding episodes sustained during sports and recreation will be counted as traumatic bleeding episodes, but patients will be asked to indicate in the eDiary that the event occurred during such activities. Training will be provided on this and other aspects of eDiary use (see Section 7.2.1). Annualiz ed bleeding rate will be calculated as described in Section 8.2.5.1. Bleeding episodes will be mana ged according to Section 6.3.1 . 7.2.1. E lectronic Diary Patients will be issued an eDiary to record all bleeding events and all doses of factor concentrates administe red during the conduct of the study. Entries are to be made in a timely manner, and it is preferred that doses are entered immediately upon administration or within 24 hours. Patients will be prompted to ente r bleeding location, severity, causality (spontaneous or traumatic), doses of fac tor concentrates, and reasons for dosing (prophylaxis, treatment of a bleed, and preventive dose for anticipated activity). Training of patients should be documented in the appropriate source record. The Sponsor or an independent delegate will review diary entries for data quality to identify issues such as subjects who may need retraining on diary use and timely entry of bleeding episode information. Bleeding episodes will be recorded by the patient in the eDiary, and reviewed by the Investigator (and Sponsor or independent delegate) continuously for the study duration. The site will contact the patient at a minimum interval of every 2 weeks per schedule of assessments to review diary records and ensure that the patient is utilizing the device appropriately. Sites will be notified when patients enter initial treatments for bleeding events into their eDiaries. If the dose amount exceeds the recommended dose according to the bleeding management plan, the patien t must be contacted as soon as possible, preferably within 24-48 hours of receiving the alert. At the tim e of contact the patient’s clinical condition will be reviewed along with the dose and efficacy of the treatment given, and the Investigator will provide appropriate guidance regarding further management of the bleeding episode. The site will also receive an alert, and must make contact with the patient as soon as possible if a third dose of product is administered for a single bleed, to review clinical condition, the need for further therapy, and appropriate ongoing management of the bleeding episode required to achieve hemostasis. In addit ion, patients will be instructed to contact the site if they feel they need to administer fa ctor concentrates at a h igher dose level or higher frequency than their bleeding management plan recomm ends, or if more than two doses are required to achieve hemostasis.

Pharmacodynamic Assessments In this study AT activity level and thrombin generation will be collected as measurements of PD e ffec t. These measurements will be collected and analyzed centrally for research purposes. As interpretation is uncertain, TG thrombin generation results will not be used to adjust dosing of fitusiran or guide other elements of study conduct or clinical management and will not be shared with sites until after study completion. If clinical circumstances arise for which AT activity levels are required to guide patient care, local laboratory assessments may be drawn. 7.3.1. Antithro mbin Activity AT activity level will be assessed according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1); samples will be collected within 4 hours prior to dosing. Antithrombin levels will be determined by valida ted assay. Antithrombin protein may be measured in a subset of plasma samples for correl ation. Results will be collected and interpreted centrally. In the fitusiran treatment arm patients who do not enroll in the extension study, following final fitusi ran dose , AT activity level will be monitored at monthly intervals until returning to an activity level of approximately 60% (per the central laboratory) or per Investigator discretion in c onsultation with the stud y Medical Monitor. 7.3.2. T hrombin Generation Thrombin generation will be assessed according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) using a functi onal assay per the Laboratory Manual, and will be collected and interpreted centrally. 7.3.3. E xploratory Analyses Except where prohibited by local or national regulations, in consented patients, plasma, serum, and urine samples may be archived and used for analyses of exploratory biomarkers related to the metabolic profiling or effects of fitusiran and for the development of modified thrombin generation assays, and may also be archived for use in other exploratory analyses related to hemophilia and its complications. In addition, where permitted in consented patients, serum samples may be used for analysis of circulating RNA, including the assessment of cleaved AT RNA, and a sample of DNA may be obtaine d and ar chived to permit potential confirmation of hemophilia mutation or genotyping of hemophilia modifier genes or genes that may modify the effects of fitusiran. 7.4. Pharm acokinetic Assessments Blood samples will be collected for assessment of PK including metabolites (as necessary) in all fitusiran a rm patients according to the collection schedule presented in Table 7 on the days spec ified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ).

The concentration of fitusiran will be determined using a validated assay. Full details regarding the processing, shipping, and analysis of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. 7.5. Safety Assessments The assessment of safety during the course of the study will consist of the surveillance and recording of AEs, including SAEs, recording of concomitant medication and measurements of vital si gns, weight and height, physical examinations, ECG findings, and laboratory tests. Safe ty data will be periodically reviewed over the course of the study by the DMC as described in Se ction 4.7. 7.5.1. Vital S igns Vital signs will be measured as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1) and will include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate. Vital signs will be measured pr edose in the seated or supine position, after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes. B ody temperature in degrees Celsius will be obtained via oral, tympanic, or axillary methods. Heart r ate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and respiration rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute. For the safety of the patient, additional vital sign assessments may be added at the discretion of the Inve stigator. Vital signs results will be recorded in the eCRF. 7.5.2.

E lectrocardiogram Triplicate standard 12-lead ECGs, with readings approximately 1 minute apart, will be recorded as specified in t he Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). Patients should be supine for at least 5 mi nutes before each ECG is obtained. The electrophysiological parameters assessed will be rhythm, ve ntricular rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, Bazett-corrected QT interval (QTcB), and Fridericia corrected QT interval (QTcF). When ECG and blood sample collection occur at the same time, ECGs should be performed before blood samples are drawn. The Investigator or qualified designee will review all ECGs to assess whether the results have changed since the Baseline visit and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments will be recorded on the eCRF. Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of the Investigator. Recordings will be archived according to the Study Manual. 7.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments The following clinical laboratory tests will be evaluated by a central laboratory. Specific instructions for transaminase elevations are provided in Section 6.2.3.1 . For any other une xplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after IMP administration, the test should be re peated and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to adequately explain the abnormality. Additional safety laboratories and assessments as indicated by the clinical situation may b e requested. Clinical laboratory assessments are listed in Table 5 and assessments will be assessed a s specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). W hile local laboratory results may be used for urgent clinical and dosing decisions, on the day of the clinic visi t assessments, all laboratory assessments specified in Table 5 which are performed a t the clinic should also be sent in parallel to the central laboratory.

Adverse events characterized as intermittent require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence. When changes in the severity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should be noted. If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). Adverse event severity and seriousness are assessed independently. ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity of an AE. ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAE ). Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Treatment The relationship of each AE to study treatment should be evaluated by the Investigator using the following criteria: Definitely related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, occurring in a plausible time relationship to the medication administration, and which cannot be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. The response to withdrawal of the drug should be clinically plausible. Possibly related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a reasonable time sequence to the medication administration, but which could also b e explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals. Information on the drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear . Unlikely related: A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with little or no temporal relationship to medication administration, and which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide plausible explanations .

Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events Eliciting Adverse Events The patient should be asked about medically relevant changes in his health since the last visit, with attention t o any signs and symptoms that could be consistent with thrombosis. The patient should a lso be asked if he has been hospitalized, had any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC). In addition to patient observations, AE s will be documented from any clinically relevant laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are relevant to patient safety. Recording Adverse Events The Investigator is responsible for recording non-serious AEs and SAEs that are observed or reported b y the patient after the time when the informed consent is signed regardless of their relationship to IMP through the end of study. Non-serious AEs will be followed until the end of study. S AEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until baseline level is reached, or until the SAE is considere d by the Investigator to be chronic or the patient is stable, as appropriate. All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for the pa tient, whether or not they are considered to be drug-related. Each AE must be described in detail: onset time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to investigational drug, action taken, and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). For SAEs, r ecord the event(s) on both the eCRF and the SAE form. For AEs that are considered AESI (Section 7.5.6.1 ), the Sponsor or its designee should be noti fied within 24 hours using a supplemental AESI eCRF.

Since bleeding episodes are recorded as an efficacy assessment of fitusiran, these will not be treated as AEs unless they meet any of the SAE criteria listed in Section 7.5.6.1. The manifestatio n and frequency of bleeding episodes is an efficacy indicator of this study and ABR is the focus of the primary and secondary efficacy analyses. Recording an ISR For a ll ISRs, the Investigator, or delegate, should submit a supplemental ISR eCRF, recording additional information (eg, description s, onset and resolution date, severity, treatment given, e vent outcome). An ISR is defined as a local reaction at or near the site of injection. “At or near” the injection site includes reactions at the injection site, adjacent to the injection site, or a reaction which may shift slightly away from the injection site due to gravity (eg, as may occur with swelling or hematoma). Reactions with onset and resolution within 4 hours of the injection (eg, transient pain/burnin g at injection site) do not meet the study definition of ISRs, unless immediate trea tment is required. A systemic reaction which includes the injection site, eg, generalized urticaria, other distinct entities, or conditions like lymphadenopathy that may be near the injection si te is not considered an ISR.

All completed questionnaires or instrument forms for the patient-reported outcome assessments described below will be collected, entered into a database, and archived according to the Study Manual. The Sponsor or designee will provide the translations for all survey instruments, where translations are available. The sites must not translate any survey instruments. 7.6.1.1. HRQOL In struments: Haem-A- QOL and Haemo- QOL The Hemophilia Quality of Life Questionnaire for Adults (Haem-A-QOL) and Hemophilia Qua lity of Life Questionnaire for Children and Adolescents (Haemo-QOL) are psychometrically tested QOL assessment instruments for patients with hemophilia. [11] The Haem-A-QOL will be pr ovided to patients ≥17 years of age, and includes 46 items contributing to 10 QOL domains (physic al health, feelings, view of yourself, sports and leisure, work and school, dealing with hemophilia, treatment, future, family planning, partnership and sexuality). Scoring for each item is based on a 5-point Likert scale (never, rarely, sometimes, often, and all the time), and higher scores r epresent greater impairment. The Haemo-QOL (Children’s short version for age groups II/III [8 -16 years of age]) will be provided to pati ents <17 years of age, to self-complete as specified in the Schedule of (electronic 1.0)"

The same questionnaire used during the Baseline visit will be utilized throughout the study. 7.6.1.2. TSQM-9 The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) will assess patient satisfaction with t reatm ent. The TSQM is a validated psychometric tool that provides a general measure of patient satisfaction with medication. [12] Where available, the TSQM questionnaire will be distributed to patients to self-complete as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). 7.6.1.3. HAL The Hemophilia Activities List ( HAL ) and the Pedi atric HAL (pedHAL) questionnaires will a ssess subjec tive functional ability to perform activities of daily living. [13] The HAL will be a ssessed in patients ≥18 years of age and the pedHAL will be assessed in patients <18 years of age. Where available, the HAL questionnaire will be distributed to patients to self-complete as spec ified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ) . 7.6.1.4. EQ-5D-5L The EQ-5D- 5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of QOL outcome. [14] It consists of a questionnaire pertaining to 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and a visual analog scale. Scoring of the questionnaire is based on 5 degrees of disability (none, slight, moderate, severe, or extreme). Scoring of the visual analog scale is based on a visual scale ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). Higher scores indicate better health status. The questionnaires will be completed by all patients as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1). 7.6.2. We ight-adjusted Consumption of Factor Concentrates Factor concentrate dose will be recorded by the patient in the eDiary and reviewed by the Investigator (and Sponsor or delegate) for the study duration to assess on-demand factor concentr ate use as treatment of breakthrough bleeding episodes. Weight adjustment will be calculated programmatically. 7.6.3. HJH S The HJHS is a tool for assessment of joint health in subjects with hemophilia.[ 15] Joint health status wil l be assessed via the HJHS, as administered by a healthcare professional trained in the use of anthropometric measures, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1). C ompleted HJHS score forms will be collected and archived according to the Study Manual. 8. STATISTICS A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized before database lock.

Determi nation of Sample Size Assuming a mean ABR of 18 with standard deviation (SD) = 14 in the on-demand arm (patients randomized to receive on-demand factor concentrates) and a mean ABR of no more than 4 with SD = 6 in the fitusiran treatment arm (patients randomized to receive fitusiran) in either the effica cy period or treatment period, with a sample size of 32 evaluable patients in on-demand arm and a pproximately 64 evaluable patients in the fitusiran treatment arm, it is projected that the stud y will have greater than 90% power for testing treatment difference in mean ABRs. This power estimation was based on a negative binomial regression model with a 2- sided type I error rate of 0.05. The planned sample size i s 120 randomized patients assuming a 20% drop-out rate. 8 .2. Stat istical Methodology The statistical and analytical plans presented below are brief summaries of planned analyses. More complete plans will be detailed in the SAP. Changes to the methods described in the final SAP will be desc ribed and justified as needed in the clinical study report. 8.2.1. P opulations to be Analyzed The populations (analysis sets) are defined as follows:  I ntent- to-treat (ITT) Analysis Set: All randomized patients. All by-treatment analyses based on the I TT analysis set will be according to the randomized treatment arm.  S afety Analysis Set: All patients who received at least 1 dose of fitusiran or were randomiz ed to on-demand arm. All by-treatment analyses based on the safety analy sis set will be according to the actual treatment received.  P er-protocol Analysis Set: All patients in the ITT set who had no major protocol deviations. Major deviations will be specified in the SAP.  PK Analysis Set: All patients who receive at least 1 dose of fitusiran and have at least one postdose blood sample for PK parameters and who have evaluable PK data.  Ope rative Procedure Analysis Set: All patients who received at least 1 dose of fitusiran and underwent at least 1 operative procedure during the study. 8.2.2. E xamination of Subgroups Exploratory subgroup analysis on ABR will be conducted for the primary endpoint and selected secondar y endpoints. Description of the subgroups will be specified in the SAP. 8.2.3. Han dling of Missing Data Handling of missing data will be described in the SAP. (electronic 1.0)"

Baseline Evaluations Demographics and other disease-specific baseline characteristics will be summarized for the ITT Analysis Set and Safety Analysis Set. 8.2.5. E fficacy Analyses Primary analyses of the primary and secondary endpoints will be based on the ITT Analysis Set. To control for the familywise error rate in the testing of primary and secondary endpoints, a hierarchical testing approach will be used in the following order: 1. AB R in efficacy period (2 -sided alpha = 0.05) 2. AB R in treatment period (2-sided alpha = 0.05) 3. Annua lized spontaneous bleeding rate in efficacy period (2 -sided alpha = 0.05) 4. Annua lized joint bleeding rate in efficacy period (2 -sided alpha = 0.05) 5. C hange in physical health score and total score of Haem-A-QOL in treatment period (2-sided alpha = 0.05) If testing of any of the endpoints is not statistically significant, testing of subsequent endpoints will stop and the null hypotheses for the subsequent tests will not be rejected. The testing of seconda ry endpoint ABR in the onset period will not be included in this hierarchical testing procedure. 8.2.5.1. Primary Endpoint The primary analysis will be performed on the ITT Analysis Set and will include all bleeding e pisodes occurring in the efficacy period (Day 29 to Day 246) including bleeding episode data c ollected after discontinuation of IMP. If a patient does not have bleeding episode data collected after D ay 28 (eg, due to early study discontinuation), the available bleeding episode data starting from Day 1 will be used as bleeding episode data of the fitusiran period in the primary analysis. To avoid confounding the treatment effect, bleeding episode data during and after major surgery, AT administration, major trauma, or initiation of prophylaxis treatment with factor concentrates will be e xcluded from the primary analysis. The number of bleeding episodes will be analyzed using a negative binomial model with fixed effects of treatment arm and the number of bleeding episodes in the 6 months prior to study entry (≤10 vs >10) and hemophilia type (hemophilia A or B). The logarithm number of days that each patie nt spends in the efficacy period matching the bleeding episode data being analyzed will be included as an of fset variable to account for unequal follow-up time due to early withdrawal or surgery. The p-value comparing bleeding rates in the 2 treatment arms and the ratio of bleeding rates in the f itusiran treatment arm to the on-demand arm along with its 95% CI will be presented. The estimated mean ABRs in each of the 2 treatment arms along with their 95% Ci s will be prese nted from this model. In addition, summary statistics for ABR, including median and interquartile range, will be presented for each treatment arm, where ABR is defined as: total number of qualifying bleeding episodes total numbe r of days in the respective period × 365 .25 (electronic 1.0)"

Sensitivity analyses will be performed to evaluate the impact of missing data under different missing data mechanisms and details will be specified in the statistical analysis plan. 8.2.5.2. Secondary Endpoints The bleeding episodes in the treatment period (Day 1 to Day 246), spontaneous bleeding e pisode s in the efficacy period, joint bleeding episodes in the efficacy period, and bleeding episode s in the onset period will be analyzed using the same method as primary analysis of ABR. Summar y statistics, including median and interquartile range, for annualized rates of these endpoints will be reported. The cha n ge from baseline in physical health score and total score of Haem-A-QOL will be anal yzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with fixed effects of treatment arm, baseline Haem-A-QOL physical health score and total score, the number of bleeding episodes in the 6 months prior to study entry (≤10 vs >10), and hemophilia type (hemophilia A or B) as c ovariates. Domain scores for Haem-A-QOL and their changes from baseline will be summarized descriptively by scheduled visit. 8.2.5.3. Exploratory Endpoints Details of the analyses for the exploratory endpoints will be described in the SAP. 8.2.6.

Correlation between AT and thrombin levels may be explored. 8.2.7. P harmacokinetic Analysis Pharmac okinetic analyses will be conducted using a population PK approach on patients in the fitusi ran arm. The details of the analysis will be presented in a separated population PK analysis plan. In a ddition to performing population PK analyses, the following PK parameters will be included in an analysis of East Asian patients in the fitusiran arm at East Asian sites: maximum plasma c oncentr ation (C max), time to maximum plasma concentration (t max), elimination half-life (t ½β), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), apparent clearance (CL/F), and apparent volume of distribution (V/F); these parameters will be estimated during the fitusiran treatment period using non-compartmental analysis. Other parameters may be calculated, if deemed necessary. 8.2.8. Safety Analyses Extent of exposure will be summarized. Safety will be based on all AEs having onset (start or worsening in severity) within the study and on the Safety Analysis Set.

Perioperative Schedule of Assessments 11.2.1. Definitions of Minor and Major Surgery Minor surgery is defined as any invasive operative procedure in which only skin, mucous membranes, or superficial connective tissue is manipulated and does not meet the criteria for major surge ry (eg, dental extraction of <3 non-molar teeth). Minor surgical procedures may be performed at a local health care provider institution. Major surgery is defined as any invasive operative procedure that requires any of the following:  Ope ning into a major body cavity (eg, abdomen, thorax, skull)  Ope ration on a joint  R emoval of an organ  De ntal extraction of any molar teeth or ≥3 non-molar teeth  Ope rative alteration of normal anatomy  C rossing of a mesenchymal barrier (eg, pleura, peritoneum, dura) It is recommended that any elective non-dental major surgery be performed at a clinical study center, when possible. 11.2.2. Perioperative Assessments of Safety and Hemostatic Efficacy in Patients Undergoing Operative Procedures In patients undergoing operative procedures during the treatment period, safety and hemostatic efficacy assessments will be performed according to the Perioperative Schedule of Assessments (described below and outlined in Table 10 ) , where possible. After a review of medical and surgery history has been completed, patients will have the following assessed as specified in the Perioperative Schedule of Assessments ( Table 10): dire cted physical examination and assessment of vital sign measurements; clinical laboratory assessments including hematology (complete blood count, white blood count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets); coagulation (APTT, PT/INR, fibrinogen, D-dimer); hepatic assessments; and hemostatic efficacy assessments (rating scale based on ISTH Scientific and Standardization Committee [SSC] definitions).[ 10] ( electronic 1.0)"

If multipl e visits are planned between Days 2-14 after the procedure, the perioperative questionnaire for Postoperative Visit 2 should be completed on the day of the last visit. d Directed physical examination (see Section 7.5.3 ). e Vital signs will be the same as conducted in the clinical study protocol Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 ). f Clinical laboratory assessments will include coagulation, hematology, and biochemistry ( Table 5 ). g If factor or BPA administration and the surgical procedure occur at the study center visit, one sample should be collected pre- factor/BPA administration and two samples should be collected post- factor/BPA administration on the day of the procedure. The pre- factor/BPA sample may be collected any time before factor or BPA administration. The post- factor/BPA samples should optimally be collected at 10 min (±5 min) and 60 min (±10 min) after factor or BPA administration. The actual times o f collections should be recorded. h If the operative procedure is not performed at a study center, the assessment is recommended. i Not necessary if captured at preoperative screening. j Hemostatic efficacy is to be assessed intraoperatively with the perioperative questionnaire on the day of the procedure (SDay 0); assessment may be completed up to 8 hours postoperatively. The perioperative questionnaire will also be completed at Postoperative Visit 1 and Visit 2. It is recommended that the Investigator complete this assessment in consultation with the surgeon or dentist who performed the operative procedure. k If factor or BPA administration occurs at the study center visit, then assessments should be collected at the following time points: pre- factor/BPA administration; 10 min (±5 min) post-factor/BPA administration; and 60 minutes (±10 min) post- factor/BPA administration. The actual times of collection should be recorded. l The date/time of when perioperative hemostatic treatment and thromboprophylaxis (if applicable) coverage was completed will be captured. If completed at Postoperative Visit 2, the date/time of completion should be recorded and the SDay 28 visit is not required. (electronic 1.0)"
