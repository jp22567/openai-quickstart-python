Section Modified Text or Description Rationale 6.5 Study-Drug Accountability The Investigator must keep an accurate record of the number of cartons received, the study drug dispensed/used, and those returned to the Sponsor or designee. The Sponsor will provide forms to facilitate inventory control. All study-drug accountability forms and treatment logs must be retained in the Investigator’s permanent study file, and these records must be available for inspection at any time by the Sponsor, its designees, or by regulatory agencies. The study monitor will perform drug accountability for all study drug at the site, and will assist in returning all used, unused, and expired study drug, to the Sponsor/designee , or verify study-drug destruction according to the study site’s standard operating procedure, if it is accepted by the Sponsor. designee . To accommodate sites with SOPs in place for destruction of unused study drug. 6.7 Study-Drug Administration Study drug is to be administered to all patients in the clinic by designated and trained study personnel. Study drug should be prepared in advance and injected subcutaneously according to the following instructions: •Remove study drug from refrigerated condition and allow to warm to room temperature for 15 minutesprior to administration. Study drug should be administered within 4 hours. •Identify location for injections. Study drug may be injected in the abdomen, upper arm, or thigh. All injections administered at a single visit should begiven in the same area, but may be split up into different areas for Week 0 and Week 2, which have 4 injections/visit. Injection sites should be ≥10 cm from one another. If possible, injections should not be administered at sites with active AD or other skin lesions. •Inject study drug subcutaneously. •Record location of study injections in the eCRF. •Properly dispose of used syringe according to site requirements. Syringe box must be kept for full drugaccountability.Feedback from investigators indicated that patients may prefer not having 4 injections given at the same site."

Study-Drug Unblinding The Sponsor or designee, the Investigator, study-site personnel, and the patient will be blinded to treatment assignment. The integrity of the clinical study will be maintained by observing the treatment blind. If knowledge of a patient’s treatment assignment is required for the patient’s clinical care and/or safety, the Investigator will open the Code-Breaking Card received with the study-drug kit. The Code-Breaking Card should be stored in a secure, locked location at the site. The Investigator should have access to the Code-Breaking Card at all times (e.g., 24/7) . is permitted to use the IWRS to obtain treatment assignment. The Investigator should consult with the Sponsor’s medical monitor prior to obtaining treatment assignment information. The Investigator must document (in the patient’s medical record) the date and time the blind was broken, the names of the personnel involved, and the reason that treatment assignment information was required. Because of the secondary packaging used for the kits in this study, the CRO was unable to accommodate use of an IWRS system. Instead, in the event of an unblinding, Code-Breaking Cards will be used. 6.7. Study-Drug Administration Study drug is to be administered to all patients in the clinic by designated and trained study personnel. Study drug should be prepared in advance and injected subcutaneously according to the following instructions: •Remove study drug from refrigerated condition and allow to warm to room temperature for 15 minutesprior to administration. Study drug should be administered within 4 hours. •Identify location for injections. Study drug may be injected in the abdomen, upper arm, or thigh.

Exposure and Compliance The extent of exposure to study drug in each treatment group will be summarized by total number of days of exposure, total number of applications, number of missed applications, and number and percentage of patients who are compliant. An application is considered the full set of injections (either 2 or 4 depending on visit) specified by the protocol. A patient will be considered compliant with the dosing regimen if the patient received ≥75% of the expected number of applications while enrolled in the study. Clarification Appendix 1. Schedule of Visits and Procedures •Changed D224 to D225 •Noted that urine pregnancy test is for WOCBP only •Added DLQI, HADS, and Global Assessment of Change to Early-Termination visit.Changes to reconcile the Schedule of Visits and Procedures with the Study Procedures Appendix 5. Body Surface Area (BSA) The BSA assessment estimates the extent of disease or skin involvement with respect to AD and is expressed as a percentage of total body surface. Determine BSA using the patient’s palm = 1% rule. The patient’s palm is measured from the wrist to the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) and thumb. Estimate the number of palms it takes to cover the affected AD area. Add up the number of palms to give a total estimate of the area covered in AD. Below are estimates when entire areas (anterior and posterior) are covered: Head and Neck = 10% (10 palms) Upper Extremities = 20 % (20 palms) Trunk (axillae and groin) = 40 30% (4030 palms) Lower extremities (buttocks) = 40 % (40 palms) BSA scores adjusted to sum to 100%."

Lebrikizumab DRM06-AD01-A2 Protocol: DRM06-AD01_A2 Page 16 Confidential 1 BACKGROUND 1.1 Atopic Dermatitis Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a relapsing and remitting inflammatory skin diso rder that aff ects all age groups.1 It is chronic and incurable, and is characterized by skin-barrier disruption and immune dysregulation (largely mediated by type-2 helper T cells).1 Clinically, AD is characterized by xerosis, erythematous crusted eruption (dermatosis), lichenification, an impaired skin barrier, and intense pruritus.2 AD flares are frequently triggered by exposure to environmental factors, irritants, and allergens.3 Although estimates of AD prevalence vary widely across different studies due to differences in data collection methodology, inconsistent age group assessment, and study periods, AD is one of the most common dermatologic diseases—15 ‒30% of children and 2 ‒10% of adults are affected, and prevalence appears to have increased over the past two to three decades.4 There appears to be some geographic variability in prevalence. Prevalence in children has been estimated to be 5.9 ‒16.0% in Western Europe and 10.7% in the United States (US) 5, 6 In adults, prevalence has been reported as 0.3 ‒2.0% in Europe, 4.9% in the United Kingdom (UK), and 2.4‒6.0% in the US.7 With respect to disease severity, 14% of AD patients in the UK have moderate disease and 2% have severe disease.8 A recent US study measuring AD severity in children found that for 67% disease was mild, for 26% it was moderate, and for 7% it was severe. 9 Approximately 85% of all cases of AD begin before age 5, with up to 70% of children having spontaneous remission before adolescence.2 Patients with AD have a high disease burden and their quality of life (QoL) is significantly affected. In one study, AD was shown to have a greater negative effect on patient mental health than diabetes and hypertension. 10 Patients with moderate-to-severe AD have a higher prevalence of social dysfunction and sleep impairment, which are directly related to the severity of the disease.4 Depression, anxiety, and social dysfunction not only affect patients with AD, but also affect their caregivers.10 Compared with psoriasis, another common and debilitating skin disease, patients with AD have lower physica l vitality, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health scores.11 The therapeutic approach to AD primarily consists of trigger avoidance, skin hydration with bathing, and use of emollients and anti-inflammatory therapies consisting predominantly of topical corticosteroids (TCS). In many patients, treatment with TCS provides some measure of symptomatic relief but does not adequately control the disease. In those patients who have persistent moderate- to-severe disease not responding adequately to TCS, guidelines outline several step-up therapeutic options.12, 13 The step-up options include topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), phototherapy, and immunosuppressive agents such as oral corticosteroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil. Among these, only cyclosporine is approved for treatm ent of moderate-to-severe AD (nationally licensed in many European countries, but not in the U.S.), and its use is limited to patients ≥16 years for a maximum treatment period of 8 weeks (Neoral®). Recently, the anti-IL-4R agent, dupilimab, was approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD. Dupilimab’s mechanism of action is likely through inhibition of heterodimerization of the IL-4R α/IL-13Rα1 complex, preventing IL-13 from initiating downstream signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway."

Lebrikizumab DRM06-AD01-A2 Protocol: DRM06-AD01_A2 Page 17 Confidential 1.2 Lebrikizumab Lebrikizumab is a humanized monoclonal immunogl obulin (Ig) G4 antibody (huIgG4) with a mutation in the hinge reg ion for increased stability. Lebrikizumab binds specifically to soluble human interleukin (IL)-13 with high affinity, and potently inhibits IL-13 signaling through the IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1 complex. Because lebrikizumab binds to IL-13 in a non-receptor binding domain (i.e., a portion of the molecule not involved in binding to its receptor), antibody-bound IL-13 can still bind its receptor (IL-13 Rα 1), but the receptor complex is not activated. Because lebrikizumab does not bind to IL-13 in mice, the most commonly used species for animal models of AD, it was not possible to perform in vivo lebrikizumab pharmacology or efficacy studies in an animal model of AD. However, several non-clinical studies in the literature demonstrate increased expression of IL-13 in affected skin, supporting the use of an anti-IL-13 therapeutic for human AD. Two previous studies were conducted with lebrikizumab in patients with AD. They are described in Section 1.3.2. See the Lebrikizumab Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for additional det ails on lebrikizumab non-clinical and clin ical studies. 1.3 Study Rationale and Benefit-Risk Assessment 1.3.1 Scientific Rationale: Evidence of the Role of IL-13 in AD AD is a T-helper type 2 (Th-2)-driven inflammato ry disease. Several lines of evidence from published literature implicate IL-13 a s a key component of AD pathobiology: • Genetic studies have shown that polymorphisms in the gene for IL-13,14, 15 and in the IL-4Rα receptor16 are associated with an increased risk for developing AD. • IL-13 can act on keratinocytes in the skin to downregulate their differentiation;17 and to induce T-cell chemoattractants that mediate T cell infiltration into AD lesions.18 • Il-13 may induce IL-5 expression and eosinophil infiltration through the induction of eosinophil chemoattractants.19 • IL-13 can reduce epithelial integrity through the downregulation of filaggrin, loricrin, and involucrin.20 • IL-13 can mediate fibrosis through the induction of collagen production in fibroblasts.21 • In an epi-cutaneous ovalbumin sensitization model of murine AD, topical anti-sense oligonucleotides targeting mouse IL-13 mRNA were shown to significantly reduce the production of IL-13 in the skin and in turn significantly reduce inflammation.22 • Increased IL-13 has been reported in the serum of AD patients16 and several studies have reported an increase in IL-13 expressing T cells in the blood of AD patients.23-25 • Increased expression of IL-13 in AD skin has been reported.26-31 • Increased levels of IL-13 have been observed in AD skin lesions and reports suggest a relationship between IL-13 expression and the severity of disease.25 • Clinical studies investigating agents with broadly acting anti-inflammatory activity demonstrated that reduced IL-13 expression was associated with clinical improvement. 32-34"

Study randomization will occur across study sites. After written informed consent has been obtained, all patients will receive a six-digit screening number (XXX-XXX = site number-patient number), assigned in EDC (via iMedidata Rave in sequential order), which will be assigned by the site. Sites should assign the patient numbers in the order that they are screened and enter patients in EDC in the same order. Following completion of the screening period, and after all patient eligibility requirements are confirmed on Day 1 (Baseline) , the patient’s screening number will be entered in the IWRS, and the patient will be assigned a patient study-drug kit. One kit will provide all the study drug for that patient based on the assigned treatment group. Patients will be randomized 3:3:3:2 to one of the following treatment groups. The dosing schedule by treatment group is shown in Table 1 . Treatment Group 1: Lebrikizumab, 125 mg every 4 weeks Baseline: Loading dose of 250 mg (two injections of 1 mL of 125 mg/mL drug product and two injections of 1 mL placebo); Week 2: Four 1-mL injections of placebo Weeks 4, 8, 12: 125 mg (one 1-mL injection of 125 mg/mL drug product and one 1-mL injection of placebo) Week 6, 10, 14: Two 1-mL injections of placebo Treatment Group 2: Lebrikizumab, 250 mg every 4 weeks Baseline: Loading dose of 500 mg (four 1-mL injections of 125 mg/mL drug product) Week 2: Four 1-mL injections of placebo Weeks 4, 8, 12: 250 mg (two 1-mL injections of 125 mg/mL drug product); Week 6, 10, 14: Two 1-mL injections of placebo Treatment Group 3 : Lebrikizumab, 250 mg every 2 weeks Baseline and Week 2: Loading dose of 500 mg (four 1-mL injections of 125 mg/mL drug product) Week 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14: 250 mg (two 1-mL injections of 125 mg/mL drug product) Treatment Group 4: Placebo every 2 weeks Baseline and Week 2: Placebo (four 1-mL injections of placebo) Week 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 : Two 1-mL injections of placebo"

Study drug should be prepared in advance and injected subcutaneously according to the following instructions: • Remove study drug from refrigerated condition and allow to warm to room temperature for 15 minutes prior to administration. Study drug should be administered within 4 hours. • Identify location for injections. Study drug may be injected in the abdomen, upper arm, or thigh. All injections administered at a single visit should be given in the same area, but may be split up into different areas for Week 0 and Week 2, which have 4 injections/visit. Injection sites should be ≥10 cm from one another. If possible, injections should not be administered at sites with active AD or other skin lesions. • Inject study drug subcutaneously. • Record location of study injections in the eCRF. • Properly dispose of used syringe according to site requirements. Syringe box must be kept for full drug accountability. 6.8 Concomitant Medications and Procedures All medications (includ ing over-the-counter dru g s, vitamins, and antacids) and over-the-counter emollient(s) taken/used at screening and throughout the study must be recorded. The sponsor will provide the patient with an over-the-counter emollient. The patient may continue her/his current over-the-counter emolli ent regimen, if approved by the Investigator. All medications and treatments taken for AD prior to screening will be recorded separately on an AD medication-history eCRF. Patients should be instructed to consult with the Investigator prior to initiating any new medication (either self-administered non-prescription drugs or prescription therapy prescribed by another physician) while participating in the st udy. The Investigator is expected to examine the acceptability of all concomitant medications, topical preparations, and dietary supplements taken by patients participating in the trial. • Medication entries should be specific to product name (if a combination drug product) and spelled correctly. • The brand and specific product name for any over-the-counter emollient(s) should be noted and spelled correctly. • Information on the dose, unit, frequency, route of administration, start date, discontinuation date, indication, and reason for use will be recorded."

Extensive information on the patient’s atopic dermatitis, asthma, and allergies will be collected as part of the medical history. The medical history will be updated prior to treatment on Baseline/Day 1 should new findings be present since the screening visit. Findings will be recorded in the eCRF. 8.1.3 Disease Specific Information Information on the patie nt’s atopic dermatitis will be colle cted as part of the screening assessment and include the date of onset of atop ic dermatitis, anatomical areas affected by atopic dermatitis, and past treatments for atopic dermatitis. Information will be recorded in the eCRF. 8.2 Assessment of Efficacy 8.2.1 AD Assessments Each patient ’s AD will be assessed a s specified in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures. Whenever possible, the same assessor should perform all assessments on a given patient. Individuals will be trained and certified by the Sponsor prior to conducting any assessments. 8.2.1.1 Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) The IGA ( Appendix 3 ) is an instrument used to globally rate the severity of the patient’s AD and is based on a 5-point scale ranging f rom 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). The IGA must be conducted prior to conducting the EASI assessment."

Assessors must be trained and certified by the Sponsor prior to conducting this assessment. Assessments will be recorded in the eCRF. 8.2.1.2 Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) The EASI ( Appendix 4 ) is used to assess the severity and extent of AD; it is a composite index with scores ranging fro m 0 to 72, with the higher values indicating more severe and or extensive disease. A grade of 0 to 72 will be assessed by the Investigator or designee. Assessors must be trained and certified by the Sponsor prior to conducting this assessment. Assessments will be recorded in the eCRF. 8.2.1.3 Body Surface Area (BSA) The BSA ( Appendix 5 ) assessment estimates the extent of disease or skin involveme nt with respect to AD and is expressed as a percentage of total body surface. BSA will be determined by the Investigator or designee using the patient palm = 1% rule. Assessments will be recorded in the eCRF. Assessors must be trained and certified by the Sponsor prior to conducting this assessment. 8.2.1.4 Pruritus Pruritus will be assessed by the patient using a Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) ( Appendix 6 ). The Pruritus NRS is an 11-point scale used by patients to assess their worst itch severity over the past 24 hours with 0 indicating “No itch” and 10 indicating “Worst itch imaginable”. At Week 16, a global impression of change for itching question will be requested. Assessments will be recorded daily by the patient using an electronic diary and transferred into the clinical database. 8.2.1.5 Sleep-Loss Quality of sleep will be assessed by the patient u s ing a sleep-loss question ( Appendix 7 ) over the past 24 hours. Assessments will be recorded daily by the patient using an electronic diary and transferred into the clinical database. 8.2.1.6 Atopic Dermatitis Impact Questionnaire (ADIQ) The ADIQ ( Appendix 8 ) is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the p atients’ AD-specific health-related QoL. The questionnaire assesses AD’s impact on emotions, energy, activities of daily living, and social activities. The ADIQ has a recall specification of 7 days. Assessments will be recorded by the patient using an electronic diary and transferred into the clinical database. 8.2.1.7 Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) The POEM ( Appendix 9 ) is a 7-item questionnaire used by the patient to assess the severity of the patient’s eczema over the last week. All seven answers carry equal weight and are scored as: No days=0; 1‒ 2 days =1; 3 ‒4 days=2; 5 ‒6 days=3; everyday=4. The POEM is completed by the patient in the cl inic.

The 10 questions cover the following topics: symptoms, embarrassment, shopping and home care, clothes, social and leisure, sport, work or study, close relationships, sex, and treatment, over the previous week. Questions are scored from 0 to 3, giving a possible total score range from 0 (meaning no impact of skin disease on quality of life) to 30 (meaning maximum impact on quality of life). The DLQI is completed by the patient in the study clinic. Assessments will be recorded in the eCRF. 8.2.1.9 Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) The HADS ( Appendix 11 ) assesse s anxiety and depression in a non-psychiatric po pulation. The HADS has two subscales (depression and anxiety), both with 7 questions. Responses are based on the relative frequency of symptoms over the past week, using a four-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very often indeed). HADS is completed by the patient in the clinic. Assessments will be recorded in the eCRF. 8.2.1.10 Global Assessment of Change–AD The Global Assessment of Change for AD ( Appendix 12 ) will be one question asked a t Week 16 and the Early-Terminatio n visit. The value of the question is t o capture the patient’s impression of overall change in their AD. This will be completed by the patient in the clinic. Assessments will be recorded in the eCRF 8.2.2 PK and ADA Sampling Serum PK and ADA samples on Day 1, 15, 29, 57 (PK only), 85 (PK only), 113, and 169 will be taken predose. PK and ADA sample s will be co llected from all patients including those assigned to the placebo group to maintain the blinding of the treatment assignment. Positive ADA results will be further evaluated for antidrug antibodies. The procedural instructions will be provided in a separate PK and Serum Antibody Sampling manual. 9 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 9.1 Assessment of Safety 9.1.1 Physical Examination A complete physical examination will be conduct ed at screening and cover general a ppearance, dermatological, head, e ars, eyes, nose, throat, respiratory, cardiovascular, abdominal, neurological, musculoskeletal, and lymphatic body systems. Height and weight will be recorded as part of the screening physical exam and only the patient’s weight will be recorded with the Baseline and the week 16 physical examination. Findings will be recorded in the eCRF. At subsequent study visits, a symptom-directed physical examination may be conducted. 9.1.2 Vital Signs Vital signs, including body temperature, respirat ory rate (breath per minute), pulse (b eats per minute), and blood pressure (mmHg), will be obtained with the patient in the seated position,"

Any abnormal findings which are new or worsened in severity and clinically significant, in the opinion of the Investigator, will be recorded as an AE. Vital sign measurements will be recorded in the eCRF. 9.1.3 ECGs 12-lead ECG measurements will be obtained i n all patient s. The patient should rest quietly for at least 5 minutes in a supine position prior to ECG collection. The ECG should be obtained either prior to the time of blood collection, or at least 15 minutes afterwards. The medical monitor may be consulted if needed for interpretation of ECGs. All study sites will be supplied with standardized, validated, digital, 12-lead ECG machine (12-lead at 25 mm/sec reporting rhythm, ventricular rate, the RR interval, the PR interval, QRS duration, QT and QTcF intervals) capable of recording, storing, printing, and producing high resolution 12-lead ECG data. Study sites will be trained on the use of the equipment prior to study start. Machine-read ECG recordings will be collected and analyzed centrally. Data will be transferred electronically to the database. 9.1.4 Laboratory Evaluations Laboratory tests will be analyzed using a central laboratory and include h ematology with differential, serology, a standard chemistry panel (including liver-function tests), total cholesterol, standard urine testing, and urine pregnancy test for women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP). Blood and urine will be collected from each patient as specified in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures or as clinically indicated. Laboratory samples are to be shipped on the same day as collected. Laboratory test results will be provided to the sites through a web-based reporting system. Alert values will be emailed to the site. Laboratory data will be transferred to the clinical database from the central laboratory database. Screening laboratory test results must be reviewed by the Investigator prior to patient enrollment. Patients will fail screening for clinically significant laboratory values. However, at the discretion of the Investigator, screening laboratory tests may be repeated one time to confirm out-of-range results or clinical significance. Specific laboratory tests are listed in Table 2. The central laboratory should be use d for all laboratory testing required f or a patient during study participation, including laboratory testing needed for unscheduled visits. Clinically significant laboratory results must be entered as a diagnosis on the AE eCRF rather than as an individual test result. Patients with clinically significant laboratory test results will be evaluated, treated and followed at the discretion of the Investigator until the value returns to clinically acceptable levels. Throughout the study, all laboratory results should be reviewed and signed by the Investigator within 48 hours of receipt of the report (whenever possible)."

An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of the study drug, whether related to the investigational product. AEs will be monitored throughout the study. Patients will be instructed to inform the Investigator and/or study staff of any AEs. At each visit, patients will be asked about AEs in a non-specific manner using open-ended questions so as not to bias the response (e.g., How have you been since the last visit?). Specific inquiry regarding reported AEs will be conducted when applicable. All AEs will be documented and recorded in the patient’s eCRF. Any patient who has an AE (serious or non-serious) will be evaluated by the Investigator and treated and followed until the symptom(s) return to normal or to clinically acceptable levels, as judged by the Investigator. A physician, either at clinical site, or at a nearby hospital emergency room, will administer treatment for any serious AEs (SAEs), if necessary. When appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be perform ed to document resolution of event(s)."

Events recorded prio r to study treatment with the drug will be reported in t he Medical History section of the eCRF. All AEs occurring during the study will be individually recorded in the eCRF. Any condition present prior to administration of study drug and that worsens after administration of study drug should be reported as an AE. Information regarding the onset, duration, severity, action taken, outcome, and relationship to study drug will be recorded. New or worsening abnormal laboratory values and/or vital signs are to be recorded as AEs if they are considered to be of clinical significance by the Investigator or meet the criteria of an SAE as described in Section 9.1.6. Unless a diagnosis is available, signs and symptoms must be reported as individual AEs in the eCRF; a diagnosis is preferred. The severity of an AE will be designa ted as mild, moderate or severe. The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of an AE; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor clinical significance (e.g., ‘severe’ upper respiratory infect ion). Severity is not the same as “serious”. Seriousness of AEs is based on the outcome/action of an AE. (See Section 9.1.6.) The relationship of the AE to the stu dy treatment should be determined by the Investigator and will be based on the following two definitions: Not related: The AE is judged to not be associated with the study drug, and is attributable to another cause. Related: A causal relationship between the AE and the study drug is a reasonable possibility, i.e., there is evidence (e.g., dechallenge/rechallenge) or other clinical arguments to suggest a causal relationship between the AE and study treatment. 9.1.6 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, • Results in d eath • Is in the opinion of the Investigator immediately life threatening (i.e., the patient is at immediate risk of death; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death) • Requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization • Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity • Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect • Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life-threatening, result in death, or require hospitalization, but based on appropriate medical judgment, it jeopardizes the patient, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed. The Investigator should institute any clinically necessary supplementary investigation of SAE information. In the case of patient death, any post-mortem findings/reports will be requested."
36,page_36,"Dermira, Inc. Lebrikizumab DRM06-AD01-A2 Protocol: DRM06-AD01_A2 Page 36 Confidential 9.1.6.1 Reporting of SAEs All SAEs, as defined in Section 9.1.6, regardless of causal re lationship, must be repor ted to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event. As soon as the Investigator becomes aware of an AE that meets the criteria for an SAE, the SAE should be documented to the extent that information is available. SAEs will be recorded from the time of informed consent/assent until the end of the study. If, in the opinion of the Investigator, an SAE occurring outside the specified time window (i.e., following patient completion or terminations of the study) is deemed to be drug-related, the event should be reported with 24 hours. SAEs must be recorded on an SAE form. The minimum information required for SAE reporting includes the identity of the PI, site number, patient number, event description, SAE term(s), reason why the event is considered serious (i.e., the seriousness criteria), and PI’s assessment of the relationship of the event to study drug. Additional SAE information including medications or other therapeutic measures used to treat the event, and the outcome/resolution of the event should also be recorded on the SAE form. In all cases, the Investigator should continue to monitor the clinical situation and report all material facts relating to the progression or outcome of the SAE. The Investigator may be required to provide supplementary information as requested by the Sponsor or its designee. When reporting SAEs, the following additional points should be considered: • Although signs, symptoms, and tests that support the diagnosis of an SAE should be provided, the Investigator should report t he diagnosis or syndrome as the SAE term. • Death should not be reported as an SAE, but as an outcome of a specific SAE (unless the event preceding the death is unknown). If an autopsy was performed, the autopsy report should be provided. Although most hospitalizations necessitate report ing of an SAE, some hospitalizations do not: • Hospitalization for elective or previously scheduled surgery, or for a procedure for a pre- existing condition that has not worsened after administration of study drug (e.g., a previously scheduled ventral hernia repair). SAEs must, however, be reported for any surgical or procedural complication that lead to prolongation of the hospitalization. • Events that result in hospital stays for observation of <24 hours and that do not require a therapeutic intervention/treatment (e.g., an emergency room visit for hematuria that results in a diagnosis of cystitis and discharge to home on oral antibiotics). The Sponsor will process and evaluate all SAEs as soon as the reports are received. For each SAE received, the Sponsor will determine whether the criteria for expedited reporting to relevant regulatory authorities have been met. The Sponsor will assess the likel ihood that each SAE is related to study treatment, with the current Investigator’s Brochure used as the reference document to assess expectedness of the event to study drug. 9.1.7 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) AESIs in this study include: • Anaphylactic reactions or acute alle rgic reactions that require immediate treatment • Malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers)."

The Investigator must perform medical assessments as clinically i ndicated and continue to follow the patient for ≥4 weeks after delivery, at a minimum. Details for both the mother and baby must be obtained. Although pregnancy is not itself an AE or SAE, mater nal/fetal complications or abnormalities will be recorded as AEs or SAEs, as appropriate. The Investigator must complete a study-specific Pregnancy Form upon confirmation of a pregnancy. Pregnancy reporting forms will be provided to the site. 10 STUDY DISCONTINUATIONS 10.1 Study Termination The Sponsor has the right to terminate or to stop the study at any time. Sh ould the stu dy be terminated, the decision and reason will be communicated in writing by the Sponsor to the Investigator and request that all patients be discontinued. Should this be necessary, patients should be scheduled for an Early-termination visit (Section 7.4). The entire st udy will be stopped if: • Evidence has emerged that, in the collective opinion of the I nvestigators at each site with the concurrence of the Sponsor, or the sole opinion of the Sponsor, continuation of the study is unnecessary or unethical • The stated objectives of the study are achieved • The Sponsor discontinues the development of the study drug If the study is terminated by the Sponsor, all data available for the patient at the time of discontinuation must be recorded in the patient’s records and the eCRF. 10.2 Early Termination of Study Patients The Investigator will make every reas onable effort to keep each patient in t he study. However, patients may terminate or be terminated early from the study for the following reasons: • Voluntarily withdrawal of consent to participate in the study participation, at any time • Adverse event, laboratory abnormality or inter-current illness which, in the opinion of the Investigator, indicates that continued treatment and/or participation in the study is not in the best interest of the patient • Serious protocol violation, persistent non-compliance or requirement for medication or procedure prohibited by the protocol • Lost to follow-up Patients who are terminated early from study will have an Early-Termination visit scheduled (Section 7.4) as soon as possible . All information, including t he reason fo r early discontinuation will be recorded in the patient’s study records and in the eCRF. Before a patient can be terminated early due to loss of follow-up, the Investigator must show documented attempts to contact the patient regarding study participation on two separate occasions (telephone contact) followed by a certified letter of contact."

No interim analyses are planned. Except where noted, all statistical tests will be two-sided and will be performed at the 0.05 level of significance. The inclusion of p-values in the efficacy analyses is to assist in characterizing the therapeutic efficacy of the active medication. No adjustments will be made for multiple comparisons for the efficacy analyses. The prim ary analysis will be performed when all patients have completed the treatment phase at Week 16. The final time-course data analysis will be performed when all patients have finished Week 32. Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an overview of the efficacy and safety results. For categorical parameters, the number and percentage of patients in each category will be presented. The denominator for percentage will be based on the number of patients appropriate for the analysis. For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics will include the number of patients (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, and range. Appropriate inferential statistics will be used for the primary and secondary efficacy variables. For the primary efficacy variable, the primary method of handling missing efficacy data will be the method of MCMC multiple imputation. This method does not rely on the assumption of data missing at random. Additionally, imputation will be conducted within each treatment group independently so the pattern of missing observations in one treatment group cannot influence missing value estimations in another. For binary responses related to EASI and IGA, t he binary response variables will be calculated based on the multiply imputed datasets that have been created. Because the MCMC algorithm is based on the multivariate normal model, imputed values for IGA will not generally be one of the discrete values used in IGA scoring (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4). Therefore, to derive the binary IGA response variable, standard rounding rules will be applied to the imputed values. For example, if a patient has a IGA score imputed as 1.4 (and assuming a Baseline IGA score of 3), the imputed value would be rounded down to 1, and the minimum change from Baseline of 2 would have been met. This patient would be considered a responder."
39,page_39,"Dermira, Inc. Lebrikizumab DRM06-AD01-A2 Protocol: DRM06-AD01_A2 Page 39 Confidential For derivation of EASI75 response, no rounding will be performed. The imputed Week 16 EASI value will be compared directly to the observed Baseline EASI value to determine whether a reduction of at least 75% was achieved. For the EASI assessment, a total of 4 seeds are required to impute the EASI score for the four treatment groups. Those 4 random seeds have been pre-specified by using a random number generator: Lebrikizumab, 125 mg every 4 weeks: seed = 1083679005 Lebrikizumab, 250 mg every 4 weeks: seed = 1346533179 Lebrikizumab, 250 mg every 2 weeks: seed = 297484487 Placebo every 2 weeks: seed = 424603513 For the IGA assessment, a total of 4 seeds are required to impute the IGA score for the four treatment groups. Those 4 random seeds have been pre-specified by using a random number generator: Lebrikizumab, 125 mg every 4 weeks: seed = 1975600090 Lebrikizumab, 250 mg every 4 weeks: seed = 1260832817 Lebrikizumab, 250 mg every 2 weeks: seed = 2036512379 Placebo every 2 weeks: seed = 202520365 Sensitivity analyses on some of the secondary efficacy variables will be performed as follows: • Non-response imputation (NRI) will be used to impute missing values. Specifically, any patient with a missing IGA (or EASI75) value at Week 16 will be treated as a non-responder for analysis purposes. • Demographic data will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics. Patients’ baseline characteristics related to efficacy analyses will be compared with descriptive statistics among treatment groups to determine whether the results are directly comparable. • The number of patients in each analysis set will be summarized. Reasons for study withdrawal during the blinded study will be summarized using frequencies and percentages by treatment group. A statistical analysis plan (SAP) describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate document. The SAP will be finalized prior to unblinding of the treatment groups. 11.2 Populations Analyzed Patients will be randomized in a 3:3:3:2 ratio to ea ch treatment group. There will be approximate ly 75 patients for groups with study drug, and 50 patients for the placebo group. Efficacy analyses will be performed using the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population and the per-protocol (PP) population. The mITT population will include all patients who were randomized and received study drug. The PP population will include all patients in the safety population who completed the Week 16 evaluation without any significant protocol violations (i.e., any patient or Investigator activity that could have possibly interfered with the therapeutic administration of the treatment or the precise evaluation of treatment efficacy). Safety analyses will be performed using the safety population. All patients who are randomized and receive ≥ 1 dose of study drug will be included in the safety population."

The planned PK analysis will be included in a separate Pharmacokinetic Analysis Plan. 11.6 Exposure and Compliance The extent of exposure to study drug in each treatment group will be summarized by total number of days of exposure, total n umber of application s, number of missed applications, and number and percentage of patients who are compliant. An application is considered the full set of injections (either 2 or 4 depending on visit) specified by the protocol. A patient will be considered compliant with the dosing regimen if the patient received ≥75% of the expected number of applications while enrolled in the study. 11.7 Adverse Events All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and cod ed using the MedDRA dictionary. Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs with an onset date on or after the date of the first application. TEAEs will be summarized by treatment group, including the number of patients reporting an event, system organ class, pr eferred term, severity, relationship to study drug, and seriousness for the safety population. All serious AEs as well as AEs that led to study discontinuation will be listed by patient."

Lebrikizumab DRM06-AD01_A2 Protocol: DRM06-AD01_A2 Page 62 Confidential DERMATOLOGY LIFE QUALITY INDEX (DLQI) – INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE The Dermatology Life Quality Index questionnaire is designed for use in adults, i.e. patients over the age of 16. It is self-explanatory and can be simply handed to the patient who is asked to fill it in without the need for detailed explanation. It is usually completed in one or two minutes. SCORING The scoring of each question is as follows: Very much Scored 3 A lot Scored 2 A little Scored 1 Not at all Scored 0 Not relevant Scored 0 Question 7, ‘prevented work or studying’ Scored 3 The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. HOW TO INTERPRET MEANING OF DLQI SCORES 0–1 No effect at all on patient's life 2–5 Small effect on patient's life 6–10 Moderate effect on patient's life 11–20 Very large effect on patient's life 21–30 Extremely large e ffect on patient's life REFERENCES Finlay AY and Khan GK.
