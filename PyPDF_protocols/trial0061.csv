SYNOPSIS Protocol Title: A 28 -week, randomized, dou ble-blind, placebo -controlled, parallel - group, multi -center, study inrhEPO naïve non -dialy sis participants with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease to evaluate the efficacy , safet y and effects on quality of life of daprodustat compared to placeb o. Short Title: Anemia Studies in CKD: Erythropoiesis via a Novel PHI Daprodustat in Non-Dialysis participants evaluating Hemoglobin and Quality of life (ASCEND -NHQ) Rationale: Daprodustat (GSK1278863) is a hy poxia -inducible factor prol yl hydroxy lase inhib itor (HIF -PHI) currently being investigated as a treatment for anemia associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in both dialy sis and non -dialy sis participants. Blood hemoglobin ( Hgb)concentration, transferrin saturation and ferritin levels are the prim ary markers for evaluation of anemia in CKD patients. I nitiall y, non -dialy sis CKD patients receive iron therapy , to ensure that sufficient iron is available for ery thropoiesis prior to initiating therap y with recombinant human ery thropoietin (rhEPO) for an emia. A one to three month trial of oral iron is generall y recommended in rhEPO naïve patients with non -dialy sis CKD. However, if poor compliance is seen with oral iron therapy due to lack of efficacy or gastrointestinal intolerance, IV iron may be adminis tered in patients requiring iron repletion. rhEPO therap y is generally initiated in non -dialysisCKD patients once Hgb has dropped below 10 g/dL at which stage benefits outweigh the ris ks associated with this therapy . Thus, the question arises whether init iation of treatment with a PHI, such as daprodustat, in the rhEPO naïve and iron sufficient population might result in Hgb benefits that are reflected as benefits in symptoms and quality of life. This Phase 3 double blind study will be conducted to assess efficacy , safety and effects on quality -of-life of daprodustat compared to placebo. Study participants will be rhEPO naïve and had limited IV iron exposure at baseline. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of daprodustat, on hemoglobin respo nse and quality of life, compared to placebo over 28 weeks .. The primary endpoint is Hgb superiority of daprodustat versus placebo, and a principal secondary endpoint includes measures of health related quality - of-life."
10,page_10,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 11Objectives and Endpoints : Objec tive Endpoint Primary To compare the efficacy of daprodustat to placebo on mean change in Hgb levels Mean change in Hgb between b aseline and the Evaluation Period (EP, mean over Week 24 to Week 28) Principal Secondary To compare the proportion of par ticipants achieving increases in Hgb when treated with daprodustat versus placebo. % of participants having a Hgb increase of ≥1.0 g/dL to EP. To compare daprodustat to placebo for health related quality -of-lifeMean Change in 36-item Short Form health survey (SF -36) Vitality domain , between baseline and Week 28 Safety  To compare t he safety and tolerability of daprodustat to placeboIncidence and severity of adverse events (AEs)and serious adverse events (SAEs) including AEs of special interest and adjudicated Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE ) (composite of all -cause morta lity, non -fatal MI and non -fatal stroke) Reasons for discontinuation of study treatment Absolute values and changes from baseline in laboratory parameters, blood pressure ( BP)and heart rate (HR) Overall Design: This is a 28 -week, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multi - center Phase 3 study in participants with anemia associat ed with CKD who are not on dialy sis. This study will enroll participants with renal anemia who have a HemoCue Hgb 8.5to 10.0 g/dL, inclusive , as measure d by a point -of-care Hgb anal yser (HemoCue) . These participants will also have limited history of IV iron use and are rhEPO naïve prior to screening and randomization. Study treatment doses for participants in both treatment arms will be titrated based up on HemoCue Hgb. Dose modifications for all participants will follow a protocol -specified dose adjustment algorithm to achieve and maintain Hgb within the target range of 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL, inclusive. Dose changes will be made programmaticall y by the Inter active Response Technology (IRT)system for both randomized treatment arms."
11,page_11,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 12A rescue algorithm is provided to minimize participants having an inadequate response to treatment of their anemia after a fixed period of time and to enable rescue therap y to be provided to the participants based on lo cal clinical practice. A Clinical Events Committee (CEC) will adjudicate an y event suspected to be a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). Number of Participant s: Approximately 1200 participants will be screened to achieve approximately 600 randomized and approximately 540 evaluable participants for an estimated total of 270 evaluable participants per treatment arm . Treatment Groups and Duration: Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either daprodustat or matching placebo tablets, administered once daily . This study includes a 4 -week Screening period, a 28 -week Treatment period, and a 4 - week Follow -up period. The total duration of study participation for each participant will be approximately 36 weeks."

Stud y Rationale Daprodustat (GSK1278863) is a hy poxia-inducible factor prol yl hydroxy lase inhibitor (HIF -PHI) currently being investigated as a treatment for anemia associated with chronic kidney disease ( CKD )in both dialy sis and non -dialy sis participants with s afety and efficacy having been demonstrated in clinical trials up to 24 weeks duration. Both pre - clinical and clinical data show that daprodustat -stimulated ery thropoietin (EPO) production ,increase serythropoiesis and thus elevat eshemoglobin ( Hgb)concentrations. These increases in Hgb are achi eved with peak plasma EPO exposures substantially lower than those observed with r ecombinant human EPO (rhEPO) . Data from completed clinical and preclinical studies are provided in the current Investigator Brochure [IB GlaxoSmithKline Document number RM2008/00267/07 ]and IB supplement(s). Daprodustat has been evaluated as a treatment for anemia associated with CKD in non - dialy sis participants . A Phase 2 Aclinical trial in non-dialy sis participants with anemia associated with CKD demonstr ated that fixed -dose daprodustat was better than placebo in increasing Hgb over 4 weeks [Holdstock , 2016 ]. Another Phase 2B, randomized, controlled 24 -week parallel -group, multi -center study also evaluated daprodus tat safet y and efficacy in a non -dialysis population that were either naïve o r previously treated with rhEPO [GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2014N219818_00 ]. Titration of daprodustat demonstrated efficacy byachieving mean Hgb within target range with an adverse event rate consistent with the clinical events that generall y occur in the CKD population. Blood Hgbconcentration , transferrin saturation and ferritin levels are the primary markers forevaluation of anemia in CKD patients. Initially, non -dialysis CKD patients receive iron therap y, to ensure that sufficient iron is available for ery thropoiesis prior to initiating rhEPO therap y for anemia treatment. A one to three month trial of oral iron is generall y recommended in rhEPO naïve patients with non -dialy sis CKD [KDIGO ,2012 ). However, if poor compliance is seen with oral iron therap y due to lack of efficacy or gastrointestinal intolerance, IV iron may be administered i n patients requiring iron repletion. rhEPO therap yis generall y initiated in non -dialy sisCKDpatients once Hgb has dropped below 10 g/dL andbenefits outweigh the risks associated with this therapy [KDIGO,2012] .Thus ,the question arises whether initiation of treatment with a PHI , such as daprodustat ,in the rhEPO naïve and iron sufficient population might result in Hgb benefits t hat are reflected as benefits in symptoms and quality of life. This Phase 3 double blind study will be conducted to assess efficacy , safety and effects on quality -of-life of daprodustat compared to placebo .Study participants will be rhEPO naïve and had limited IV iron exposure at baseline . The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect o f daprodustat, on hemoglobin response and quality of life , compared to placebo over anextended period , i.e. 28 weeks, unlike the the previous study which evaluated the response over 4 weeks .The primary endpoint is Hgb superiority of daprodu statversus placebo, and a principal secondary endpoint include smeasures of health related quality -of-life."
18,page_18,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 193.2. Background Anemia is a common complication of CKD . The cause of anemia in this population is multi-factorial, including relative or absolute deficiency of EPO , reduced iron availability related to chronic inflammation or acute infection, and gastrointestinal blood loss. Anemia is further exacerbated b y shortened erythrocyte survival that is associated with the uremic milieu and declining kidney function. Current treatments for anemia associated with CKD include supple mental iron therap y (IVor oral), the use of rhEPO, and blood transfusions. While existing therapies are useful and effective in treating anemia, they each have significant limitations. Thus ,an unme t need exists for a safer alternative for treatment of anemia associated with CKD. 3.3. Benefit/Risk A ssessment More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonabl y expected adverse events of daprodustat may be found in the daprodustat IB andIB suppleme nts (if applicable). Specific information regarding warnings, precautions, contraindications, adverse events (AEs), and other pertinent information on the randomized treatment is provided in the IB, IB supplement(s) (if applicable) and other pertinent docu ments (e.g., Study Reference Manual [ SRM ], informed consent). 3.3.1. Risk A ssessment The potential risks of clinical significance including AEs of special interest (Section 9.3.7 ), and the mitigation strategies for thi s protocol taking into account the results of completed clinical and nonclinical studies with daprodustat, are outlined below .

In the phase 2 proof of concept study, a high incidence of discontinuation due to hemoglobin stopping criteria (Hgb > 13.5 g/dL or Hgb increased > 1 g/dL over any 2 -week period) was observed. In non-dialysis participant s administered 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg or 1 00 mg of daprodustat daily, a total of 21 of 61 participant s(34% ) met these criteria. In hemodialysis -dependent participant sadministered either 10 mg or 25 mg of daprodustat daily, a total of 8 of 31 participant s(26% ) met these criteria. Phase 2 dose -ranging studies, and associated statistical and exposure response modelling has informed Phase 3 dose rationale, starting doses, dose steps, and dose adjustment scheme to optimize Hgb management.

The small number of events makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusions.

Acute hypoxic challenge (rats): Daprodustat produced increases in peak right ventricular pre ssure (PRVP) during acute hypoxia that were slightly higher than the vehicle control group. These hypoxia -induced PRVP changes fall within the range of PRVP differences noted among non-treated rats. Results from a clinical study of acute hypoxic challenge in healthy volunteers demonstrated that short -term (5 days) therapy with daprodustat 5mg or 100mg ha dno clinically significant effect on transthoracic echocardiographic (ECHO) estimate s ofsystolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) under either normoxic o r hypoxic conditions. ECHO assessments performed in Phase 2b studies (24 weeks treatment duration) did not identify any clinically meaningful changes in sPAP in participants not on dialysis for daprodustat. In hemodialysis participants , mean absolute chang e from baseline in sPAP was similar for both treatment groups; however, there was a numeric imbalance (Daprodustat: 8 [7%]; Control 0) in participants reaching the sPAP PCI (>20 mmHg increase from baseline). Regarding this imbalance, there were a number of confounding factors in the study, most notably a 4.5:1 randomization scheme and inconsistency in timing of ECHOs relative to dialysis day. Additionally, 2 of 3 participants with resolution of sPAP on safety follow -up ECHOs had confounding conditions that could contribute to resolution other than discontinuation of study treatment; and there was no dose relationship for participants meeting the sPAP PCI criterion. Overall, there is insufficient evidence to conclude a relationship to treatment with daprodus tat. A post -hoc analysis was performed using a definition of PAH often cited in the literature [Navaneethan , 2016]. participant swith sPAP >35 mmHg and/or tricuspid regurgitation maximum jet velocity (TRV) >2.5 m/s were considered as having"

Drug -drug interactions Daprodustat is a substrate of CYP2C8 : Co-administration of daprodustat with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor (gemfibrozil )increased the Cmax and AUC of daprodustat, 4 -and 19 -fold, respectively, while co - administration of a weak inhibitor (trimethoprim )increased the Cmax and AUC of daprodustat by 1.3 -and 1.5 -fold, respectively. Although CYP2C8 induction studies were not performed, co -admin istration of daprodustat with an inducer of CYP2C8 may decrease the exposure of daprodustat. Population PK analysis from completed Phase 2 studies suggests that co-administration of daprodustat with a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor (clopidogrel) , leads to a ~ 2-fold increase in AUC, with no clinically - significant increase in the measured Hgb response. Daprodustat is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro, with an IC 50value of 21 µM. Population PK analysis from Phase 2 studies suggested that while BCRP inhibitors were a covariate for daprodustat CL/F (8.6% lower clearance) the predicted change in exposure was not considered to be of clinical relevance. Co-administration of daprodustat with BCRP inhibitors [e.g., cyclosporine, HIV antivirals (atazanavir, lopinavir, ritonavir, tipranavir), lapatanib and curcumin] ] is not expected to produce clinically relevant increases in daprodustat exposure Daprodustat is an inhibitor of OATP1B1/1B3 in vitro, with IC 50values  Co-administration of daprodustat with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) and inducers (e .g., rifampin/rifampicin) is not permitted as outlined in Section 7.8.2 . Co-administration of daprodustat with moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (i.e., clopidogrel, teriflunomide, deferasirox) should be performed with caution.

Cyst progression in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)Published data provide in vivo evidence for a potential role of HIF -1a in the growth of polycystic kidneys; Hif -1a deletion was sufficient to significantly mitigate a progressive polycystic phenotype in an ADPKD mouse model, while conversely pharmacologic HIF -1a stabilization was sufficient to convert a mild polycystic disease into a severely aggravated phenotype with marked loss of renal function. However, the dose of FG -2216 (a PHI) used resulted in a significant erythropoietic response as reflected by ≥10% relative increases in hematocrit ove r the course of the study (Kraus , 2018; Hofherr , 2018). A review of the non -clinical data from toxicity studies conducted with daprodustat does not indicate an exacerbation in i ncidence or severity of kidney cysts in daprodustat -treated animals in comparison to controls. However, the wild type animals used in these toxicity studies have a very low background incidence of renal cysts and are not comparable to the mice used in the Kraus article ( Kraus , 2018) which are an inducible kidney epithelium -specific Pkd1 -deletion model. There is limited experience with daprodustat in participants with ADPKD in completed clinical trials. In the Japan ph ase 3 study in non - dialysis participants , there were 5 participants with ADPKD (all CKD stage 5) in each treatment group.

This study may be beneficial to study participants by allowing participants access to anemia manage ment and CKD care. Study participants will benefit from routine medical visits to the site and eas y access to clinical facilities geared towards t reatment of anemia in CKD. Study participants will also benefit from potentially obtaining a treatment for anemia in the form of an oral tablet which increases the ease of use for patients and health care providers. After administration of daprodustat, data suggest that the increases in Hgb are achieved with EPO exposure lower than those observed with rhEPOs. 3.3.3. Overall Benefit:Risk Conclusion Daprodustat demonstrates a positive benefit vs. risk based on the evidence as follows. In clinical trials up to 24 weeks in duration in non -dialy sis CKD participants, daprodustat treats Hgb to target range, with a safet y profile consistent with the patient population. Furthermore, t his protocol employ s precautions to mitigate known and potential risks to randomized participants (Section 3.3.1 ). Given these precautions, as well as the potential benefit that daprodustat holds for the treatment of anemia associated with CKD compared to the current standard, the overall benefit risk balance is considered to be positive. 4.

STUDY DESIGN 5.1. Overall Design This is a 28-week, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multi - center Phase 3 study in participants with anemia associated with chronic ki dney disease (CKD) who are not on dialy sis. This study will enroll anemic participants who have a HemoCue Hgb 8.5to 10.0 g/dL, inclusive. These participants will have limited history of IV iron and be rhEPO naïve prior to screening and randomization. This study includes a 4 -week screening period, a 28-week treatment period, and a 4 -week follow -up period (Figure 1)."
36,page_36,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 37The total duration o f study participation for each participant will be approximately 36 weeks. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive either daprodusta t or matching placebo tablets. Participants will not be provided with the results of the irHemoCue Hgb assessment during their participation in the study . Daprodustat and placebo doses for participants will be t itrated based upon HemoCue Hgb. Dose modifications for these participants will follow a protocol -specified dose adjustment algor ithm to achieve and maintain Hgb within the target range of 11.0 to 12.0 g/dL, inclusive. Dose changes will be made program matically in a blinded fashion by the IRT s ystem in order to ensure that investigators and participants stay blinded to the study treatment and the dose adjustments. A rescue algorithm is provided to minimize participants having an inadequ ate response to the treatment for their anemia for an extended period of time and to enable rescue therap y to be provided to the participants based on local clinical practice. (Section 7.7.2 ) Figure 1 Study Schematic 5.2. Number of Participants Approximately 1200 participants with anemia associated with CKD who are not on dialy siswill be screened to achieve approximately 600 randomized and to target approximately 540 evaluable participants for an estimated total of 270 evaluable participants with a 1:1 randomization perstudy treatment group. 5.3. Participant and Study Completion A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the stud y including theFollow -up visit, which takes place 4 weeks after the end of study treatment. The end of the stud y is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study or the last scheduled procedure shown in Table 1of Schedule of Activities (SoA) ."
37,page_37,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 385.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This study has a 28 -week Treatment Period ending with a 4 -week evaluation period from Week 24 to Week 28.At the Day 1 visit the subjects will be randomized to the daprodustator placebo arm by the IRT s ystem and the study treatment will be administered in a blinded manner. From Day 1 to Week 24 participant study treatment dosage will be adjus ted, per the dosing algorithm (S ection 7.2),in a bli nded fashion, by the IRT s ystem.. A placebo control will enable assessment of the magnitude of the daprodustat response and comparisons for safety data. Additionally ,a placebo comparator allows for an assessment of the extent to which any improvement i n symptoms and HRQoL observed inthedaprodustat treatment group is due to the drug ’seffect. The risk of drop -outs due to lack of treatment effect is estimated to alsobe low in this patient population since, p rior clinical studies have indicated that no n-dialysis, CKD patients can maintain , or even increase, their current level of Hgb value without requiring frequent interventional therap y with rhEPOs or IV iron for anemia [Skali ,2013] . Participants eligible for t his study will be naïve to rhEPO therapies and have limited I V iron exposure at the time of screening and randomization, but may be receiving oral iron which will be allowed to continue during the course of the stud y. Participants may start treatment or change their dose of iron (oral ,or IV if intolerable to oral) to maintain their iron levels during the study . Participants who experience worsening of their anemia during the stud y ma y receive rescue therap y based upon the protocol defined rescue algorithm. Therefore, the use of a placebo arm in this study does not represent the absence of an y treatment for anemia, but rather placebo in addition to appropriate standard of care. 5.5. Dose Justification Daprodustat starting doses were selected to enable the majori ty of study participants to reach the target Hgb concentration after approximately one red blood cell (RBC) lifespan of treatment (almost 3 months, pharmacod ynamic steady -state), without the need for any individual dose adjustments. However, due to the be tween -participant variability in Hgb response to a given dose of daprodustat and the relatively narrow Hgb target range, individual dose adjustments of daprodustat are still expected during the first few months of treatment. The daprodustat starting doses and dose steps (including the highest dose level, 16 mg) were based on dose exposure -response longitudinal modeling of Hgb data collected across the Phase 2 program. In this study , the starting dose of daprodustat will be 2 or4mgbased on baseline Hemo cue Hgb , or a matching placebo dose, for all participants . The starting dose is estimated to increase steady -state Hgb on average by approximately 1g/dL. This starting dose is consistent with the dosing algorithm being evaluated in the Phase 3 study [Glaxo SmithKline Document Number 2015N230102_03 ]for non -dialy sis dependent participants who are not currentl y receiving rhEPO therap y."

Blinding This will be a double -blind study .The participant , investigator ,site staff, and GSK study team are all blind edto the assigned study treatment. The IRTwill be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. The investigator may unblind a participant’s study treatment assignment in case of an emergency or in the event of a serious medical conditio n when knowledge of the stud y treatment assignment is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the participant. In case of lack of efficacy , a participant should receive rescue therapy as per protocol Section 7.7.2 , but the study treatment assignment should notbe unblinded except in case of an emergency or serious medical condition as previously described .GSK must be notified before the blind is broken ,unless identification of the study treatment is required for a medical emergency in which the knowledge of the specific blinded stud y treatment will affect the immediate management of the participant’s condition. I n this case, GSK must be notified within 24 hours after the blind is broken. The investigator should not reveal the participant’s unblinded treatment assignment to GSK, unless that information is important for the safety of partici pants currentl y in the study . The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the so urce documentation and eCRF. A participant may continue in the study if their treatment assignment blind is broken by the investigator .However the study treatment will be discontinued and the participant will be followed until the end of study on standard of care. GSK’s Global Clinical Safet y and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff may unblind the treatment assignment for any participant w ith an SAE. If the SAE requires that an expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the report, identify ing the participant’s treatment assignment, may be sent to investigators in accordance with local regulations and/or GSK policy . 7.4.1. Additional Considerations to Maintain the Blind This study is double -blinded, such that the sponsor, investi gator and participant will all be blinded to the study treatment assignment. Participants will not be provided with the"
45,page_45,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 46results of the HemoCue Hgb assessment during their pariticipation in the study . Subjects should be provided with the understanding to al so not obtain Hgb information from local labs prior to study visits. Additionally , Investigators, site staff and participants will also be blinded to some of the central laboratory results during the study . 7.5. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountability No preparation of stud y treatment is required.  The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study treatment received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study treatment. Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study treatment and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study treatment. All study treatments must be stored in a secure, environmentall y controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labelled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff.  The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study treatment accountability , reconciliation, and record maintenance (i .e., receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records).  Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study treatment are provided in the Study Reference Manual. Under normal conditions of handling and administration, study treatment is not expected to pose significant safet y risks to site staff . A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)/equivalent document describing occupational hazards and recommended handling precau tions either will be provided to the investigator, where this is required by local laws, or is available upon request from GSK. 7.6. Treatment Compliance Given participants self -administer study treatment(s) at home, compliance with blinded study treatment willbe assessed through query ing the participant during the site visits and documented in the source documents and eCRF. A record of the number of bottles of study treatment and the number of tablets from each bottle dispensed to and taken b y each participan tmust be maintained and reconciled with study treatment and compliance records. Treatment start and stop dates, including dates for treatment delays and/or treatmentinteruptions will also be recorded in the eCRF. 7.6.1. Study Treatment Extended Interruption Sites should contact GSK if a subject will beaway temporaril y from the research site for >5 weeks during their participation in the study , in order to discuss options for continuing randomized treatment and completing stud y visits. Every effort must be made to continue randomized treatment; however if a subject will be off the stud y treatment, sites should"
46,page_46,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 47consult with GSK in order to determine if the subjects should be withdrawn from treatment and brought in for a treatment discontinuation visit. 7.7. Standard of Care During the study (from screening), investigators are expected to monitor the participant’s overall clinical status to ensure standards of care are met to enable consistency of practice with Kidney Disease I mproving Global Outcomes [KDIGO,2012 ]guidelines or local equivalent (e.g, phosphate and albumin). For this study , specific iron management criteria and a dose adjustment algorithm for randomized treatment will apply . These were developed to reflect global cli nical practice. 7.7.1. Iron Management Criteria Investigators should make every effort to maintain participants’ serum TSAT ≥15% and ferritin ≥ 50 ng/mL from randomization (Day 1) to end of study . The investigator will follow the iron management criteria from randomization (Day 1) through end of study for all participants receiving study treatment. Iron therap y will be ad ministered, starting with oral iron, if ferritin is <50 ng/mL and/or TSAT is <15%, to reestablish participant ’sscreening (Week -4) iron parameters . Participants that are on oral iron at randomization may change their dose of oral iron in order to maintain their TSAT and ferritin levels as stated above. IV iron can be administered to participants who are intolerant to oral iron , otherwise IViron should only be administered to participants being evaluated for rescue criteria (Section 7.7.2 ), please see the SRM for additional IV Iron administration requirements .Iron parameters will be assessed at scheduled study visits outlined in the SoA. Iron therapy may be discontinued once screening ferritin and TSAT levels a re reached Only results for ferritin and TSAT measured by Q2 (central lab) should be used to inform if iron therap y is required. 7.7.2. Rescue Criteria A rescue algorithm is provided to minimize participants having an inadequate response to the treatment for thei r anemia for an extended period of time and to enable consistency in the application of rescue therap y across the stud y. Details are provided in Table 7. This rescue algorithm does not apply to participants with lowHgb as a result of an acute or subacute event with an identifiable cause (e.g., GI bleed, blood loss due to surgery or vascular access). In these cases, treatment should be directed to the specific cause and randomized treatment will be continued at the current dose (unless Hgb is ≥13 g/dL which requires a dose hold)."

If HemoCue Hgb value continues to meet the evaluation criteria for rescue, then Proceed to Step 2. If participant has TSAT ≥15% and Ferritin ≥ 50ng/mL, proceed to step 2. Step 2: Rescue Randomized treatment should be permanently discontinued (but participant should remain in study to moni tor Hgb) and the participant should be rescued according to local clinical practice : If HemoCue Hgb remains <8 .5g/dL despite I nitial Intervention (Step 1) based on the average of two HemoCue Hgb values 2 Rescue can be considered IV iron, rhEPO s and/or Tra nsfusions. 1. Symptoms should be related to anemia of CKD. Further information regarding collecting this data will be stated in the SRM. 2. Repeat HemoCue Hgb at the same study visit to confirm Hgb (using the same sample); take average of 2 values. The study site will supply any rescue medication that will be obtained locally . Although the use of rescue medications is allowable, if the participant meets rescue criteria, the use of rescue medications should be delay ed, if possible, for at least 4 weeks follow ing the initial administration of study treatment at randomization. The date of rescue medication administration as well as the name and dosage regimen of the rescue medication must be recorded in the eCRF 7.8. Concomitant Therapy Any medication or vaccine (in cluding over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at the time of enrollment or receives during the stud y must be recorded along with:"

The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are an y questions regarding concomita nt or prior therapy . 7.8.1. Permitted Medications and Non -Drug Therapies Unless specified as a prohibited medication in Section 7.8.2 , all concomitant medications should be considered permitted provided they are not c ontraindicated for the individual subject concerned. Co-administration of daprodustat with moderate CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., clopidogrel, teriflunomide, deferasirox) should be performed with caution. If one of these medications is started, stopped or the dose is changed, Hgb should subsequently be monitored at each visit for the following 12 weeks. 7.8.2. Prohibited Medications and Non -Drug Therapies Use of an y of the following prescription drugs from screening (Week -4) until 7 day s after the last dose of rando mized treatment is prohibited and will constitute a protocol violation. Strong inhibitors of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) Strong inducers of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin/rifampicin) Ferric Citrate Except for randomized treatment administered for this study , no ot her investigational agents or devices are permitted from study entry through completion of the study ."
49,page_49,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 507.9. Treatment after the End of the Study Participants will not receive an y additional treatment from GSK after completion of the study . The investigator is re sponsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to post-study care of the participant’s medical condition. 8. DISCONTINUA TION CRIT ERIA 8.1. Discontinuation of Study Treatment Every effort should be made to keep participants in the study including those wh o permanentl y stop randomized treatment. A participant may permanently discontinue randomized treatment at any time at his/her own request, or at the discretion of the investigator for safet y, or compliance reasons. However, treatment should not be discont inued due to an inadequate hemoglobin response to the study treatment, by the investigator, since in such instances the study treatment dosing algorithm ( Table 6) or the rescue criteria (Section 7.7.2 ) should be followed. A participant must permanently discontinue study treatment for the following reasons , and should continue attending study visits as outlined in the S oAfor participants that discontinued study treatment (Section 12.2 Appendix 2): Participant receives a kidney transplant Participant initiates dialysis Participant meets the criteria to receive rescue therap y (Section 7.7.2 ). Participant becomes pregnant or intends to become pregnant during the study . Liver chemistry abnormalities exceed the threshold criteria (Section 8.1.1 ). Diagnosis of cancer (new or recurrent), with the exception of localized squamous cell or basal cell carcinoma of the skin. Need for more than 14 day s of prohibited medication (Section 7.8.2 ). ADPKD participants only: foll owing further imaging , condition of the cy stic disease in the kidney (s) has worsened more than expected given the clinical scenario and no other cause for the kidney function decline and/or cy st enlargement can be identified (Section 9.5.4 ). In all cases, the reason for study treatment discontinuation and the date of the last dose will be recorded in the participant ’s eCRF . 8.1.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria Liver chemistry stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been d esigned to assure participant safety and evaluate liver event etiology . Discontinuation of study treatment for abnormal liver tests is required when : Aparticipant meets one of the conditions outlined in the algorithm"

Withdrawal f rom the Study Specific wording is included in the informed consent form which permits participants to discontinue study treatment and study procedures, but states an expectation that follow up information will alway s be required. Participants will agree to this at the time of consenting. Withdrawal of consent from the study is expected to be a rare occurrence. If a participant expresses a wish to withdraw consent from the study , the investigator will review the following contact options with the participan t. In-clinic and phone visits Follow -up via medical records review and/or other treating ph ysician Follow -up via family member or other third part y contact If all of these options are refused, then no further study visits or study -related telephone contact s will be conducted and the participant will be considered to have withdrawn consent. The principal investigator will be required to document that all alternative options have been reviewed with the participant ."
52,page_52,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 53For these participants ,information regardin g vital status will continue to be collected from available sources including those in the public domain based on accepted local laws and regulations. Where permitted, a third part y may be used to obtain information. In rare cases ifa participant has been discontinued from the study without discussing all possible alternatives for follow -upthe investigator may contact the participa ntsto discuss all of the alternative methods of follow -up described above. Participant smay withdraw from the study at an y time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at an y time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance or administrative reasons. If the participant withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the sponsor may retain and continue to use an y data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. If a participant withdraws from the study , he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the site study record s. Refer to the SoA (Section 2)for data to be collected at the time of stud y treatment discontinuation and follow -up and for an y further evaluations that need to be completed . 8.3. Lost to Follow Up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedl y fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted b y the study site. The follo wing actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a required stud y visit: Investigators should make every effort to contact participants who are deemed lost to follow -up and who have not withdrawn consent to follow -up contact . The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study . Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or desig nee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, telephone calls , medical records review, third -part follow -upand/ora certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These co ntact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record. 9. STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA (Section 2). Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed with the exception of immediate safet y concerns."
53,page_53,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 54Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or discontinue study treatment. Adher ence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA (Section 2), is essential and required for study conduct. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that pote ntial participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (e .g., blood count) and obtained before signing of ICF may be utilized for screening or baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol -specified criteria and was performed within the time frame d efined in the SoA (Section 2). The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of the study , including an y extra assessments that may be required, wil l be approximately 150 mL. This amount does not take into account the blood that can be collected at unscheduled visits. Repeat or unscheduled samples may be taken for safet y reasons or for tec hnical issues with the samples. This section lists the procedures and parameters of each plan ned study assessment. Post randomization visits should be referenced back to the Randomization visit (Day 1). The allowable visit window is ±1 week. However, during the stud y, to ensure continuity of randomized treatment, study visits must be no more than 5 weeks apart. In exceptional circumstances, minor changes to visit structure may be permitted after consultation with the Medical Monitor. Supplementary study conduct information is provided in the SRM. The SRM provides administrative and detailed technic al information that does not impact participant safety . 9.1. Screening and Critical Baseline A ssessments Before an y stud y-specific procedure is performed, valid informed consent must be obtained at screening. Demograph y and medical history (including cardiovas cular medical history /risk factors) will be assessed at screening (Week -4). A stable, HemoCue Hgb from 8.5to 10.0 g/dL at Day 1 (randomization visit) . oIf the initial HemoCue Hg assessment i s from 10.1 –10.3g/dL or from 8.2 to 8.4 g/dL , a repeat assess ment should be conducted. The two Hemocue Hgb should be averaged and the average Hemocue Hgb value should be from 8.5 –10.0 g/dL."
54,page_54,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 55oIf the average Hgb is also from 10.1 to 10.3 or from 8.2 to 8.4 g/dL then another HemoCue Hgb assessment can be performed us ing a new blood sample on the Day 1 visit date. oTwo values from one blood sample can be entered into the I RT s ystem however onl y the first value or the average value will be used for randomization and dose modification algorithm. . Full details of screenin g (Week -4) and Day 1 assessments are provided in the Schedule of Activities . 9.2. Efficacy Assessments Planned time points for all Hgb efficacy assessments are listed in the Schedule of Activities (Section 2). GSK will supply a point -of-care Hgb anal yzer (i.e. HemoCue) to each site for rapid measurement of Hgb. Blood samples for measurement of Hgb via HemoCue and also by the central laboratory will be c ollected as specified in the Schedule of Activities . All HemoCue Hgb assessments after Day 1 visit to study completion should be conducted at the end of the study visit, prior to study medication or rescue medication adminis tration. oAll efforts should be made to conduct the Hemocue Hgb measurements in a separate area away from the participants. 9.3. Adverse Events The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Section 12.3 (Appendix 3). The investigator and an y designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for following up AE sthat are serious, considered related to the study treatment or the stud y, or that caused the participant to discontinue the study treatment (see Section 8). 9.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting A E and SA E Information All SAEs will be c ollected from the start of treatment until the follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2). However, an y SAEs assessed as related to stud y participation (e.g., study treatment, protocol -mandated procedures, invasive tests, or change in existing therap y) or related to a GSK product will be recorded from the time a subject consents to participate in the study ."
55,page_55,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 56All AE swill be collected from the start of stud y treatment until the follow -up visit at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2). Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent will be recorded on the Medical History /Current Medical Conditions section of the eCRF not the AE section. All SAE swill be recorded and reported to GSK or designee immediatel y and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Section 12.4 (Appendix 3). The investigator will submit an y updated SAE data to GSK within 24 hours of it being available. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if th e investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify GSK . The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 12.4 (Appendix 3). 9.3.2. Method of Detecting A Es and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE sand/or SAE s. Open -ended and non -leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. 9.3.3. Follow -up of A Es and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs and non-serious AEs of special interest (as defined in Section 9.3.6 ), will be followed until the event is resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 8.3). Further information on follow -up procedure s is given in Section 12.4 (Appendix 4). 9.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to GSK of an SAE related to placebo or daprodust at is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safety of a study treatment under clinical investigation are met. GSK has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authorit y and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a study treatment under clinical investigation. GSK will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority , Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/In dependent Ethics Committees (IEC), and investigators."
56,page_56,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 57Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and GSK policy and forwarded to investigators as necess ary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific safet y information (e.g., summary or listing of SAE) from GSK will review and then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure [IB GlaxoSmithKline Documen t number RM2008/00267/07 ]and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 9.3.5. Events Referred to the Clinical Events Committee (CEC) Investigators should refer any event suspected to be one ofthe events below to the CEC for adjudication , See CEC Site Manual for full scope of reporting requirements : All-cause mortalit y (CV and non -CV mortality ) Non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) Non-fatal stroke Hospitalization for HF Thromboembolic events (vascular access thr ombosis, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) Events referred to the CEC will be subjected to blinded adjudication using pre -specified diagnostic criteria. When the investigator -reported event and the CEC assessment by the committee differ, the commit tee’s decision will be considered final. The detailed descriptions of the endpoint definitions used for adjudication are contained within the CEC Charter (available on request). Source documentation required to support the adjudication of the events is de scribed in the CEC site manual . 9.3.6. Other Cardiovascular (CV) Events GSK has identified other CV events of interest for all clinical studies. I nvestigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the eCRF for the following CV AEs and SAEs or an y event that may potentially be one of the categories listed: Arrh ythmias Pulmonary hypertension (also an AE of special interest see Section 9.3.7 for further details). Valvulopathy Revascularization"
57,page_57,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 58For any cardiovascular events detailed in Section 9.3.5 and S ection 9.3.6 and all deaths, whether or not they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Deat h sections of the CRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardiovascular death. The CV eCRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the CRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. 9.3.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest The investigator or site staff will be r esponsible for detecting, documenting and reporting any events that may represent the AEs of special interest listed below (using preferred terms): Death, MI, stroke, heart failure, thromboembolic events , thrombosis of vascular access Thrombosis and/or tis sue ischemia secondary to excessive ery thropoiesis Worsening of h ypertension Cardiomy opath y Pulmonary artery hypertension (see also Section 9.3.2 ) Cancer -related mortality ortumor progression and recurrence Esophageal and gastric erosions Proliferative retinopathy , macular edema, choroidal neovascularization Exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis The Death CRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. The results of an y investigation regarding adverse events of special interest should be recorded in the relevant sections of the participant ’s eCRF. 9.3.8. Possible Suicidal ity Related A dverse Events If during the stud y there is an occurrence of an AE or SAE which in the investigator’s opinion, is possibly related to suicidality , the Possible Suicidality Related Adverse Events (PSRAE) eCRF form should be completed (in additio n to the AE or SAE pages, as appropriate). This event may include, but is not limited to, one that involves suicidal ideation, a preparatory act toward imminent suicidal behavior, a suicide attempt, or a completed suicide. The investigator will exercise hi s or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an event is possibly related to suicidality ."
58,page_58,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 599.3.9. Pregnancy Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of study treatment and until seven day s after the last d ose. If a pregnancy is reported, the investigator should inform Sponsor within 2 weeks of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Section 12.5 (Appendix 5) . Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e .g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy ) are considered SAE s. 9.4. Treatment of Overdose There is no specific antidote for overdose with daprodustat. The expected manifestations of daprodustat overdosage include signs and s ymptoms associated with an excessive and/or rapid increase in Hgb concentration. Daprodustat is highly protein bound; thus, clearance of daprodustat by hemodial ysis (HD) or peritoneal dial ysis (PD) is very low and these are not effective methods to enhance the elimination of daprodustat. Daprodustat metabolites are, in part, cleared via hemodialy sis. In the event of a suspected overdose, it is recommended that the appropriate supportive clinical c are be instituted, as dictated b y the participant ’s clinical status. Additionally , participants should be monitored closely for CV events, increased heart rate and hematologic abnormalities. 9.5. Safet y Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA (Section 2). 9.5.1. Height and Weight Height and weight will be measured as specified in the SoA (Section 2). Weight should be measured with the participant wearing indoor day time clothing with no shoes. 9.5.2. Blood Pressure and Heart Rate Measurement of s ystolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and heart rate (HR) will be taken at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2) One measurement each of SBP, DBP and HR will be taken except at Day 1 and Week 28 (or Early Treatment Discontinuation visit) when SBP, DBP and HR will be measured in triplicate. For measurements taken in triplicat e, the readings can be averaged and the averaged value would be included in the eCRF. Measurements will be taken with participants in a seated position after at least a 5-minute rest period, and will be before collection of blood samples for laboratory testing, where applicable."
59,page_59,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 60For subjects transitioning to dialy sis, SBP, DBP and HR will be measured pre and post -dialy sis, whenever possible (e.g., in -center HD). Otherwise these assessments will be done between dial ysis sessions. 9.5.3. Electrocardiograms ECG meas urements will be taken at the time points specified in the SoA (Section 2). Full 12-lead ECGs will be recorded with the participant in a supine position. HR, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT (uncorrected) inter val will be measured. QTcB will be calculated (machine -read or manually ). When an ECG is performed, two additional ECGs are required if the initial ECG indicates prolonged QTc (see Section 6.2) using the automat ed or manually calculated QTcB value. The average QTcB value of all three ECGs will be used to determine eligibility (see Section 6.2). Additional details are provided in the SRM. ECG data will be read locally by aphysician with experience in reading and interpreting ECGs. The over -read of the ECG will be required to confirm eligibility . Additional details are provided in the SRM . All ECGs will be performed before measurement of SBP, DBP and HR and collection of blood samples for laboratory testing . For subjects transitioning to dialy sis, ECGs will be performed before measurement of SBP, DBP, HR and before collection of blood samples for laboratory testing, where applicable (e.g., would not apply if ECG is perf ormed post -HD). 9.5.4. Ultrasound An ultrasound of the kidney s and adrenal glands will be performed prior to randomization. I t is understood that the adrenal glands will not alway s be able to be visualized. Non -visualization of the adrenals is not a reason to exc lude a participant from randomization. Further details are provided in the SRM. A documented ultrasound of the kidney s within the 6 months prior to screening may be used to assess entry criteria (see Section 6.2), provided the size and cy st category has been reported. If a more sensitive imaging study (e.g., MRI, CT) has been performed within this timeframe and a report is available, this may be used in place of the ultrasound. For randomized participants with A DPKD : An ultrasound of the kidney s will be performed when participants permanently discontinue study treatment , preferabl y within one month of discontinuation of study treatment as soon as clinically feasible. This may occur during the study OR at the endof study . See Table 1and Table 3for details. As clinically feasible, an ultrasound should be performed PRI OR to the following: oTransition to dialy sis oBilateral nephrectomy"
60,page_60,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 61oKidney transplant . An addi tional ultrasound may be performed at any time during the study based on investigator’s clinical judgment (e.g., deterioration of kidney function as measured b y eGFR in the absence of other identifiable causes). Other imaging techniques (e.g., MRI ) can be performed at the investigator’s discretion . If an additional imaging study is performed, and the condition of the cy stic disease in the kidney (s)has worsened more than expected given the clinical scenario, then study treatment should be temporarily stop ped. Subsequently , if no other cause for the kidney function decline and/or cy st enlargement can be identified, study treatment should be permanently discontinued after consultation with the Medical Monitor. 9.5.5. Clinical Laboratory Assessments Refer to Table 8for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the SoA (Section 2)for the timing and frequency . The investigator must review the laboratory repor t, document this review, and record an y clinicall y relevant changes occurring during the stud y in the AE section of the CRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. All laboratory tests with values that are considered clinically significantl y abnormal during participation in the study or within seven day s after the last dose of randomized treatment should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline. If such values do not return to normal within a period judged reasonable b y the investigator the sponsor should be notified. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable b y the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified. All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Table 8, must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA (Section 2).Laboratory assessments will be performed b y a central laboratory with the exception of HemoCue Hgb and urine pregnancy tests which will be performed at the clinical site. The results of each HemoCue Hgb must be entered into the participant ’s eCRF. Local laboratory results are only required in the event that the central laboratory results are not available in time for either study treatment administration and/or response evaluation. If a local sample is required, it is important that the sample for central anal ysis is obtained at the same time."

Patient Reported Outcomes The patient -reporte d effect of daprodustat and placebo on s ymptoms, health related quality of life (HR -QoL), health status (e.g., utility) and work productivity and activity impairment will be assessed. Sy mptoms will be assessed using a s ymptoms questionnaire which is specif ic to anemia of Chronic Kidney Disease -Anemia Questionnaire (CKD - AQ). Overall s ymptom severit y will be assessed using the patient global impression of severit y (PGI -S), and overall sy mptom change using the patient global impression of change (PGI -C). Qua lity of life will be measured via SF -36 and health status via the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level Health Utility Index (EQ -5D-5L) and the EuroQol Visual"
62,page_62,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 63Analogue Scale (EQ -VAS). Work productivity and regular daily activity impairment will be measured via the W ork Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire for the specific health problem of anemia, Clinical Practice Version 2.0 (WPAI -ANS -CPV; V2.0). All questionnaires used in this study have been translated and culturall y adapted for use in local count ry languages and will be administered electronically only.Specific instructions on how the participant is to complete these questionnaires will be provided in the SRM. Patient reported outcomes questionnaires are to be administered at the beginning of th e visits andthe subjects should not be told the results of any diagnostic tests prior to completing the questionnaires. Adequate time must be allowed to complete all items on questionnaires, and if necessary , the subject must be encouraged to complete any missing items . So as to minimize the amount of missing data, t he questionnaires should be completed b y participants at a clinic visit, in the order specified: PGI -S, PGI -C, CKD - AQ, SF -36, EQ -5D-5L and EQ -VAS, then the WPAI -ANS -CPV. Additional instruction s on how investigators and site staff will be trained to provide participants with instructions will be provided in the SRM. 9.6.1. Chronic Kidney Disease -Anemia Questionnaire (CKD -AQ) A novel sy mptom questionnaire –CKD -AQ has been developed to collect concep ts of interest for the anemia of CKD population. Unlike the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therap y –Anemia (FACT -AN) and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therap y – Fatigue (FACIT -Fatigue) which have not demonstrated content validity specific for t he anemia of CKD population, the novel CKD -AQ instrument was developed to verify and ensure that concepts specific for anemia of CKD were captured and measured. It will measure both the frequency and/or severity in anemia of CKD concepts such as Weakness, Energy , Tiredness, Shortness of Breath, Exertion, Chest Pain, Memory , Concentration, Standing, Sleep and Distress over the past 7 day s. 9.6.2. Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI -S) and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI -C) The PGI -S is a 1 -item ques tionnaire designed to assess participant ’s impression of disease severity of their anemia of CKD. It is measured on a 5 -point disease severit y scale (absent, mild, moderate, severe, or very severe) during the past 24 hours. The PGI -C is a 1 -item questionna ire designed to assess a participant ’s impression of symptoms change of their anemia of CKD. It is measured on a 7 -point Likert -type response scale (very much improved, moderatel y improved, minimally improved, no change, minimally worse, moderatel y worse, or very much worse) since they first started the study . 9.6.3. Health Related Quality of Life (SF -36) The SF -36 acute version is a general health status questionnaire designed to elucidate the participant ’s self-perception of their health on several domains, incl uding phy sical"
63,page_63,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 64functioning, role ph ysical, bodily pain, vitality , social functioning, role emotional, mental health, and general health. The questionnaire contains 36 questions within these domains that ask the participant to recall how they felt during th e past seven day s. 9.6.4. Health Status (EQ -5D-5L & EQ -VAS) EQ-5D-5L consists of 2 concepts –the EQ -5D-5L descriptive s ystem and the EQ -VAS. The EQ -5D-5L is a self -reported descriptive s ystem of health -related quality of life states consisting of five dimensions (mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety /depression) each of which can take one of five responses. The responses record five levels of severit y (no problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme problems) within a particular EQ -5D dimension. Self -reported health status captured b y EQ -5D-5L relates to the participant ’s situation at the time of completion. The EQ VAS records the respondent’s self -rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale where the endpoint s are labeled ‘ the best health y ou can imagine’ and ‘ the worst health y ou can imagine’ at the time of completion . This information is used as a quantitative measure of health outcome as judged by individual participants . 9.6.5. Work Productivity and A ctivity Impa irment (WPA I-ANS-CPV) The WPAI -ANS -CPV is an anemia specific questionnaire designed as a self -reported quantitative assessment of social functioning related to work and regular daily activities. It contains two main concepts -work productivity impairment m easured via absenteeism (time missed from work), presenteeism (impairment at work) and regular daily activity impairment. The questionnaire contains 6 questions and asks the patient to recall work and activity impairment over the past 7 day s. 9.7. Actigraphy Patients with anemia in CKD can experience decreased ph ysical functioning and sleep disturbances [ KDIGO ,2012]. Therefore, actigraphy assessment in this study will be conducted as a means to measure changes in the phy sical activity and sleep from a baseline measurement taken prior to Randomization (Day 1) to the end of study . The data collected may be used to conduct exploratory analy ses of phy sical activity and sleep. ActiGraph GT9X Link is being piloted in this study to capture and record high resolution human activity information by using a validated solid state 3 -axis MEMS accelerometer and proprietary filtering algorithm to report daily movement associated with physical activity and sleep .This device will capture pa tterns of activity throughout the day and night . Physical activity will be measure d by subject activity metrics such as steps taken, physical activity intensity , and activity /sedentary bouts . Sleep activity will bemeasure d by subject sleep period metric s such as total sleep time, sleep latency and sleep efficiency ."
64,page_64,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 65Prior to the participant leaving the stud y site at the screening visit, the participant must have been trained on how to position the device to their arm, how to charge the battery and check the battery status. These topics are all covered in the Participant Information Leaflet and further instructions regarding distribution, operation, retrieval of ActiGraph GT9X L ink devices will be provided in the SRM. All efforts should be made to encourag e participation in this activity monitoring assessment. If a participant is unable to take part, the reason should be documented, and they may continue in the study . The technical performance of the Actigraph device will also be closel y monitored and assessed during the stud y and the Sponsor may elect to discontinue this assessment if device related difficulties are encountered. 9.8. Pharmaco kinetics Pharmaco kinetic parameters are not evaluated in this study . 9.9. Genetics A 6mL blood sample for DNA isolation will be collected from participants who have consented to participate in the genetics analy sis component of the study . Participation is optional. Participants who do not wish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in the stud y. In the eve nt of DNA extraction failure, a replacement genetic blood sample may be requested from the participant. Signed informed consent will be required to obtain a replacement sample unless it was included in the original consent. See Section 12.5 (Appendix 5) for Information regarding genetic research. Details on processes for collection and shipment and destruction of these samples can be found in Q2Solutions I nvestigator Manual 9.10. Storage Biomarkers Blood samples will not be stored for biomarker analy sis in this study 9.11. Healthcare Resource Utilization and Economics Healthcare resource utilization and health economic data, associated with medical encounters, will be collected in the CRF by the investigator and study -site personnel for all participants throughout the study . Protocol -mandated procedures, tests, and encounters are excluded. The data collected may be used to conduct exploratory economic analy ses and will include: Number and duration of medical care encounters, including surgeries, and other selected procedures (inpatient and outpatient)"
65,page_65,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 66Duration of hospitalization (total day s or length of stay , including duration by wards [ eg,intensive care unit]) Number and t ype of diag nostic and therapeutic tests and procedures Outpatient medical encounters and treatments (including ph ysician or emergency room visits, tests and procedures, and medications). Pharmacy utilization focused on a nemia associated with CKD only , including rhEPO rescue, IV iron (use or rescue), blood pressure medications, and cholesterol lowering agents 9.12. Patient Feedback Survey An optional smartphone App or website will be available during the study . Participants may be asked forfeedback on their experience duri ng the stud y, in the form of anony mized App or web based survey s. The purpose of this survey is for GSK to learn about participant experience in the study and possibly make future GSK trials more participant friendl y and better focused on participant’s nee ds. 10. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS AND DA TA ANALYSES 10.1. Primary Hypothesis The primary Hgb efficacy objective will assess the estimand defined as the comparative treatment effect in mean Hgb change betw een baseline and evaluation peorid (EP, i.e., week24 to week 28inclusive) in all randomized participants ; defined as those who remain in follow -upthroughout the period of stabilization and have at least one Hgb assessment during the EP regardless of adherence to study treatment. The analy sis will testwhether da produstat is superior to placebo according to the following statistical hypotheses: Null: The difference in mean change in Hgb between baseline and EP, between treatment arms (daprodustat -placebo), is less than or equal to 0 g/dL. Alternative: The differe nce in mean change in Hgb between baseline and EP between treatment arms (daprodustat -placebo), is greater than to 0 g/dL . Statistical significance will be assessed at the one-sided 2.5% level. An analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA) model including the randomization stratification factor ,baseline hemoglobin and treatment will be used to obtain a point estimate and the two-sided 95% CIfor the treatment difference (daprodustat -placebo) and generate the one-sided p-value for the superiority test. Superiority will be established if the one-sided p -value is less than 0.0 25."
66,page_66,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 6710.2. Sample Size Determination 10.2.1. Sample Size A ssumptions The sample size of this study has been primarily determined in order to achieve sufficient power for the principal secondary endpoint SF -36 vitality sub-score, since the anticipated effect size of this endpoint is less than that for the primary endpoint. Approximately 600 participants are planned to be randomized (300 per arm) to receive daprodustat or placebo, who will be treated to achieve and maintain Hgb between 11 and 12 g/dL. Under the assumption that up to 10% of participants will withdraw from the study before Week 24 (start of EP), 600 randomized participants will result in at least 540 evaluable participants. For the primary endpoi nt, the expected difference in mean Hgb change from baseline and the EP, between arms, is 1.0 g/dL and the anticipated between participant standard deviation (SD) is 1.5 g/dL, based on historical rhEPO trials and daprodustat clinical trial experience to da te. The planned study size provides more than 99% power for superiority . In addition, it is anticipated that the smallest difference in mean Hgb change between arms that would meet the statistical criterion for superiorit y would be 0.25 g/dL. For the fi rst principal secondary endpoint of % of participants having a Hgb increase of ≥1.0 g/dL from baseline to EP , 540 evaluable participants provides >90% power to detect a 20% difference between daprodustat and placebo, assuming 30% of placebo arm participants will have a Hgb increase of ≥1.0 g/dL. In that case the smallest difference between daprodustat and placebo that would meet the statistical criterion for superiorit y would be 8%. For the second principal secondary endpoint of mean change in SF -36 vitality sub-score between baseline and week 28, 540 evaluable participants provides for 79% power to detect a difference between arms under the assumption of a between treatment effect of 5 points in favor of daprodustat and a within -group standard deviation of 21 points. Prior research has determined that anemia is associated wi th a difference of 5.4 points from baseline for SF -36 vitality scores (Bjorner , 2007) . It is expected that the smallest difference between arms that would meet the statistical criterion for superiority in this principal seco ndary endpoint is 3.5 points. 10.2.2. Sample Size Sensitivity Since the sample size is primarily determined by the principal secondary endpoint SF -36 vitality sub-score, the following table illustrates the impact on power for that endpoint based on alternative a ssumptions for the between participant SD and the number of evaluable participants."

Sample Size Re -Estimation or A djustment The assumptions used to determine the planned sample size may be reassessed, if during the course of the study , information becomes available external to the trial that is informative wi th respect to clinically meaningful difference or variabilit y estimates for the QoL principal secondary endpoint. If considered appropriate the planned sample size may be re -calculated and implemented via a protocol amendment as necessary . It is anticipate d that the maximum sample size for the study will not exceed 800patients. 10.3. Data Analysis Considerations 10.3.1. Analysis Populations The primary population for Hgb efficacy anal yses will be the All Randomized Intent -to- Treat (ITT) Population. Participants will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they were randomized. For analy ses of qualit y of life endpoints, the All Randomized (I TT) Population will also be used. Participants will be anal yzed according to the treatment to which they were randomized . The primary population for safet y (Safet y Population) will consist of all randomized participants who receive at least one dose of randomized treatment. Participants will be analyzed according to the treatment received. Additional populations may be defi ned in the Reporting and Anal ysis Plan ( RAP ). 10.4. Key Elements of A nalysis Plan 10.4.1. Primary Analyses Mean change in Hg b between baseline and EP ( week24toweek 28inclusive ): The primary efficacy estimand is to compare the effect of treatment for the evaluation o f mean change from baseline in Hgb during the4 week EPin all ITT participants with at least one Hgb during the EP. The ITT anal ysis of this endpoint will include all on and off treatment Hgb values of the ITT population, including values taken after resc ue and IP discontinuation. The analysis will use an ANCOVA model. For each participant , the baseline Hgb will be the value obtained on Day 1, prior to taking randomized treatment, and Hgb during EP will be determined b y calculating the mean of all av ailab le Hgb values between week24 to week 28 inclusive regardless of the use of rescue medication"
68,page_68,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 69oradherence to randomized treatment. The ANCOVA model will include the randomization stratification factor , baseline Hgb and treatment. It will provide a point estimate and two-sided 95% CI for the treatment effect, together with the one-sided p- value. There will be no imputation for missing data. Sensitivity Analysis: A sensitivity anal ysis that considers an “on -drug” efficacy estimand will be conducted. In this anal ysis, only Hgb values measured while the participant was taking randomized study medication will be included. Missing Hgb values will be imputed based on the reasons of missing. Full details will be provided in the RAP. 10.4.2. Secondary Analyses 10.4.2.1. Princip al Secondary Efficacy Analyses Conditional on the primary endpoint achieving superiority at the one-sided 2.5% level, statistical testing will progress to the principal secondary endpoints which will evaluate superiority using a one-sided 2.5% significance level. For the first principal secondary endpoint of % of participants having a Hgb increase of ≥1.0 g/dL from baseline to EP ,aCochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) chi -squared test, adjusting for treatment , baseline Hgb, and the prognostic randomization stratification factor , will be used to make comparisons between the treatment groups. An “effectiveness” estimand will be used in the anal ysis to include all on and off treatment Hgb values of the ITT populations, including values taken after rescue and IP discontinuation. For the second principal secondary endpoint of mean change in SF -36 vitality sub-score between baseline and Week 28, an ANCOVA model will be used to compare the difference in this endpoint between arms, including factors for baseline score, treatment and the randomization stratification factor. An “efficacy ” estim and will be used in the analysis in which we include only on-treatment values and exclude measures taken after IP disc/rescue medication. For this endpoint, an alternative approach may be conducted that includes the development of a prior distribution for the effects of placebo based on external data to be combined with the data from this trial in a Bay esian framework in order to make inference on the effects of daprodustat. I f such an approach is undertaken it will be fully described in the RAP prior to the breaking of the stud y blind. In addition, descriptive statistics for each individual item within the SF -36 vitality sub- score will be generated. Of particular interest are the items assessing if patients have a lot of energy , feel tired, and feel worn out. These concepts have been found to be important and relevant concepts in this population [Martin , 2011] . Additional secondary /exploratory endpoints are listed in Section 4. 10.4.2.2. Safety Analyses Safety data, including all AEs (i.e., non -serious, serious and AEs of special interest), laboratory data, vital signs, concomitant medications and meeting protocol defined"
69,page_69,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 70stopping criteria (e.g., liver chemistry ) will be descripti vely summarized by treatment arm. Reasons for stopping randomized treatment and for earl y stud y withdrawal will also be summarized by treatment group and time to stopping treatment or study will be presented graphicall y and assessed. Full details of all safet y data reporting will be described in the RAP. 10.4.3. Multiplicity Strategy The primary endpoint will be tested first for superiority using a one-sided 2.5% significance level. Conditional on achieving statistical significance, the first principal secondar yendpoint will be tested for superiorit y using a one-sided 2.5% significance level. Finall y, conditional on achieving statistical significance of both the primary endpoint, and the first principal secondary endpoint, the second principal secondary endpoin t will be tested for superiorit y using a one-sided 2.5% significance level. This three -step hierarchical strategy will preserve the study -wise Ty pe I error rate at a one- sided 2.5% level. The additional secondary/exploratory endpoints as listed in Sectio n 4are of exploratory nature, andif tested, will not be adjusted for multiplicity . Summary statistics and nominal one-sided 2.5% significance levels will be used to describe the results of these treatment comparisons. 10.4.4. Covariate s and Subgroups of Interest The primary and principal secondary endpoint swill be evaluated for a set of pre - specified subgroups. Subgroup anal yses are aimed to assess for consistency with the overall result, and they may have low power if the subgroup is small. Statistical models ( ANCOVA or CMH chi -squared test) will be adjusted for the covariates used in the original anal ysis, subgroup, treatment and treatment by subgroup interaction . Point estimates and two-sided 95% CI s will be estimated (presented o n Forest Plots) and the subgroup b y treatment interaction p -value calculated. Subgroup anal yses will not be adjusted for multiplicity . Further subgroups/covariates may be defined in the RAP."

Interim A nalyses An interim anal ysis to assess futility may be performed if the rate of the enrolment is considerabl y slower than expected. This anal ysis will only consist of the principal secondary endpoint of QoL SF-36 vitality sub-score, due to its considerably larger sample -size requiremen t for a powered anal ysis compared to the primary endpoint. The primary endpoint of mean change in Hgb between baseline and EP, and the principal secondary endpoint of % of participant s having a Hgb increase of ≥1.0 g/dL from baseline at EP will not be included in this interim analy sis. The potential outcomes of this analysis include the continuation of the study with no change and the stopping of the enrolment. It is planned that the in terim anal ysis will only be performed once approximately 200 participants have completed 28 weeks of stud y in order to preserve power for the primary endpoint should the study be discontinued. If the observed difference for theQoL vitality endpoint betwee n daprodustat and placebo is less than 2 points at the time of the interim analysis, study enrolment will be stopped. This decision guideline was determined to have favorable operating characteristics, such as an unconditional power of <30%, and an accepta bly low probability of a false stop (<10%). Since the study will not be stopped for positive results, ty pe I error will not be inflated. Inference on the aforementioned Hgb parameters will still be made as per Section 10.4, even if the study is stopped for futility based on QoL S F-36 vitality sub- score. The interim anal ysis will be performed and the results reviewed b ya small team who are not involved in the conduct of this study . Access to the interim results willberestricted to this small team until the study has been completed and the database is finalized and unblinded. Details regarding the justification for the interim anal ysis, including the blinding plan and associated measures to protect the integri ty of the trial will be included in the RAP."

Appendix 3: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting Definition of A E AE Definition An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of a study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a study treatment. Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet yassessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinicall y significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (ie, not related to progression of underly ing dise ase). Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after stud y treatment administration even though it may have been prese nt before the start of the study . Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, sy mptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. The signs, s ymptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported as AE or SAE if they fulfill the definition of an AE or SAE. Also, ""lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action "" constitutes an AE or SAE."
83,page_83,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 84Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safet y assessments which are associated with the underl ying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or s ymptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant’s condition. Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endosco py, appendectom y): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. Reporting of SA E to GSK SAE Reporting to GSK via Electronic Data Collection Tool  The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to GSK will be the electronic data collection tool. If the electronic s ystem is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data collection tool (see next section ) in order to report the event within 24 hours. The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic sy stem as soon as it becomes available. The investigator or medically -qualified sub -investigator must show evidence within the eCRF (e.g., check review box, signature, etc.) of review and verification of the relationship of each SAE to I P/study participation (causalit y) within 72 hours of SAE entry into the eCRF. After the stud y is completed at a given site, the electronic data collection tool will be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data. If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has been taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see next section) or to the medical monitor/SAE coordinator by telephone. Contacts for SAE reporting can be found at the beginning of this protocol on the Medical Monitor Contact I nformation page."
84,page_84,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 8512.3.1. Definition of Serious A dverse Events If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious cond itions are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/sy mptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease, etc). Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: Results in death Is life -threaten ing NOTE: The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hy pothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out -patient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. Result s in disability/incapacity NOTE:The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in"

If fractionation is unavailable and ALT 3xUL N and total bilirubin 2xULN, then the event is still to be reported as an SAE. ** INR testing not required per protocol and the threshold value does not apply to participants receiving anticoagulants. If INR measurement is obtained, the value is to be recorded on the SAE form. 12.3.2. Recording of A Es and SA Es AEs and SAE Recording: When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (e.g., hospital progress notes, laboratory , and diagnostics reports) relative to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant info rmation regarding an AE/SAE in the eCRF It is notacceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant ’s medical records to GSK in lieu of completion of the AE/SAE eCRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certa in cases are requested b y GSK . In this instance, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be blinded on the copies of the medical records prior to submission to GSK . The investigator will attempt to establish a diagn osis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. I n such cases, the diagnosis will be documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms. Participant -completed Patient Reported Outcomes questionnaires and the coll ection of AE data are independent components of the study ."
86,page_86,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 8712.3.3. Evaluating AEs and SA Es Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and will assign it to one of the following cat egories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant , causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate: An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal every day activities Severe: An e vent that prevents normal every day activities. An AE that is assessed as severe will not be confused with an SAE. Severit y is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the pre -defined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE. Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between randomized treatment and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. A""reasonable possibility "" is meant to convey that there are facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underly ing diseases, concomitant therap y, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the or randomized treatment will be considered and investigated. The investigator will also consult the IB a nd/or Product I nformation, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK . However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event prior to the initial trans mission of the SAE data to GSK. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information, amending the SAE data collection tool accordingl y. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements."
87,page_87,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 88Follow -up of A Es and SA Es The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as may be indicated or as requested by GSK to elucidate as fully as possible the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE. The investigator is obligated to assist. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations or consultation with other health care professionals. New or updated information wi ll be recorded in the originally completed eCRF. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within the designated reporting time frames."

Appendix 5: Genetics USE/ANALYSIS OF DNA Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to therap y, susceptibility , severit y and progression of disease. Variable response to therap y ma y be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; mechanism of action of the drug; disease etiology ; and/or molecular subty pe of the disease being treated. Therefore, where local r egulations and I RB/IEC allow, a blood sample will be collected for DNA analy sis DNA s amples will be used for research related to daprodustat or anemia associated with CKD and related diseases. They may also be used to develop tests/assay s (including diagnostic tests) related to daprodustat (or study treatments of this drug class), and anem ia associated with CKD . Genetic research may consist of the analysis of one or more candidate genes or the analy sis of genetic markers throughout the genome. DNA samples will be analy zed if it is hy pothesized that this may help further understand the clini cal data. DNA samples will be analy zed initially using genome -wide genot yping and performing genome -wide and candidate gene analy sis of efficacy measures. Additional analy ses may be conducted if it is hy pothesized that this may help further understand the clinical data, such as investigating PK and /or safet y endpoints as well as sequencing of the DNA. The samples may be analy zed as part of a multi -study assessment of genetic factors involved in the response to daprodustat or study treatments of this class . The results of genetic anal yses may be reported in the clinical study report or in a separate study summary . GSK will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentialit y. The samples will be retained while r esearch on daprodustat (or stud y treatments of this class) or anemia associated with CKD continues but no longer than 15 years after the last subject last visit or other period as per local requirements. Study Population Any subject who is randomized in t he study can participate in genetic research. Any subject who has received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant must be excluded from the genetic research. Study Assessments and Procedures A key component of successful genetic research is the collection o f samples during clinical studies. Collection of samples, even when no a priori hypothesis has been identified, may enable future genetic anal yses to be conducted to help understand variability in disease and medicine response."

A blood sample is collected at the Baseline visit, after the subject has been randomized and provided informed consent for genetic research. Instructions for collection and shipping of the genetic sample are described in the laboratory manual. The DNA from the blood sample may undergo quality control analy ses to confirm the integrity of the sample. If there are concerns regarding the quality of the sample, then the sample may be destroy ed. The blood sample is taken on a single occasion unless a duplicate sample is required due to an inabilit y to utilize the original sample. The genetic sample is labelled (or “coded”) with the same stud y specific number used to label other samples and data in the study . This number can be traced or linked back to the subject by the investigator or site staff. Coded samples do not carry personal identifiers (such as name or social security number). Subject Withdrawal from Study If a subject who has consented to participat e in genetic research withdraws from the clinical study for any reason other than being lost to follow -up, the subject will be given a choice of one of the following options concerning the genetic sample, if already collected: Continue to participate in th e genetic research in which case the genetic DNA sample is retained Discontinue participation in the genetic research and destroy the genetic DNA sample If a subject withdraws consent for genetic research or requests sample destruction for an y reason, the investigator must complete the appropriate documentation to request sample destruction within the timeframe specified b y GSK and maintain the documentation in the site study records . Genoty pe data may be generated during the study or after completion of the study and may be anal yzed during the study or stored for future anal ysis. If a subject withdraws consent for genetic research and genot ype data has not been analyzed, it will not be analy zed or used for future research. Genetic data that has been anal yzed at the time of withdrawn consent will continue to be stored and used, as appropriate. Screen and Baseline Failures If a sample for genetic research has been collected and it is determined that the subject does not meet the entry criteria for particip ation in the study , then the investigator should instruct the subject that their genetic sample will be destroy ed. No forms are required to complete this process as it will be completed as part of the consent and sample reconciliation process. In this ins tance a sample destruction form will not be available to include in the site files. Provision of Study Results and Confidentiality of Subject’s Genetic Data"
93,page_93,"2016N298481_02 CONFIDENTIA L 205270 94GSK may summarize the genetic research results in the clinical study report, or separately and may publish the results in scientific journals. GSK may share genetic research data with other scientists to further scientific understanding in alignment with the informed consent. GSK does not inform the subject, family members, insurers, or employ ers of in dividual genot yping results that are not known to be relevant to the subject’s medical care at the time of the study , unless required b y law. This is due to the fact that the information generated from genetic studies is generally preliminary in nature, an d therefore the significance and scientific validity of the results are undetermined. Further, data generated in a research laboratory may not meet regulatory requirements for inclusion in clinical care."
