Treatment Arms and Duration: Study I1F-JE-RHCV consists of 3 periods: a screening period of up to 30 days, a 12 -week Induct ion Dosing Period, and an 8 -week Maintenance Dosing period. All eligible pat ients will be administered 160 mg ixekizumab as 2 SC injectio ns at Week 0 (baseline; Visit 2) fo llowed by 80 m g as 1 injecti on at Week 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. Patients who are inadequate responders ( Global Improvem ent Score [ GIS] ≥2 at Week 12 and based on the invest igators’ discretion) will be administered 80 mg as 1 inject ion at Week 12, 14, 16, and 18 or until they achieve a GIS score of1. Number of Patients: A total o f 12 pati ents will be enrolled so that at least 5 patients with EP and 5 patients with GPP who are inadequate responders (GIS ≥2 at Week 12 and based on the invest igators’ discretion) will cont inue to use ixekizumab beyo nd Week 12. Additional enrollment m ay occur and sample size m ay be increased , if no GPP or EP patients enter into Peri od 3 (Maintenance Dosing Period) of the study . Statistical Analysis: Primary analysis o f efficacy, health outcome and safet y measures will be conducted based on patients who continued ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W bey ond Week 12 by disease ty pe (ie, GPP and EP separately). Baseline is defined as the last available value before the first dose in Period 2; in most cases, it will be the value recorded at Week 0 (Visit 2). As thi s is a single arm s tudy with very small sample si ze, no statistical inference will be perform ed. Continuous data will be summarized in terms of the mean, standard deviat ion, minimum, maximum, median, and number of observat ions. Categorical data will be summarized as frequen cy counts."

Study Rationale Psori asis (Ps) is a commo n chronic skin disorder wit h an estimated prevalence of 1.0% in Japan (Tang et al .2014). The pathogenesis of psoriasis has undergone many paradigm shift s during the past 3 decades. Psoriasis is no longer considered fundamentally a skin disease, but rather a chronic inflammatory process resul ting fro m a dysfunct ional immune system (Kim and Krueger 2015). For patients with psoriasis, the protective elements of the skin (corneocy tes, keratinocy tes, chem okines, and immunocy tes, such as T cells and dendrit ic ant igen-present ing cells [DiMeglio et al. 2011; Bergboer et al. 2012]) beco me disrupted, result ing in dysfunct ional feedback loops and vicious cycles leading to development of life -long, thi ck, scaly, well - demarcated pl aques (Di Megli o et al . 2014). Psoriasis includes several phenoty pes often separated into the fo llowing classificat ions; plaque Ps, guttate Ps, pustular Ps, and ery throdermic Ps(EP). Psoriat ic arthritis (PsA) may coexist in up to 30% of patients with Ps. The most commo n type of psori asis is plaque Ps (psoriasis vulgaris), and clinical features include sharply demarcated, scaly ery thematous pl aques that are often associ ated wi th itching, pain, and cracking of the skin. These lesio ns most typically affect the elbows, knees, scalp, lumbar area, umbilical area, and gluteal cleft. Approximately 1/4 to 1/3 of plaque Ps pat ients have moderate -to-severe Ps, corres ponding to involvement of over 5% of their body surface area (BSA) (Dubin et al. 2003; Menter and Griffit hs 2007). Disease of this extent i s physically and/or soci ally debili tating to a degree comparable with other chronic medical conditions (Rapp et al. 1999). Generalized pustular Ps (GPP) and EPare relat ively rare but more severe variants of Ps. Generalized pustular Ps is characterized by mult iple sterile pustules all over the body and m ay be accompanied by systemic symptoms including fever, chills, severe itching, dehydrat ion, rapi d pulse rate, exhaust ion, anemia, weight loss, and muscle weakness. Erythrodermic Ps is a particular inflammatory type of Ps that can affect the whole body . The reddening and shedding of the skin are often accompanied by severe itching and pain, heart rate increase, fluid loss, and fluctuating body temperature. Both Ps subt ypes can so metimes be life-threatening wi thout adequate treatment. Patients with these severe subtypes are known to experience frequent relapses (Rosenbach et al. 2010), and require systemic treatment . Ho wever the treatment options are further limited and there are significant unmet needs for effect ive treatments for patients with GPP and EP. Study I1F-JE-RHCV (RHCV) i s a m ulticenter, open -label , post marketing clinical trialdesigned to assess the efficacy and safet y of ixekizumab through Week 20 when administered Q2W beyo nd Week 12 in pat ients with GPP and EP. This study is being conducted by Eli Lilly Japan to fulfi la regul atory commit ment to the PMDA to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of Q2W dosing in pat ients with GP and EPP. 3.2. Background Ixekizumab (LY2439821, Taltz ®) is a humanized immunoglobulin G subclass 4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (MAb) that binds with high affinit y and specificit y to interl eukin (IL) -17A,"
17,page_17,"I1F-JE-RHCV Clinical Protocol Page 17 LY2439821a proinflammatory cytokine . Ixekizumab does not bind to ligands IL -17B, IL -17C, IL- 17D, IL- 17E, or IL -17F. Phase 3 clinical studies show th at ixekizumab is efficacious and has an acceptable safet y profile for the treatm ent of adul t pati ents wi th moderate -to-severe Ps and for adult patients with act ive PsA. Ixekizumab wa s approved in Japan for the treatm ent of Ps,PsA, EP,and GPP at an init ial dose of ixekizumab 160 mg followed by ixekizumab 80 m g administered Q2W from Week 2 through Week 12, and thereafter 80 mg Q4W . In August 2018, a new dosage and administrati on was approved in Japan to support 80mg Q2W continued dosing bey ond Week 12 for patients with Ps, PsA, EP and GPP who have an inadequate response at Week 12 . However, clinical studi es consist ing of the main data package in this new approval did not include the data from patients wi th EP and GPP who underwent treatment of ixekizu mab 80 mg Q2W over 12 weeks . Therefore, t he PMDA agreed that Eli Lilly Japan woul d conduct a study to eval uate the use of ixekizumab Q2W dosing bey ond Week 12 in pat ients with EP and GPP in order to provide support for consistent dosing guidelines for thetreatm ent of all indicat ions(ie,Ps,PsA,EP,and GPP) with ixekizumab. 3.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment Continued 80 mg Q2W dosing of ixekizumab was shown to be more efficacious over 52 weeks of treatm ent com pared wi th continuous Q4W dosing in moderate -to-severe plaque psoriasis patients (Langley et al. 2018) . Clinically meaningful benefit fro m continued Q2W dosing beyo nd Week 12 was prominent in moderate -to-severe plaque psoriasis pat ients who had inadequate response at Week 12 . Although there are no data available for efficacy of ixekizumab Q2W dosing bey ond 12 weeks in EP and GPP patients, the long term efficacy data in plaque psoriasis pat ients are suggestive of theincremental efficacy o f ixekizumab with continued Q2W dosing in EP and GPP patients who have an inadequate response at Week 12 , over the initially approved dosing regimen. Safety profiles in plaque psoriasis pat ients who received ixekizumab Q2W over 52 weeks were comparable to those in Q4W treatment groups, with no unexpected safety signals observed . Meanwhile, no serious adverse events (S AEs)or adverse events ( AEs)leading to treatment discontinuat ion were reported fro m EP and G PP pati ents who received ixekizumab via the initially approved dosing regimen. Also, overall safet y profiles were comparable between EP and GPP patients and psoriasis pat ients. Given the expected clinical benefit, potential risks derived fro m continued Q2 W dosing may be acceptable in EP and GPP patients. More informat ion about the known and expected benefits, risks, SAEs and reasonably anticipated AEs of ixekizumab are to be found in the Invest igator’s Brochure (IB)."

Overall Design Study I1F-JE-RHCV is a mult icenter, open -label, pos t market ing clinical trialto eval uate the efficacy and safety of ixekizumab Q2W bey ond Week 12 until Week 20 in patients with GPP and EP . The study consists of 3 periods: Period 1 :Screening Period (Visit 1) last ing from 7to 30 day s prior to Peri od 2 (baseline; Week 0; Visit 2) Study investigator(s) will review patient history and screening test resul ts to determine if the patient meets all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria to qu alify for parti cipation in the study . Period 2: Induction Dosing Period from Week 0 (Visit 2) to Week 12 (Visit 6) All eligible pat ients will be administ ered 160 mg ixekizumab as 2 SC inject ions at Week 0 (baseline; Visit 2) fo llowed by 80 mg as 1 inject ion at Week 2, 4 , 6, 8 and 10. Period 3 : Maintenance Dosing Period fro m Week 12 to Week 20 Responders (GIS = 1 at Week 12) will co mplete the study . Inadeq uate responders (GIS ≥2 at Week 12 and based on invest igators’ discretion) will continue to use ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W during Period 3. If patients show a therapeutic response ( GIS = 1) with 80 mg Q2W after Week 12, the patient will complete the study. Patients who com plete the study before Week 20 will have an early terminat ion visit ( ETV ) instead of the original scheduled visit. Patients di scont inuing fro m the study treatm ent who have received at least 1 dose of investigat ional product will continue t o the ETV. Ixekizumab will not be made available after conclusion of the study to pati ents. Study governance considerations are described in detail in Appendix 3 .

Number of Participants A total o f 12 pati ents will be enrolled so that at least 5 patients with EP and 5 patients with GPP who are inadequate responders (GIS ≥2 at Week 12 and based on the invest igators’ discretion ), will cont inue to use ixekizuma bbeyo nd Week 12. A dditional enrollment may occur and sample size may be increased, if no GPP or EP patients enter into Peri od 3 (Maintenance Dosing Period) of the study . 5.3. End of Study Definition End of the study is the date o f the last visit or last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule o f Activities(Secti on2)for the last patient . 5.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design This is an open -label, single -arm study to primarily assess the efficacy of ixekizumab Q2W beyo nd Week 12 in pat ients with EP and GPP. The absence of a placebo arm is consistent with other studi es evaluat ing efficacy an d safet y of investigat ional drugs in these severe forms of Ps. In addi tion, pl acebo -controlled studies are not ethical for patients with EP and GPP. The Induct ion Dosing Period (Period 2) is based on the dosage and administration which w as approved via init ial regulatory review. This will be fo llowed by the Maintenance Dosing Period (Peri od 3), if pati ents do not show a therapeutic response (GIS ≥2 at Week 12 and based on the investigators’ discret ion)."

Justification for Dose The dosing schedule for Study RHCV was selected based on the initially approved dos age and administration of ixekizumab, and is designed to evaluate the response of patients wi th EP and GPP at Week 12 following the administration of ixekizumab atastarting dose of 1 60 m g followed by 80 m g Q2W up to Week 12 . Thereafter, according to the newly approved schedule, patients wi th an inadequate response will receive a dose of ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W up to and including Week 18,or un til they achieve a GIS score of 1 ."

Appendix 2 lists the laboratory tests that will be performed for this study . Unless otherwise stated in the subsect ions below, all samples collected for specified laboratory tests will be destroy ed wi thin 60 days of receipt of confirmed test result s. Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h applicable laws, regulat ions, or laboratory certificati on standards. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments 9.1.1. Primary Efficacy Assessment : Global Improvement Scores Global improvement scores will be assessed in the 4grades by co mpar ing the psoriat ic findings: (1) resolved, (2) improved, (3) unchanged, or(4) worsened. The global improvement score is assessed based on the comparison of the psoriat ic findings, Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA ), Psori asis Area and Severit y Index ( PASI )score, and other evaluat ions with those at the baseline. 9.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Assessments The fo llowing secondary and expl oratory efficacy measures will be assessed in this study : Psori asis Area and Severit y Index (PASI) Static Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) Scalp Psoriasis Severit y Index (PSSI) Percentage of Body Surf ace Area (BSA) GPP Severit y Index 9.1.2.1. Psoriasis Area and Severity Index The PASI combines an assessment of the extent of body surface involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head, trunk, arms, and legs) and the severity of desquamat ion (scaling), ery thema, and plaque indurati on/infiltrat ion (thi ckness ) in each regi on, yielding an overall score of 0 (no Ps) to 72 (the m ost severe disease) (Fredriksson and Pettersson 1978) . The PASI has been the most frequently used endpo int and m easure of Ps severity in clinical trials (EMEA 2004 [WWW]; Menter et al . 2008). 9.1.2.2. Static Physician Global Assessment The sPGA is the physician's determinat ion of the pati ent's Ps lesi ons overall at a given time point . The sPGA is recommended as an endpo int to use efficacy in the treatment of Ps (EME A 2004 [WWW]) . Overall lesio ns are categorized by descriptions for indurat ion, ery thema, and scaling . For analysis of responses, the patient's Ps is assessed as clear (0), minimal (1), mild (2), moderate (3), severe (4), or very severe (5)."
38,page_38,"I1F-JE-RHCV Clinical Protocol Page 38 LY24398219.1.2.3. Scalp Psorias is Severity Index If the patient has scalp Ps at baseline, the PSSI will be used . The PSSI is a co mposite score derived fro m the sum scores for ery thema, induration, and desquamation mult iplied by a score for the extent of t he scalp area invo lved (range 0 to 72). 9.1.2.4. Percentage of Body Surface Area The invest igator will evaluate the percentage invo lvement of Ps on each patient’s BSA on a continuous scale from 0% (no invo lvement) to 100% (full invo lvement), in which 1% corresponds to the size of the patient’s hand (including the palm, fingers and thumb) (Nat ional Psori asis Foundat ion 2009 [WWW]). 9.1.2.5. Generalized Pustular Psoriasis Severity Index The GPP Severit y Index will b e evaluated only for pati ents wi th pustul ar Ps at screening and at baseline. Thi s is a com posite score derived from the sum of scores for assessment of dermal symptoms, sy stemic symptoms, and laboratory findings (range, 0 to 17). Assessment of Dermal Symptoms Assessment of dermal symptoms, according to the Japanese Dermatological Associat ion GPP revi sed cri teria (2010) (Iwatsuki et al. 2010 [WWW]) will be evaluated only for patients wi th pustul ar Ps at screening and at baseline . Skin symptoms will be assessed by the score wi th the area of ery thema (on a 0 to 3 scale), area of confluent pustules (on a 0 to 3 scal e), and are of skin edema (on a 0 to 3scale ). The total score will be assessed (range ,0 to 9) . Systemic symptoms and laboratory findings Systemic symptom s and laboratory findings, according to the Japanese Dermatological Associ ation GPP revised criteria (2010) (Iwatsuki et al. 2010 [WWW]) will be evaluated only for pati ents wi th pustul ar Ps at screening and at baseline . It will be assessed by the score wi th fever (on a 0 to 2 scale), WBC (on a 0 to -2 scale), C -reactive protein (on a 0 to 2 scal e) and Alb umin (on a 0 to 2 scale) . The total score will be assessed (range, 0 to 8). 9.1.3. Appropriateness of Assessments All of the clinical and safet y assessments in this study are standard, widely used, and generally recogni zed as reliable, accurate, and relevant. 9.2. Adverse Events investi gator isresponsible for monitoring the safety of patientswho have entered this study and for alerting Lilly or i ts desi gnee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient. The invest igator will record all relevant AE/SAE informat ion in the CRF. The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of patientsduring the study. The i nvest igator must document his\herreview of each laboratory safet y report ."

The patientshoul d be f ollowed unt il the event resolves, stabilizes with appropriate diagnostic evaluation, or is reasonably explained. The frequency o f follow-up evaluat ions of the AE is left to the di scret ion of the invest igator. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish treatment effect. After the ICF is signed, study site personnel will record via electronic data entry the occurrence and nature of each patient ’s preexist ing condit ions, including clinically significant si gns and symptoms of the disease under treatment in the study . In addition, site perso nnel will record any change in the condit ion(s) and any new condit ions as AEs . The i nvest igator should record his\herassessment of the potential relatedness o f each AE to protocol procedure or investigat ional product, via electronic data entry . The invest igator will interpret and document whether or not an AE has a reasonable possibilit y of being related to study treatm ent, study device, or a study procedure, taki ng into account the disease, concomi tant treatm ent or pathologie s. A “reasonable possibilit y” means that there is a cause and effect relat ionship between the investigat ional product, study device and/or study procedure and the AE. The invest igator answers yes/ no when making this assessment. Planned surgeries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study . If a patient ’s investigational product is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must report this to Lilly or its designee via electronic data entry , clarifying if possible, the circumstances leading to any dosagemodificat ions, or di scont inuations of treatment. 9.2.1. Serious Adverse Events An SAE is any AE from this study that resul ts in one of the fo llowing outcom es: death initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalizat ion a life- threatening experience (that is, immedi ate ri sk of dying) persistent or significant disabilit y/incapacit y congenital ano maly/birth defect"

Examples of such m edical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at hom e, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not resul t in inpat ient hospi talizat ion, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. when a condit ion related to the prefilled syringes necessitates medical or surgi cal interventi on to precl ude ei ther perm anent impai rment of a body funct ion or permanent dama ge to a body structure, the seri ous outcom e of “required intervent ion” will be assigned. All AEs occurring after signing the ICF are recorded in the electroni c data entry and assessed for serious cri teria. The SAE reporting to the sponsor begins after the patient has signed the ICF and has received invest igational product. However, if an SAE occurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving invest igational product, th e SAE should be reported to the sponsor as per SAE reporting requirements and t imelines (see Sect ion 9.2) if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study procedure. Study site personnel must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of any SAE within 24 hours of invest igator awareness o f the event via a sponsor -approved method. If alerts are issued via telephone, they are to b e immediately fo llowed wi th official notificati on on study -specific SAE forms. This 24 - hour notificat ion requirement refers to the init ial SAE informat ion and all fo llow-up SAE inform ation.Patients with a seri ous hepat ic AEshoul d have addi tional data c ollected using the electroni c data entry . Pregnancy ( during maternal or paternal exposure to invest igational product) does not meet the definit ion of an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements any pregnancy should be reported fo llowing the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus. Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in patients once they have discontinued and/or completed the study (the patientdisposit ion CRF has been completed). However, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a patient has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably possibly related to the study treatm ent or study parti cipat ion, the invest igator m ust prom ptly notify Lilly . 9.2.1.1. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies as related to investigational product or study procedure. United States 21 CFR 312.32 and European Unio n Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC and the associated detailed guidances or nati onal regulatory requi rements in participat ing countries require the reporting of SUSARs. Lilly has procedures that will be followed for the identificat ion, recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with global regulat ions and the associated detailed guidances."
41,page_41,"I1F-JE-RHCV Clinical Protocol Page 41 LY24398219.2.2. Adverse Events of Special Interest The fo llowing AEs of special interest (AESIs) will be used t o determine the safet y and tolerabilit y of ixekizumab over the range of doses selected for this clinical study . Adverse events of special interest for ixekizumab are: cytopeni as (leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocy topeni a) liver funct ion test changes/enzyme elevat ions (ALT, AST, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase) infect ion inject ion-site reacti ons allergic reactions/hypersensit ivities cerebrocardiovascular events malignancies inflammatory bowel disease depressio n interstitial lung disease (IL D). If infections, inject ion-site reacti ons, or allergic/hypersensit ivity react ions are reported, sites will provi de details on these events as instructed on the CRF. Invest igators will also educate patients and/or careg ivers about the symptoms of allergic/hypersensit ivity react ions and will provide instructi ons on dealing wit h these react ions. A blo od sam ple will be collected when possible for any pat ient who experiences an AE of allergic/hypersensit ivity react ions duri ng the study . Data on preferred terms associated with cerebrocardiovascular events (defined as death, cardiac ischemic events including MI and hospitalization for unstable angina, hospitalizat ion for heart failure, serious arrhy thmia, resuscitated sudden d eath, cardi ogenic shock, coronary revascularization procedure, stroke/transient ischemic attack, peripheral revascularization procedure, and peripheral arterial event and hospitalizat ion for hypertensi on) will be collected, and these events and any deaths will be adjudicated by an external Clinical Events Committee (CEC) m ade up of a chairman, 2 cardio logists, and a neurologist. Data on suspected IBD, as identified by events possibly indicat ive of ulcerative colit is and Crohn’s disease, wil l be co llected and the events will be adjudicated by an external CEC with expert ise in IBD. The rol e of external CECs is to adj udicate defined clinical events in a blinded, consistent, and unbiased manner throughout the course of a study . The purpose of the CEC for adjudicat ion of cerebrocardiovascular events and the CEC for adjudicat ion of suspected IBD events is to ensure that all reported events are evaluated uniformly by a single group."
42,page_42,"I1F-JE-RHCV Clinical Protocol Page 42 LY24398219.2.3. Complaint Handling Lilly co llects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery systems used in clinical studies in order to ensure the safet y of study parti cipants, m onitor quali ty, and to facilitate process and product improvements. A patient will be instructed to contact the invest igator as soon as possible if he or she has a complaint or probl em wi th the invest igational product or drug delivery system so that the situation can be assessed. 9.3. Treatment of Overdose Refer to the TaltzIBand/or Product Label . 9.4. Safety 9.4.1. Electrocardiograms For each patient, electrocardiograms (ECGs) should be collected locally according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on 2). Patients are to be rest ing for 5 minutes prior to the ECG . It is recommended that patients be in a supine position. The qualified physician must document his/her review of the ECG at the time of screening. The ECG resul tswill be stored at the site and would be made available to the sponsor as requested .The invest igators are allowed to repeat the ECG collect ion. 9.4.2. Vital Signs For each patient, vital signs measurements should be conducte d according to the Schedule o f Activities (Secti on 2). Vital signs (BP and pulse) and body temperature will be measured (sitting) after resting for a minimum o f 10 minutes at times indicated in the Schedule of Activities (Sect ion 2). At baseline (Week 0; Visit 2), BP and pulse should be measured prior to administration of the invest igational product an d again approximately 1 hour after administration . Any clinically significant findings from vital signs m easurement that result in a diagnosis and that occur after the patient receives the first dose of study treatm ent shoul d be reported to Lilly or its d esignee as an AE viaCRF. 9.4.3. Laboratory Tests For each patient, laboratory tests detailed in ( Appendix 2 ) shoul d be conducted according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on 2). Lilly or its desi gnee will provide the investi gator wi th the resul ts of laboratory tests analyzed by a central vendor, if a central vendor is used for the clinical trial. Any clinically significant findings from laboratory test s that result in a diagnosis and that occur after the pati ent receives the first dose of invest igatio nal product should be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE via CRF ."
43,page_43,"I1F-JE-RHCV Clinical Protocol Page 43 LY24398219.4.4. Immunogenicity Assessments Samples for immunogeni city testing will be collected at time points indicated in the Schedule of Activities (Section 2). Venous blood samples will be co llected into tubes and used to determine antibody producti on against ixekizumab . The actual date of each sampling will be recorded on the laboratory requisi tion. Immunogenicit y will be assessed by a valida ted assay designed to detect ADAs in the presence of ixekizumab. Antibodies may be further characterized and/or evaluated for their abilit y to neutralize the activit y of ixekizumab. Treatment -emergent immunogenicit y is defined as any occurrence of a 4- fold or 2 dilution increase in titer over the pretreatment baseline t iter. In the case of a negative result at baseline, treatment -emergent immunogenicit y is defined as an increase in titer to ≥1:10. Immunogenicit y samples will also be analyzed for ixekizu mab serum concentration to facilitate the interpretation of the immunogenicit y data at Week 12 (Visit 6), Week 20 (Visit 10)and ETV . In the event of serious drug hypersensit ivity react ions (such as generali zed urti caria and/or anaphylaxis) ,additional s amples will be collected as close to the onset of the event as possible and approximately 30 days fo llowing the event to evaluate ant idrug ant ibodies (ADA), LY2439821 serum concentration, and addit ional expl oratory biomarkers of hypersensit ivity which coul d include try ptase, com plement l evels and cy tokine m easurements . Samples will be retained for a m aximum of 15 y ears after the last patient visit, or for a shorter period if local regulat ions and ERBs allow, at a facilit y selected by the sponsor. The durati on allows the sponsor to respond to future regulatory requests rel ated to ixekizumab . Any samples remaining after 15 y ears will be destroy ed. 9.4.5. Other Safety Measures 9.4.5.1. Physical Exam One co mplete physical examinat ion (excluding pelvic, rectal, and breast examinat ions) will be perform ed at screening . This examinat ion will determine whether the patient meets the criteria requi red to parti cipate in the study and will also serv e as a m onitor for pre -exist ing condit ions and as a baseline for treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) assessment. All physical examinat ions throughout the study shoul d include a symptom -directed physical evaluat ion, as well as an examinat ion of the hea rt, lungs, abdo men, and a visual examinat ion of the skin. 9.4.5.2. Chest X -Ray and Tuberculosis Testing A posteri or-anterior view chest X -ray will be obtained, unless the X -ray or resul ts from a chest X-ray obtained wit hin 6 mont hs pri or to the study are available. The chest X -ray will be obtained locally . The chest X -ray or resul ts will be reviewed by the invest igator or designee to exclude pat ients with active TB infect ion. In the opinio n of the investigator, if evaluat ing chest X-ray is medically necessary , the invest igator may do so any time during the study. In addit ion, pati ents will be locally tested at screening and at visits, as indicated on the Schedule of Activities (Secti on 2)for evidence of active or latent TB indicated by a posi tive purified protein derivat ive(PPD)skin-test response ( ≥5 mm indurat ion, between approximately 48 and"

If, in the judgment of the investigator, an interferon gamma release assay (Quant iFERON -TB Gol d test) i s preferred as an alternat ive to the PPD skin test for the evaluat ion of TB infect ion, it may be used instead of the PPD test (posit ive tests excluded) and woul dbe read locally . If an interferon gamma release assay (QuantiFERON -TB Gol d test) is indeterminate, 1 retest is allowed. The same method shoul d be used at the retest . If the retest i s indeterminate, then the patient is excluded fro m the study . Patients wi th docum entati on of a negat ive test result within 3 months prior to baseline (Week 0; Visit 2) do not need a TB screen at Visit 1. Documentation of this test result m ust incl ude a record of the size of the induration response. A PPD test recorded as negative wit hout docum enting the size of indurat ion will result in a retest. However, patients with a PPD skin test ≥5 mm indurati on or a p ositive Quant iFERON -TB Gol d test at screening, but no other evidence of act ive TB, may be rescreened 1 time and may be enrolled without repeating the PPD or QuantiFERON -TB GOLD test if the fo llowing condi tions are met: after receiving at least 4 weeks of a ppropri ate latent TB infecti on (LTBI) therapy , having no evidence of hepatotoxicit y (ALT/AST must remain ≤2 times ULN) upon retesting of serum ALT/AST prior to administration of invest igational product . Such patients m ust com plete appropri ate LTBI therapy during the course of the study in order to rem ain eligible, and meet ing all other Inclusio n/Exclusio n criteria for parti cipat ion. Patients who have a documented history of com pleting an appropriate TB treatment regimen with no history of re-exposure to TB since their treatment was completed and no evidence of active TB are eligible to participate in the study . These patients should not undergo TB testing at screening or at l ater scheduled visits in the study , as per the Schedule of Activities (Section 2). Patients who have had household contact with a person with active TB are excluded, unless appropriate and documented prophylaxis for TB was given . 9.4.5.3. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale The C -SSRS is a scale that captures the occurrence, severit y, and frequency of suicidal ideation and/or behavior during the assessment period. The scale includes suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to determine if suicidal ideat ion and/or behavior occurred. The C-SSRS is administered by an appropriately trained healt hcare professio nal wit h at l east 1 y ear of patient care/clinical experi ence. The tool was developed by the National Inst itute of Mental Health trial group (TASA) for the purpose of being a counterpart to the Columbia Classificat ion Algori thm of Suicide Assessment categorizat ion of sui cidal events. Patients will be as sessed according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on 2). The Self -Harm Supplement Form is a 1- question form that asks for the number of suicida l or nonsuicidal self -injuri ous behavi ors the patient has experienced since the last assessment. For each unique event ident ified, a questionnaire (Self -Harm Follow-Up Form ) which collects suppl emental informat ion on the self -"

The Self -Harm Suppl ement Form will be com pleted according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on 2). The non -leading AE collect ion shoul d occur pri or to the collect ion of the C -SSRS. If a suicide-related event is discovered during the C - SSRS, but was not captured during the non- leading AE collect ion, sites shoul d not change the AE form. If an event is s erious or l eads to discontinuat ion, thi s is an except ion where the SAE and/or AE leading to discont inuat ion should be included on the AE form and the process for reporting SAEs should be fo llowed. 9.4.5.4. Hepatitis B Screening Patients who test HBsAg, HBcAb + in conjunct ion with posi tive confirmatory HBV DNA test, or have posit ive HBV DNA test, regardless of HBsAb status, at screening will be excluded. If an enrolled pat ient is posit ive for HBsAb and/or HBcAb, and negat ive for HBV DNA, the HBV DNA needs to be checked at least once every month in Periods 2 and 3 (See Secti on2). In addit ion to the above, any enrolled pat ient who is HBcAb+ and /or HBsAb+ and who experiences an elevated ALT or AST level >3x ULN m ust undergo HBV DNA testing. If the HBV DNA test is negat ive, the invest igator should consult with the Lilly -designated me dical monitor regarding further management of the patient. If the result of the HBV DNA testing is posit ive, the patient must be discont inued fro m the study and should receive appropriate fo llow-up m edical care, including considerat ion for antiviral therapy. A specialist physician in the care of patients with hepatit is (for example, infect ious disease or hepatologist subspecialists) should be consulted and potentially start antiviral therapy prior to di scontinuati on of any immunosuppressant therapy (incl uding study drug). Timing of discontinuat ion from the study and of any immunosuppressant therapy (including study drug) needs to be based on the recommendat ions of the consult ing specialist physician in conjunct ion with the invest igator and medical guidelines/standard of care . 9.4.5.5. Hepatitis C Screening Patients who test posi tive for HCV antibody and have a posi tive confirmatory HCV RNA test at screening will be excluded. Patients wi th a previ ous diagnosi s of hepat itis C who have b een treated wi th antiviral therapy and achieved a sustained virologic response may be eligible for inclusio n in the study , provi ded they have no detectable RNA on the screening HCV RNA test for this protocol. A sustained virologic response is defined as a n undetectable HCV RNA level, 12 weeks after complet ion of a full, documented course of an approved ant iviral therapy for HCV. Patients who have spontaneously cleared HCV infection, defined as (i) a posit ive HCV ant ibody test and (ii) a negat ive HCV RNA test, wi th no history of anti-HCV treatm ent, m ay be eligible for inclusio n in the study , provi ded they have no detectable HCV RNA on screening for this study , and no detectable HCV RNA on the screening HCV RNA test for this protocol .

49,page_49,"I1F-JE-RHCV Clinical Protocol Page 49 LY24398219.9.1. Itch Numeric Rating Scale The Itch NRS is a patient -administered, 11 -point hori zontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 represent ing “no itch” and 10 represent ing “worst itch imaginable.” Overall severit y of a patient's i tching from Ps is indicated by circling the number that bes t describes the worst level of itching in the past 24 hours. 9.9.2. Dermatology Life Quality Index The DLQI is a simple, patient -administered, 10 -question, validated, qualit y-of-life quest ionnaire that covers 6 domains, includin g symptom s and feelings, daily act ivities, leisure, work and school , personal relationships, and treatm ent. Response categories include “not at all”, “a litt le”, “a lot”, and “very much”, wi th corresponding scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and unan swered (“not relevant”) responses scored as “0.” Totals range fro m 0 to 30 (the higher the score, the more qualit y of life is impaired) and a 5 -point change from baseline is considered clinically relevant (Basra et al. 2008)."
50,page_50,"I1F-JE-RHCV Clinical Protocol Page 50 LY243982110.Statistical Considerations 10.1. Sample Size Determination A total o f 12 pati ents will be enrolled so that at least 5 patients with EP and 5 patients with GPP who are inadequate responders (GIS ≥2 at Week 12 and based on investigators’ discret ion)will continue to use ixekizumab beyo nd Week 12 . Addit ional enro llment may occur and the sample size m ay be increased, if no GPP or EP patients enter into Period 3 (Maintenance Dosing Period) of the study . The sample size is based on the following: In the I1F-JE-RHAT ( RHAT )study , 5 GPP and 8 EP patients were enrolled. One GPP patient achieved GIS = 1 (resolved) at Week 12 and the other 4 GPP patients achieved GIS = 2 (improved). One EP patient achieved GIS = 1 at Week 12 and 7 EP pati ents achieved GIS = 2. Although the sample size is very small, based on the result of RHAT study , it is assumed that approximately 5 patients at maximum may not achi eve GIS = 1 at Week 12 and may continue ixekizumab Q2W beyo nd Week 12 based on the investigators’ discret ion. The sample size is determined based on the feasibilit y in Japan. The prevalence rate of these patients is very low in Japan and it is also difficult to conduct a placebo -controlled study for these severe condit ions (Umezawa et al. 2003, Rosenbach et al. 2010). 10.2. Populations for Analyses For purposes of analysis, the following populat ions are defined: Efficacy, health outcomes and safet y analyses for Period 2 will be conducted on the largest analysis set (Full Analysis Set [FAS]), defined as the set of patients with GPP and EP separately who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment in Peri od 2 (FAS Populat ion). Efficacy, health outcomes and safet y analyses for Period 3 will be conduc ted based on patients with GPP and EP separately who receive at l east 1 dose of study treatm ent in Peri od 3 (Maintenance Dosing Period Populat ion). 10.3. Statistical Analyses 10.3.1. General Statistical Considerations Statistical analysis o f this study will be the responsibilit y of Eli Lilly Japan . Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protoc ol. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol, and the just ification for making the change, will be described in the clinical study report (CSR) . Additional exploratory analyses of the data will be conducted as deemed approp riate. Primary analysis o f efficacy, health outcome ,and safet y measures will be conducted based on patients who continued ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W bey ond Week 12 by disease ty pe (ie, GPP and"
51,page_51,"I1F-JE-RHCV Clinical Protocol Page 51 LY2439821EPsepar ately)on the Maintenance Dosing Period Populat ion. Secondary analyses of efficacy, healt h outcom e,and safet y measures will be conducted for Period 2 on the FAS Populat ion and Period 3 on the Maintenance Dosing Period Population, respectively. Baseline for efficacy, healt h outcomes ,and safet y analyses in Period 2 is defined as the last available value before first dose in Period 2; in most cases, it will be the value recorded at Week 0 (Visit 2). For the efficacy and healt h outcomes analyses in Period 3, baseline is defined as the last available value before the first dose in Period 2 and, in most cases, will be the value recorded at Week 0 (Visit 2). Unless otherwise specified, for the safet y analyses during Period 3, baseline is defined as the last available value before the first dose of ixekizumab in Period 3. In most cases, this will be the measure recorded at Week 12 (Visit 6). As thi s is a single arm stu dy with very small sample si ze, no statistical inference will be perform ed. Continuous data will be summarized in terms of the mean, standard deviat ion, minimum, maximum, median, and number of observat ions. Categorical data will be summarized as frequency counts. 10.3.2. Patients 10.3.2.1. Patient Disposition A detailed description o f patient di sposi tion will be provi ded at the end of the study . 10.3.2.2. Patient Characteristics Patient characteri stics and baseline clinical measure swill be summarized. Baseline characterist ics will include gender, age, height, weight, baseline disease severit y, durati on of disease, previous systemic therapy , and previ ous bi ologic therapy . Baseline clinical and heal th outcom e measurements will include PASI , sPGA ,BSA , PSSI, Itch NRS ,DLQI , C-SSRS, and GPP severit y index . 10.3.2.3. Concomitant Therapy Previous and concomitant medicat ions will be summarized and presented by World Heal th Organiza tion Anatomical Therapeut ic Class (WHOATC) and generic name. 10.3.2.4. Treatment Compliance Treatment compliance wit h study drug will be summarized for patients who enter Periods 2 and 3(Induction Dosing Period and Maintenance Dosing Period), respectively . Overall com pliance with therapy is defined to be missing no more than 20% of the expected doses and not missing 2 consecut ive doses , and does not overdose (that is, take more inject ions at the same time po int than specified in the protoco l). 10.3.3. Efficacy Analyses 10.3.3.1.

Othersafet y measures including the detailed AEs will be reviewed by listings . Summaries of overall AEs will be created for Period 2 on the FAS Populat ion and for Period 3 on the Maintenance Dosing Period Popul ation, respectively. 10.3.4.1. Adverse Events Adverse events are classified based upon the Medica l Dictionary for Regul atory Activities (MedDRA) . A TEAE is defined as an event that first occurred or worsened in severit y after baseline and on or prior to the date of the last visit within the treatment period . Both the date/time of the event onset and the date/time of the first study drug inject ion are considered when determining TEAEs . Treatment -emergent adverse events will be assigned to the treatment period in which they first occurred or worsened. An overall summary o f AEs will be provided for eac h of the treatment periods, including the number of patients who experienced TEAEs, TEAEs by maximum severit y, deaths, SAEs, TEAEs related to study drug, di scontinuat ions from the treatment due to an AE, and treatment - emergent AESIs .
