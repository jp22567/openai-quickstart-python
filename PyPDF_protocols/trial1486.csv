The medical and societal impacts are considerable and obesity is one of the most significant public health challenges worldwide1-7. Obesity is associated with increased risk of a variety of comorbidities including hyperglycaemia, T2D, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, urinary incontinence, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cardiovascular diseases, certain types of cancer, and risk of early death 8-22. Moreover, obesity adversely affects physical and mental health and reduces health related quality of life23, 24. Obesity is also associated with decreased cardiorespiratory fitness, which also increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality25. The risk of obesity-related complications and comorbi dities increases with increasing BMI, and a weight loss of 5-10% has significant health benefits in terms of slowing progression to T2D26-29. Furthermore, a weight loss of 5-10% improves many other obesity related comorbidities as well as physical symptoms and quality of life 30-37. Finally, studies suggest a beneficial impact of weight loss on cardiovascular risk and mortality in both people with diabetes and obesity38-40. Subjects with T2D often have multiple unmet medical needs related to cardiovascular risks, including hypertension and dyslipidemia. It has been consistently demonstrated that weight loss in subjects with T2D has a beneficial impact not only on glycaemic control, but also on other cardiovascular risk markers 41. The present trial has been designed to show the effects of semaglutide in inducing weight loss in overweight or obese subjects with T2D, while potentially improving markers of cardiovascular risk, clinical outcome assessments and glycaemic control. Objectives and endpoints: Primary objective To compare the effect of semaglutide subcutaneous (s.c.) 2.4 mg once-weekly versus semaglutide placebo I/II as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in subjects with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) on body weight. Secondary objectives To compare the effect of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once-weekly versus semaglutide placebo I/II as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in subjects with overweight or obesity and T2D on: !Cardiovascular risk factors !Clinical Outcome Assessments !Glycaemic control 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

To compare the effect of semaglutide s.c. 1.0 mg once-weekly versus semaglutide placebo I/II as an adjunct to reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in subjects with overweight or obesity and T2D on glycaemic control. To compare the safety and tolerability of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once-weekly versus semaglutide placebo I/II as an adjunct to reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in subjects with overweight or obesity and T2D. Primary estimand The estimand will quantify the average treatment effect of semaglutide relative to semaglutide placebo after 68 weeks, as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, in all randomised subjects regardless of adherence to treatment and regardless of starting rescue interventions (weight management drugs or bariatric surgery) (‚Äúeffectiveness‚Äù/‚Äútreatment policy‚Äù estimand). The estimand will cover all effect-related objectives. The following expansion of the primary estimand will cover objectives related to weight. The estimand will quantify the average treatment effect of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg relative to semaglutide s.c. 1.0 mg after 68 weeks, as an adjunct to reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity, in all randomised subjects regardless of adherence to treatment and regardless of starting rescue interventions. Primary endpoint The primary endpoints addressing the primary objective: !Change from baseline (week 0) to week 68 in body weight (%) !Subjects who after 68 weeks achieve (yes/no): oBody weight reduction F 5% from baseline (week 0) Confirmatory secondary endpoints The confirmatory secondary endpoints are used to compare effect of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once- weekly versus semaglutide placebo I/II unless stated otherwise. !Subjects who after 68 weeks achieve (yes/no): oBody weight reduction F 10% from baseline (week 0) oBody weight reduction F 15% from baseline (week 0) !Change from baseline (week 0) to week 68 in: oWaist circumference (cm) 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

The trial includes a screening period of approximately 1 week followed by randomisation. Eligible subjects fulfilling all randomisation criteria at visit 2 will be randomised in a 1:1:1 manner to receive either: oSemaglutide 2.4 mg and semaglutide placebo II once-weekly oSemaglutide 1.0 mg and semaglutide placebo I once-weekly oSemaglutide placebo I and semaglutide placebo II once-weekly all as an adjunct to a reduced- calorie diet and increased physical activity ( Figure 5-1 ). Randomisation will be stratified according to the following background diabetes treatment: !diet and physical activity only or treatment with single compound metformin or sodium- glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) treatment or !single compound oral antidiabetic drug (OAD ) treatment (sulphonylurea (SU) or glitazone) or combination treatment with of up to 3 OADs (metformin, SU, SGLT2i or glitazone) Subjects in the two above stratification groups will be further stratified into 2 groups by screening value of HbAlc (A. < 8.5% or B. F 8.5%). Proportion of subjects treated with SU mono- or combination therapy will be restricted to a maximum of 30% of total randomised subjects. When the SU target is reached subjects treated with SU as background treatment should not be randomised to this trial. Dose escalation of semaglutide/semaglutide placebo will take place every 4 weeks during the first 8-16 weeks after randomisation, depending on target dose 1.0 or 2.4 mg once-weekly. All subjects should aim at reaching the target dose of semaglu tide 1.0 mg or 2.4 mg onc e-weekly. T he treatment continues until the ‚Äòend of treatment‚Äô visit followed by a 7 weeks follow-up period.

The medical and societal impacts are considerable and obesity is one of the most significant public health challenges worldwide1-7. Obesity is associated with increased risk of a variety of comorbidities including hyperglycaemia, T2D, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, urinary incontinence, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cardiovascular diseases, certain types of cancer, and risk of early death 8-22. Moreover, obesity adversely affects physical and mental health and reduces health related quality of life23, 24. Obesity is also associated with decreased cardiorespiratory fitness, which also increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality25. The risk of obesity-related complications and comorbi dities increases with increasing BMI, and a weight loss of 5-10% has significant health benefits in terms of slowing progression to T2D26-29. Furthermore, a weight loss of 5-10% improves many other obesity related comorbidities as well as physical symptoms and quality of life 30-37. Finally, studies suggest a beneficial impact of weight loss on cardiovascular risk and mortality in both people with diabetes and obesity38-40. Subjects with T2D often have multiple unmet medical needs related to cardiovascular risks, including hypertension and dyslipidemia. It has been consistently demonstrated that weight loss in subjects with T2D has a beneficial impact not only on glycaemic control, but also on other cardiovascular risk markers 41. The present trial has been designed to show the effects of semaglutide in inducing weight loss in overweight or obese subjects with T2D, while potentially improving markers of cardiovascular risk, clinical outcome assessments and glycaemic control. Lifestyle intervention in the form of diet and exercise is first line treatment for obesity, but most people with obesity struggle to achieve and maintain their weight loss43-52. Surgical treatments offer an effective alternative for some people with severe obesity, but surgery carries a risk in connection with the procedure and is not without complications. Furthermore, surgery requires close follow-up of the individual which can be cumbersome and costly43-48, 53, 54. Pharmacotherapy may therefore serve as a valuable adjunct to lifestyle intervention for individuals with obesity in order to achieve and sustain a clinically relevant weight loss, to improve comorbid conditions and to facilitate a healthier lif estyle. Few anti-obesity medications are curre ntly available and there is a need for more safe and effective therapeutic options for treatment of obesity, especially treatments that also target weight maintenance, prevention and treatment of comorbidities 43-47, 55, 56. 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

Semaglutide has been optimised resulting in a longer half-life of approximately 160 hours, making it suitable for once-weekly dosing 57. GLP-1 receptor agonist is a physiological regulator of appetite and GLP-1 receptors are present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation58. In subjects with T2D, treatment with semaglutide s.c. 1.0 mg once-weekly has shown a body weight loss of up to 7.0% of baseline body weight (and reductions in haemoglobin HbA 1cof up to 1.85 percentage-point) after 30 weeks with a safety and tolerability profile comparable to other GLP-1 RA59-63. In the trials investigating semaglutide s.c. 1.0 mg, subjects with diabetes were exposed to a lower dose of semaglutide for a shorter period and did not receive any dedicated lifestyle intervention. Consequently, body weight loss is expected to be greater in a population of subjects with T2D receiving a dedicated lifestyle intervention and a higher semaglutide dose. A 52-week phase 2 dose-finding trial within weight management (NN9536-4153) has recently been completed. A total of 957 randomised subjects with obesity (without diabetes) were exposed to semaglutide (n=718), liraglutide 3.0 mg (n=103) or placebo (n=136). In this trial, an overall monotone dose-dependent weight loss was observed across the 5 semaglutide doses tested (0.05 to 0.4 mg once-daily). The estimated weight loss at week 52 was 13.8% at the highest dose tested (0.4 mg once-daily) 64compared to the weight loss of 2.3% achieved by diet, exercise and placebo alone. Clinical59-63and non-clinical data65indicate that the body weight-reducing effect of semaglutide is mainly mediated by a reduced energy intake. No unexpected safety findings were identified and the tolerability and safety profile was overall consistent with previous findings in the T2D development programme and the GLP-1 RA class in general. A comprehensive review of results from the non-clinical and clinical studies of semaglutide can be found in the current edition of the investigator‚Äôs brochure (IB) 64and any updates hereof. 3.2.2 Trial population In the present trial, T2D is considered a comorbidity to overweight and obesity, therefore subjects with BMI F 27 kg/m2will be in enrolled. Information about other weight-related com orbidities, including hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea or cardiovascular disease, will be collected systematically at screening by the investigators as part of the medical history. Subjectstreated with insulin are not included in the trial as insulin promotes weight gain. However, as last rescue treatment option, insulin treatment can be initiated. 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

Thus, only subjects who have tried but failed a dietary weight loss intervention w ill be included in accordance with regulatory guidelines66, 67. 3.3 Benefit-risk assessment 3.3.1 Benefits Subjects will be treated with a regimen anticipated to be better than or equal to the weight management they receive at the time of entry into the trial. Results from the phase 2 trial (NN9536-4153) demonstrated that semaglutide once-daily as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity was effective for weight lo ss in subjects with obesity, while displaying a satisfactory tolerability profile. Overall, a monotone dose-dependent weight loss was observed across all tested doses of semaglutide (0.05 to 0.4 mg once-daily). The weight loss was 11.55 percentage points larger for the 0.4 mg group compared with placebo. Weight losses were accompanied by a consistent improvement in the weight-related comorbidities, indicated by cardiovascular risk factors, lipid profile and glycaemic factors, as well as improvements in clinical outcome assessments. In addition, it is expected that all subjects will benefit from participation through close contact with the trial site and counselling by a dietician or a similar qualified healthcare professional, all of which will most likely result in intensified weight management. 3.3.2 Risks and precautions The sections below describe identified and potential risks associated with semaglutide treatment. The identified/potential risks are based on findings in non-clinical studies and clinical trials with semaglutide as well as other GLP-1 RAs. For each of these risks, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial. Identified risks !Gastrointestinal adverse events Consistent with findings with other GLP-1 RAs, the most frequently reported adverse events (AE) in clinical trials with semaglutide were gastrointestinal AEs. A low starting dose and dose escalation steps will be implemented in the trial to mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs. !Cholelithiasis Events of cholelithiasis were the most frequently reported gallbladder events in the phase 2 weight management trial (NN9536-4153) and were in a few instances co-reported with the event adjudication committee (EAC) confirmed acute pancreatitis. As a precaution, if cholelithiasis is suspected, appropriate clinical follow-up is to be initiated at the investigator‚Äôs discretion. !Hypoglycaemia (in combination with SU and/or insulin) (identified for T2D patients) There is a low risk of hypoglycaemic episodes when semaglutide is used as monotherapy. Subjects treated with semaglutide in combination with a sulphonylurea (SU) or insulin have an increased risk 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"
18,page_18,"Protocol CONFIDENTIALDate: 21 December 2017 Novo Nordisk Trial ID: NN9536-4374 Version: 2.0 Status: Final Page: 17 of 113 of hypoglycaemia. The risk of hypoglycaemia can be lowered by reducing the dose of SU when initiating treatment with semaglutide (or insulin if subjects have been allowed to use insulin as rescue therapy). !Diabetic retinopathy complication (identified for T2D patients) The cardiovascular outcome trial in the semaglutide T2D development programme showed an increased risk of events related to diabetic retinopathy complications in subjects treated with semaglutide compared to placebo, albeit the proportion of subjects with an event of diabetic retinopathy complications was low. The imbalance was driven by subjects with a history of diabetic retinopathy at baseline and subjects who were treated with insulin. As a precaution, subjects with a history of uncontrolled and potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy will be excluded from the trial, and fundus photography or slit-lamp biomicroscopy examination with pharmacologically dilated pupils will be performed according to flowchart (Section 2and 9.4.5 ). !Acute pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been observed with the use of GLP-1 RA drug class. As a precaution, subjects with a history of chronic pancreatitis or recent acute pancreatitis will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, trial product should be discontin ued in case of suspicion of acute pancreatitis in accordance to Section 8.1. Potential risks !Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) (based on non-clinical data) Expected proliferative thyroid C-cell changes were seen in the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies after daily exposure to semaglutide for 2 years. No hyperplasia was observed in monkeys after 52 weeks exposure up to 13-fold above the clinical plasma exposure at 2.4 mg/week. In clinical trials with semaglutide, there have been no reports of MTC or clinically relevant changes in calcitonin levels. The C-cell changes in rodents are mediated by the GLP-1 receptor, which is not expressed in the normal human thyroid. Accordingly, the risk of GLP-1 receptor-mediated C- cell changes in humans is considered to be low. However, as a precaution, exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to medical history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type2 (MEN 2) or MTC and elevated plasma levels of calcitonin (biomarker for MTC) have been implemented in the trial. !Pancreatic cancer There is currently no support from non-clinical studies, clinical trials or post-marketing data that GLP-1 RA-based therapies increase the risk of pancreatic cancer, but pancreatic cancer has been classified as a potential class risk of GLP-1 RAs by European Medicines Agency. As a precaution, subjects with a history of malignant neoplasms wi thin the past 5 years prior to screening will be excluded from the trial. !Allergic reactions As is the case with all protein-based pharmaceuticals, subjects treated with semaglutide are at risk of developing immunogenic and allergic reactions. As a precaution, subjects with known or suspected hypersensitivity to semaglutide or related products will not be enrolled in this trial. 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"
19,page_19,"Protocol CONFIDENTIALDate: 21 December 2017 Novo Nordisk Trial ID: NN9536-4374 Version: 2.0 Status: Final Page: 18 of 113 Other risks !Pregnancy and fertility (based on non-clinical data) Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. There are limited data from the use of semaglutide in pregnant women. Therefore, semaglutide should not be used during pregnancy. Exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to pregnancy have been implemented in the trial. 3.3.3 Conclusion on benefit-risk profile Necessary precautions have been implemented in the design and planned conduct of the trial in order to minimise the risks and inconveniences of participation in the trial. The safety profile for semaglutide generated from the clinical and non-clinical development programme has not revealed any safety issues that would prohibit administration of semaglutide 2.4 mg once-weekly. The results of the phase 2 trial (NN9536-4153) indicate that semaglutide will provide a clinically meaningful weight loss. In conclusion, the potential risk to the subjects in this trial is considered low and outweighed by the anticipated benefits that semaglutide woul d provide subjects included in the trial. More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected AEs of semaglutide may be found in the IB 64and any updates hereof . 4 Objectives and endpoints 4.1 Primary, secondary and exploratory objective(s) 4.1.1 Primary objective To compare the effect of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once-weekly versus semaglutide placebo I/II (please see the last paragraph in this section for an explanation of placebo I and II) as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in subjects with overweight or obesity and T2D on body weight. 4.1.2 Secondary objectives To compare the effect of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once-weekly versus semaglutide placebo I/II as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in subjects with overweight or obesity and T2D on: !Cardiovascular risk factors !Clinical Outcome Assessments !Glycaemic control To compare the effect of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once-weekly versus semaglutide s.c. 1.0 mg once- weekly as an adjunct to reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity in subjects with overweight or obesity and T2D on factors related to body weight. 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

A 68-week treatment duration (in cluding 52 weeks on target dose) is considered sufficient to assess weight loss, safety and tolerability in the phase 3 weight management development programme in accordance with regulatory guidelines 66, 67. A randomised, double-blinded, double dummy, placebo-controlled, multi-centre trial design is chosen to minimise bias in the assessment of the effect and safety of semaglutide 2.4 mg, semaglutide 1.0 mg, and semaglutide placebo I/II once- weekly, as an adjunct to a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity. The trial includes a screening visit to assess the subject‚Äôs eligibility followed by visits/phone contacts every second week during dose escalation. From week 20, visits/phone contacts will take place every fourth week for the remaining maintenance period un til end of tr eatment (week 68). A follow-up visit (‚Äòend of trial‚Äô) for safety assessments is scheduled 7 weeks after end of treatment to account for the exposure to the long half-life of semaglutide. 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

Using population pharmacokinetic modelling, it was estimated that a once-weekly maintenance dose of 2.4 mg semaglutide will result in similar C maxat steady-state as that obtained by the once-daily 0.4 mg semaglutide dose in trial NN9536- 4153. A maintenance dose of 2.4 mg semaglutide once-weekly has been chosen for the phase 3 weight management development programme. The once-weekly dosing is anticipated to ease the burden of drug administration in clinical practice. Subjects will be initiated at a once-weekly dose of 0.25 mg and follow a fixed-dose escalation regimen, with dose increases every 4 weeks (to doses of 0.5, 1.0, 1.7 and 2.4 mg/week), until the target dose is reached after 16 weeks. A treatment arm with semaglutide 1.0 mg once-weekly is included to be able to compare with the semaglutide s.c. T2D development programme (NN9535) and enables a comparison of the effect on body weight between the two semaglutide doses (1.0 and 2.4 mg) in subjects with overweight or obesity and T2D. It is well known that to mitigate GI side effect s with GLP-1 RA treatment, dose escalation to the target dose is required. Based on experience from the semaglutide T2D development programme, a similar fixed-dose escalation regimen was selected, with dose escalation every 4 weeks until the target dose of 2.4 mg is reached after 16 weeks. Please refer to Section 7.1for more details on treatment doses. 6 Trial population Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrolment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted. 6.1 Inclusion criteria Subjects are eligible to be included in the trial only if all of the following criteria apply: 1.

However, all effort should be made to have the subject attend at least the ‚Äòend of treatment‚Äô clinic visit containing the final data collection of primary and confirmatory secondary efficacy endpoints, and the ‚Äòend of trial‚Äô visit. If the subject refuses to attend the ‚Äòend of treatment‚Äô and/or ‚Äòend of trial‚Äô visit, information about the attempts to follow up with the subject must be documented in the subject‚Äôs medical record. The subject must be discontinued from tria l product, if any of the following applies: 1. Included in the trial in violation of the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria and/or randomisation criteria 2. Safety concern as judged by the investigator3. Calcitonin F 100 ng/L ( Appendix 9 ) 4. Suspicion of pancreatitis 5. Pregnancy6. Intention of becoming pregnant7. Simultaneous participation in another clinical trial of an approved or non-approved investigational medicinal product. If acute pancreatitis is suspected appropriate actions should be initiated, including local measurement of amylase and lipase (see Appendix 4 for reporting). Subjects meeting discontinuation of trial product criterion no. 4 are allowed to resume trial product if the Atlanta criteria70are not fulfilled and thus, the suspicion of acute pancreatitis is not confirmed. Trial product may be resumed for subjects w ith a gallstone-induced pancreatitis in case of cholecystectomy. Subjects meeting discontinuation of trial product criteria no. 2, 5 and 6 are allowed to resume trial product, if the criteria are no longer met (Section 8.1.1 ). A subject who does not fulfil the eligibility criteria must not be randomised. If a subject is randomised in violation of inclusion, exclusion or rando misation criteria, this will be handled as an important protocol deviation, and the IEC/IRB and regulatory authorities must be notified according to local requirements. The primary reason for discontinuation of trial product must be specified in the source data at the time of discontinuation, and subject should continue to follow the visit and assessment schedule.

If subject is not allowed to resume trial product, then the reason for discontinuation will be recorded in the ‚Äòend of treatment‚Äô form in the CRF, and final drug accountability must be performed. 8.1.1 Temporary discontinuation of trial treatment If a subject has discontinued trial product due to temporary safety concern not related to trial product and is allowed to resume, the subject s hould follow the guide for missed doses (Section 7.1). Similarly, a subject w ho discontinues trial product on their own initiative should be encouraged to resume the trial product (Section 7.1). Each missed dose should be recorded in the CRF, as per subject‚Äôs reco llection. If a ‚Äòtreatment status‚Äô session previously has been made in IWRS to indicate discontinuation o f trial produc t, a new ‚Äòtreatment status‚Äô session must be made to resume trial product. 8.1.2 Rescue criteria Subjects with persistent and unacceptable hyperglycaemia should be offered rescue medication. If any of the FPG values (including protocol scheduled fasting self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG)) exceed 15 mmol/L (270 mg/dL) and no intercurrent cause of the hyperglycaemia can be identified, a confirmatory FPG (at central laboratory) should be obtained by calling the subject for a re-test. If the confirmatory measurement also exceeds 15 mmol/L (270 mg/dL) the subject must be offered rescue medication, at the discretion of the investigator, according to the ADA/EASD guidelines 69(excluding GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors and amylin analogues). For a description of rescue med ication, please refer to Section 7.7.1 . 8.2 Withdrawal from the trial A subject may withdraw consent at any time at his/her own request. If a subject withdraws consent, the investigator must ask the subject if he/she is willing, as soon as possible, to have assessment performed according to the ‚Äòend of treatment‚Äô visit. See the flowchart for data to be collected. Final drug accountability must be performed even if the subject is not able to come to the trial site. The investigator must make a ‚Äòtreatment status‚Äô session in IWRS to discontinue trial product. If a subject withdraws from the trial, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document this in the medical record. If the subject withdraws consent, Novo Nordisk may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent. 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

It should be measured on a digital scale and recorded in kilograms or pounds (one decimal) using the same scale throughout the trial. The scale must be calibrated yearly as a minimum. !Height is measured without shoes in centimetres or inches (one decimal). BMI will be calculated by the CRF from screening data and must be in agreement with inclusion criterion no. 3. !Waist circumference is defined as the abdominal circumference located midway between the lower rib margin and the iliac crest. Measures must be obtained in standing position with a non-stretchable measuring tape and to the nearest cm or inch. The tape should touch the skin but not compress soft tissue and twists in the tape should be avoided. The subject should be asked to breathe normally. The same measuring tape should be used throughout the trial. The measuring tape will be provided by Novo Nordisk to ensure standardisation. 9.1.2 Clinical outcome assessments Subjects should be given the opportunity to complete the questionnaires by themselves without interruption. Each of the questionnaires takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. The following patient reported outcome questionnaires will be used: !Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite for Clinical Trials (IWQoL-Lite for CT) version 3.0 oThe IWQoL-Lite for CT is a 20-item modified version of a questionnaire tool designed to assess the weight-related quality of life 71. !Patient Global Impression of Status (PGI-S) (IWQoL-Lite for CT) for physical function version 1.0 !Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C) (IWQoL-Lite for CT) for physical function version 1.0 !Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire ‚Äì Speci fic Health Problem (WPAI-SHP) version 2.0 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

The 6MWT assesses the distance a subject can walk in 6 minutes. It is a direct and timed measure of walking ability, which is technically simple, reproducible, and when administrators are well trained, readily standardised. The goal is for the subject to walk as far as possible in six minutes without running. The subject is allowed to self-pace and rest as needed as they traverse back and forth along a marked walkway of 66 feet (20 m) ( Figure 9-1 ). The primary outcome is the distance covered over 6 minutes73, 74. Specifically, all investigators and 6MWT clinical site administrators will receive a manual, providing details for administration of the 6MWT. In addition to the manual, each 6MWT clinical site administrator will have a checklist that must be completed prior to initiating each test administration to confirm and document that specific test administration criteria are met (e.g., the test is assessed along a flat, straight, undisturbed room that is at least 6 feet (1.8 m) wide; proper footwear as judged by the investigator is worn by the subject or otherwise noted) 75.

The subjects will be instructed in how to use the device. Investigator should ensure throughout the trial that the subject is able to correctly measure BG at any time. The BG meters use test strips calibrated to pl asma values. Therefore, all measurements performed with capillary blood are automatically calibrated to plasma equivalent glucose values, which will be shown on the display. The BG meter provided by Novo Nordisk should be used for the measurements required in the protocol. SMPG measurements should be taken fasting (at least 8 hours overnight before the visit) and prior to taking any diabetes medication. SMPG should be taken either on the day of the clinic visit or on the day before, according to the flowchart. In case of suspicion of a hypoglycaemic event a SMPG should also be taken. Subjects should be instructed in how to record the results of the SMPG values in the diaries. The record of each SMPG value should include date, time and value. All data from the diary must be transcribed into the CRF during or following the contact. If obtained via phone and a discrepancy is later detected, the values in the CRF must be corrected. Occasional review by the investigator of the BG meter values stored in the memory of the BG meter and correct reporting of these in the diary is advised in order to ensure adequacy of the data reported in the CRF. 9.1.4 Clinical efficacy laboratory assessments All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2 , must be conducted in accordance with the flowchart and the laboratory manual. 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

These events are reviewed by an independent external event adjudication committee in a blinded manner, refer to Appendix 3 for further details. There are four ways to identify events relevant for adjudication as described below: !Investigator-reported events for adjudication: When reporting AEs, the investigator must select the appropriate AE category based on pre-defined criteria ( Table 9-1 and Appendix 4 ) !Death !AE Search (standardised screening): All AEs not directly reported by the investigator as requiring adjudication, will undergo screening to identify potential events for adjudication. The investigator can be queried to provide addi tional information related to the reported AE, e.g. alternative aetiology, underlying cause(s) and/or clinical details. !EAC-identified events: When reviewing source documents provided for another event for adjudication, the EAC can identify additional events in scope for adjudication that were not initially reported by the investigator. In these in stances, the investigator will be notified of the newly identified event and has the option to report the EAC-identified event. Regardless of whether the investigator decides to report the event, it will undergo adjudication. Occasionally, EAC-identified events may require the investigator to collect additional source documents, which should be provided by uploading to the event adjudication system(EAS). With the exception of EAC-identified events, an event-specific adjudication form for the event in question should be completed in the CRF within 14 calendar days of the investigator‚Äôs first knowledge of the event. 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

If no, or insufficient source documents are provided to the adjudication supplier, the investigator can be asked to complete a clinical narrative to be uploaded to the EAS. If new information becomes available for an event sent for adjudication, it is the re sponsibility of the investigator to ensure the new information is uploaded to the EAS. 9.2.2 Method of detecting AEs and SAEs Care should be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and non- leading verbal questioning of the subject is the preferred method to inquire about events. 9.2.3 Follow-up on AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each subject at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or if the event is otherwise explained (e.g. chronic condition) or the subject is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 8.3). Further information on follow-up procedures is given in Appendix 4 . 9.2.4 Regulatory reporting requirements for SAEs Prompt notification by the investigator to Novo Nordisk of a SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of subjects and the safety of a trial product under clinical investigation are met. Novo Nordisk has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a trial product under clinical investigation. Novo Nordisk will comply with country-specific regulatory re quirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/ IEC, and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for SUSARs according to local regulatory requirements and Novo Nordisk policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific safety information (e.g. summary or listing of SAEs), from Novo Nordisk will review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 9.2.5 Cardiovascular and death events Cardiovascular and death events will be handled and reported according to AE/SAEs description in Section 9.2.1 . 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

A concomitant illness is any illness that is present at the start of the trial (i.e. at the first visit) or found as a result of a screening procedure or other trial procedures performed before exposure to trial product. Medical history is a medical event that the subject has experienced in the past. Only relevant and significant medical history as judged by the i nvestigator should be recorded. Findings of specific medical history should de described in designated forms. As part of the medical history information related to history of gallbladder disease, breast neoplasm, colon neoplasm, skin cancer, and psychiatric disorder will be recorded. Follow-up questions will be asked at the end of trial related to the breast neoplasm and colon neoplasm. In case of an abnormal and clinically significant finding, the investigator must record the finding on the Medical History/Concomitant Illness form if it is present at screening. Any new finding fulfilling the AE definition ( Appendix 4 ) during the trial and any clinically significant worsening from baseline must be reported as an AE (Section 9.2). 9.4.1 Mental health assessment instruments !PHQ-976is a 9-item depression module of the patient health questionnaire, which is a self - administered diagnostic tool used for assessment of mental disorders.

Results of an eye examination performed by an ophthalmologist, or equally qualified certified health care provider (e.g. optometrist) must be available and evaluated by the investigator before randomisation to assess eligibility. The eye examination should be performed as a fundus photography (e.g. 2-field 60 degree or better, co lour or red-free) or by slit-lamp bio microscopy examination (e.g. using a pre-corneal or corneal contact lens examination) and performed with pharmacologically dilated pupils. If the subject had such an eye examination performed within 90 days prior to screening, the investigator may base their evaluation upon the results of that examination. The examination must be repeated before randomisation if the subject has experienced worsening of visual function since the last examination. If the applicable eye examination was performed before the subject signed the informed consent form, it must be documented that the reason for performing the examination was not related to this trial. After randomisation an eye examination performed according to above must be performed as per the flowchart in Section 2. The investigator should indicate the outcome of each eye examination. Relevant findings prior to randomisation must be recorded as concomitant illness/medical history. While relevant findings occurring after randomisation should be reported as an AE, if applicable according to Section 9.2. 9.4.6 Clinical safety laboratory assessments All protocol-required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2 , must be conducted in accordance with the flowchart and the laboratory manual. !If the laboratory finding based on the results from central laboratory meets the criteria for laboratory outliers, a laboratory outlier form in the CRF should be completed. Please refer to Appendix 2 for the criteria for the laboratory outliers. !Urine pregnancy tests provided by central laboratory must be performed for women of childbearing potential at screening and as specified in the flowchart. Urine pregnancy test must be repeated at any time during the trial if pregnancy is suspected. Further instructions can be found in the laboratory manual. !Urinalysis: Proteinuria should be assessed using a spot urine collection to measure urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). The spot urine specimen should be collected on first morning samples. Persistent proteinuria is define d as having 2 out of 3 consecutive samples above the limit for macroalbuminuria or microalbunuria. Repeat UACR should be done for at least 4 weeks apart after positive UACR ( F 30 mg/g) to confirm the finding. 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

In these cases, it is also recommended to test for tryptase (total and/or mature tryptase) within 3 hours of the hypersensitivity reaction. In case a tryptase sample was collected within 3 hours of the event of hypersensitivity reaction, a baseline tryptase sample should be taken at the same time as the IgE sample is obtained (after 1-2 weeks of drug wash-out). Tryptase concentrations (if measured) as well as results of anti-semaglutide antibody and IgE isotype anti-semaglutide antibodies will be collected by Novo Nordisk and the results will be reported in the CTR. 10 Statistical considerations Taxonomy of week 68 assessments For each subject a given assessment at week 68 may be available or missing and Table 10-1 describes the taxonomy for this.

However, no formal statist ical inference is planned based on number of adverse events. Given the trial sample size, the power of statistical tests for effect endpoints is described below. The tests of superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg to semaglutide placebo I/II (or semaglutide 1.0 mg) for the primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints are performed using the fixed-sequence statist ical str ategy. This strategy tests the endpoints using a predefined hierarchical order, all at the significance level of 5%, moving to test the next endpoint only after a statistically significant superiority result (p-value < 5%) on the previous endpoint. The test hierarchy is given in Table 10-2 with underlying assumptions, marginal power and effective power. The effective power is calculated under the assumption of independence of endpoints by multiplying the respective marginal powers successively. As the two primary endpoints are included in the statistical testing hierarchy, significant superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg versus semaglutide placebo I/II must be demonstrated for each of the primary endpoints. In the analysis approach addressing the primary estimand, week 68 assessments from retrieved subjects (AD) are used. These data are also used to impute missing measurements at week 68 for non-retrieved subjects (MD). The imputation is done separately within each treatment arm (see description below). However, for the power calculations missing values (MT and MD), regardless of treatment arm, are assumed to be similar to semaglutide placebo I/II subjects. These assumptions are likely conservative with respect to the power, and correspond to the jump to reference sensitivity analysis planned below. Assumptions The common assumptions for the power calculations are 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

All tests except no. 6 are testing for superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg to semaglutide placebo I/II. Test no. 6 is a test for superiority of semaglutide 2.4 mg to semaglutide 1.0 mg for the primary endpoint change in body weight (%). Given these assumptions, the sample size of 1200 subjects (400 in each arm), gives an effective power (marginal powers multiplied) of 94% for the first nine endpoints in the hierarchical testing procedure. As sample size is primarily driven by safety , additional scenarios for assumptions are not included due to the overall high power. 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

An illustration of all imputation approaches for the effectiveness estimand is given in Figure 10-1 . Primary imputation approach for the primary estimand Multiple imputation approach using retrieved subjects (RD-MI): The primary imputation approach for the primary estimand is a multiple imputation similar to the one described by McEvoy78. Missing body weight measurement at week 68 for non-retrieved subjects (MD) are imputed using assessments from retrieved subjects (AD) in each randomised treatment arm. This will be done according to the timing of last available observati on (LAO) of body weight. Missing body weight measurements at week 68 for subjects on randomised treatment (MT) are imputed by sampling from available measurements at week 68 from subjects on randomised treatment (AT) in the relevant randomised treatment arm. The multiple im putation approach is done in three steps: 1.Imputation : Defines an imputation model using retrieved subjects (AD) from FAS and done within groups defined by randomised treatment and the timing of the LAO of body weight. The model will be a linear regression of body weight (kg) at week 68 with gender (male/female), baseline BMI (kg/m 2) (in categories 27-<35,35-<40, F40) and stratification groups (defined by stratification categories for OAD treatment and HbA1c) as factors and baseline body weight (kg) and LAO of body weight (kg) as covariates. No interactions will be included. The grouping of timing will be done by quarters (intervals of 17 weeks). If timing by quarters is too restrictive, halves (intervals of 34 weeks) or excluding timing will be used. If any subjects are MT, an imputation model for missing body weight measure ments at week 68 for MT subjects will also be defined using AT subjects in a similar way. The estimated posterior distribution for the parameters (regression coefficients and variances) in the imputation models are then used to impute missing week 68 body weight values for each randomised treatment arm. This will be done 1,000 times and results in 1,000 complete data sets. 2.Analysis : Analysis of each of the 1,000 complete data sets, using the analysis models (ANCOVA and logistic regression) results in 1,000 times 2 estimations. 3.Pooling : Integrates the 1,000 times 2 estimation results into two final results using Rubin‚Äôs formula. Based on NN9536-4153 phase 2 results 1,000 copies should be sufficient to establish stable results. If 1,000 copies are insufficient, 10,000 copies will be used. The multiple imputations will be generated using Novo Nordisk trial number 95364374 as seed number. Sensitivity analyses 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

This approach makes the assumption that subjects instantly after discontinuation lose any effect of randomised treatment beyond what can be expected from semaglutide placebo I/II treatment as adjunct to reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity 79. The multiple imputation approach is done as above with the first step replaced by 1.Imputation : Defines an imputation model using semaglutide placebo I/II subjects from FAS with a week 68 measurement (AT and AD). The model will be a linear regression of body weight (kg) at week 68 with gender (male/female), BMI (kg/m2) (in categories 27-<35,35-<40, F40) and stratification groups (defined by stratification categories for OAD treatment and HbA1c) as factors and baseline body weight (kg) as covariate. No interactions will be included. The estimated posterior distribution for the parameter s (regression coefficients and variances) in the imputation models are then used to impute missing week 68 body weight values for each randomised treatment arm. This will be done 1,000 times and results in 1,000 complete data sets. The jump to reference approach is the basis for the sample size calculations. A single imputation approach as done by Sacks 80(S1-SI and S2-SI) : Missing weight measurements at week 68 for non-retrieved subjects (MD) are imputed using a weight regain rate of 0.3 kg/month after LAO but truncated at no change from baseline whenever the extrapolation would lead to a positive weight gain relative to baseline. If a subject's weight at drug discontinuation represented a gain in weight relative to baseline, no additional gain will be imputed, and the unfavourable gain is carried forward to week 68. The weight regain imputation will be done for both randomised arms (S1-SI). Additionally, a version where only the semaglutide 2.4 mg arm uses the regain rate while the semaglutide placebo I/II arm uses last available observation (corresponding to a weight regain rate of 0 kg/month) will be performed (S2-SI). For both versions, missing weight measurements at week 68 for subjects on randomised treatment (MT) are imputed by using LAO. Tipping-point multiple imputation analysis (TP-MI) : First, missing data are imputed according to the primary multiple imputation approach. Second, for the semaglutide 2.4 mg treatment arm a penalty will be added to the imputed values at week 68. The approach is to gradually increase this penalty until all confirmed conclusions from the primary analysis are reversed. For each hypothesis tested the specific value of the penalty that reverses the conclusion will be used to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis results. This sensitivity analysis evaluates the robustness of the superiority conclusions. Mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) : This ‚ÄòMMRM for effectiveness‚Äô will use all assessments regardless of adherence to randomised treatment, including assessments at week 68 for retrieved drop-outs (AD).

For lipids and biomarkers a multiplicative mode l will be used, i.e. the ratio between post randomisation measurements and baseline will be calculated instead of differences, and both the dependent variable and covariate will be log-transformed. Analyses addressing the secondary estimand The supportive secondary endpoints which relate to the primary objective will be analysed to address the secondary estimand using the same MMRM for efficacy described for the primary endpoints. Sensitivity analyses for supportive secondary endpointsFor supportive secondary endpoints no sensitivity analysis will be carried out. Analysis of safety endpoints The safety endpoint pulse will be analysed using an MMRM for efficacy as described in Section 10.3.1 . For amylase, lipase and calcitonin descriptive statistics will be provided. The analysis of calcitonin will be stratified by gender. Adverse events will be defined as ‚Äútreatment-emergent‚Äù (TEAE), if the onset of the event occurs in the on-treatment period (see definition in Section 10.2). TEAEs and SAEs will be summarised by descriptive statistics, such as frequencies and rates. No formal statistical inference will be carried out based on the number of TEAEs and SAEs.

The Semaglutide s.c. safe ty committee may recomme nd unblinding of any data for further analysis, and in this case an independent ad hoc group will be established in order to maintain the blinding of the trial personnel. Event adjudication committee An independent external EAC is established to perform ongoing blinded adjudication of selected types of events and deaths ( Table 9-1 and Appendix 4 ). The EAC will evaluate events sent for adjudication using pre-defined definitions and guidelines in accordance with the EAC Charter. The evaluation is based on review of pre-defined clinical data collected by the trial sites. The EAC is composed of permanent members covering all required medical specialities. EAC members must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and must be independent of Novo Nordisk. The EAC will have no authorisations to impact on trial conduct, trial protocol or amendments. The assessment made by both the EAC and the investigator will be presented in the clinical trial report. In this trial, cardiovascular events will be adjudicated in order to adequately characterize the cardiovascular safety profile, since cardiovascular disease is an important and serious comorbidity of obesity 83. In addition, events of acute pancreatitis will be adjudicated because Novo Nordisk monitors these events closely as treatment with GLP-1 RA has been associated with acute pancreatitis. 7) Publication policy The information obtained during the conduct of this trial is considered confidential, and may be used by or on behalf of Novo Nordisk for regulatory purposes as well as for the general development of the trial product.

In such cases, all subject identifiers, with the exception of the subject number, will be redacted on the copies of the source documents before submission to Novo Nordisk. !For all non-serious AEs the applicable forms should be signed when the event is resolved or at the end of the trial at the latest.

Novo Nordisk may need to report this AE to relevant regulatory authorities. Assessment of severity The investigator will assess intensity for each event reported during the trial and assign it to one of the following categories: !Mild : An event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities. !Moderate : An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday activities. !Severe : An event that prevents normal everyday activities. !Note: Severe is a category used for rating the intensity of an event; and both an AE and SAE can be assessed as severe.

Alternative aetiology, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant medication, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to trial product administration will be considered and investigated. The investigator should use the IB for the assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical records that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report. However, it is important that the investigator always makes an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data . The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up information and send a follow-up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. Final outcome The investigator will select the most appropriate outcome: !Recovered/resolved: The subject has fully recovered, or by medical or surgical treatment the condition has returned to the level observed at the first trial-related activity after the subject signed the informed consent. !Recovering/resolving: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover from the event. This term is only applicable if the subject has completed the trial or has died from another AE. !Recovered/resolved with sequelae: The subject has recovered from the condition, but with lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequelae meets an SAE criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE. !Not recovered/not resolved: The condition of the subject has not improved and the symptoms are unchanged or the outcome is not known. !Fatal: This term is only applicable if the subject died from a condition related to the reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a subject before he/she died should be assessed as ‚Äúrecovered/resolved‚Äù, ‚Äúrecovering/resolving‚Äù, ‚Äúrecovered/resolved with sequelae‚Äù or ‚Äúnot recovered/not resolved‚Äù. An AE with a fatal outcome must be reported as an SAE. !Unknown: This term is only applicable if the subject is lost to follow-up. Follow-up of AE and SAE The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by Novo Nordisk to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible (e.g. severe hypersensitivity reactions). This may include additional laboratory tests (e.g. skin prick test) or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals. If a subject dies during participation in the trial or during a recognised follow-up period, the investigator should provide Novo Nordisk with a copy of autopsy report including histopathology.

Therefore, Novo Nordisk has included hypoglycaemia with PG levels below this cut-off point in the definition of BG confirmed hypoglycaemia. Novo Nordisk uses the following classification ( Figure 11-1 ) in addition to the ADA classification90: 1. Severe hypoglycaemia according to the ADA classification90. 2. Symptomatic BG confirmed hypoglycaemia: An episode that is BG confirmed by PG value < 3.1 mmo l/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia. 3.

When a subject experiences a hypoglycaemic episode, subject should record the general information in relation to the hypoglycaemia (timing, PG measurements, symptoms etc. as described in the diary). In case a subject is not able to fill in the diary (e.g. in case of hospitalisation or at the ‚Äòfollow-up phone contact‚Äô), then investigator should report the hypoglycaemic episode directly in the CRF. Upon onset of a hypoglycaemic episode the subject is recommended to measure PG every 15 minutes until the SMPG value is > 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) and/or symptoms have been resolved in accordance with current guidelines 90. Repeated SMPG measurements and/or symptoms will by default be considered as one hypoglycaemic episode until a succeeding SMPG value is > 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) and/or symptoms have been resolved. One hypoglycaemic episode form is to cover these measurements and/or symptoms. In case of several low SMPG values within the hypoglycaemic episode, the lowest value is the one that will be reported as the SMPG value for the hypoglycaemic episode but the start time of the episode will remain as the time for the first low SMPG value and/or symptom. The investigator must review the diary for low SMPG values not reported as hypoglycaemic episodes. The subject must be questioned whether any of the low values were severe, i.e. whether the subject was able to self-treat or not. If the subject was not able to self-treat, it has to be reported as a severe hypoglycaemic episode. For low SMPG values for hypoglycaemic episodes where the subject was able to self-treat: If a hypoglycaemic episode form is not completed within 7 calendar days of the SMPG measurement, the episode should be reported on a hypoglycaemic episode form with as much information as possible. Novo Nordisk will not query for additional data except for the start date, SMPG value and whether the subject was able to self-treat due to decreased validity of such data 91, 92. The subject must be re-trained in how to report hypoglycaemic episodes if the investigator identifies low SMPG values not reported as hypoglycaemic episodes. 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

The human relevance of this finding is unknown. However, based on the findings in rodents, monitoring of serum calcitonin (a sensitive biomarker for C-cell activation) is currently being performed in clinical trials with semaglutide. While there is general agreement on the clinical interpretation of substantially elevated calcitonin levels (> 100 ng/L) as likely indicative of C-cell neoplasia, the interpretation of values between upper normal range (5.0 and 8.4 ng/L for women and men, respectively) and 100 ng/L is less clear with regards to indication of disease. There are several known confounding factors affecting calcitonin levels, e.g.: !renal dysfunction !tobacco use !autoimmune thyroiditis !several drug classes (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, beta-blockers, H 2-blockers and glucocorticoids) Physiology of C-cell activation in various clinical c onditions and in different patient po pulations (i.e. with various comorbidities) is poorly understood. There may be various clinical conditions not identified so far which mildly or moderately affect calcitonin secretion by C-cells. Calcitonin monitoring A blood sample will be drawn at pre-specified trial visits for measurement of calcitonin. In case a subject has a calcitonin value F 10 ng/L, the algorithm outlined in Figure 11-3 and described below should be followed.

If the subject is a screen failure, or if the value is from the last sample taken in the trial, the subject should be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation. Background: Calcitonin values from 20-50 ng/L were found in up to 1% of subjects of the population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease93. The predictive value of a C-cell anomaly for this calcitonin level was 8.3%. However, the likelihood of having a medullary carcinoma >1 cm with calcitonin in this range is extremely low.

One patient out of the 216 had a subsequent basal (unstimulated) calcitonin value of 33 ng/L, and had C- cell hyperplasia at surgery. Two other studies used a cut-off of calcitonin > 10 ng/L to screen for C- cell disease, but they do not provide sufficient information on patients with basal CT > 10 and < 20 ng/L to allow conclusions94, 95. 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

The rationale for implementation is to ensure a better characterisation of the population in scope as new technologies and hypothesis develops. The collection of whole blood at baseline (visit 2) and end of treatment (visit 24) will allow for future genetic analysis thereby increasing the understanding of obesity, obesity treatment and -related diseases in the future. !As the scope of the biosampling for future analysis has broadened to cover obesity and -related diseases with this amendment, some paragraphs in appendix 7 has been revised. Furthermore, the informed consent has been updated to reflect the broader scope. A separate protocol will be developed before the biosamples from trial NN9536-4374 can be analysed in the future. This will include rationale for the analysis as well as reporting requirements. !Removal of criteria for discontinuation of trial tr eatment for subjects included in the trial in violation of the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria and/or randomisation criteria. Subjects will not be discontinued from trial product if considered safe to continue. However, prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrolment criteria, also known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted and de viations from the protocol should be avoided. !Removal of the persistent criteria from the exploratory endpoint in section 4.2.3 and update of section 9.4.6 accordingly, since the exploratory endpoint about onset of micro or macro albuminuria as well as regression to normoalbuminuria could not be adequately assessed with the definition of persistent and current trial design. This is due to the fact that the final assessment at week 68 should be confirmed with 2 confirmatory assessments after end of treatment. !Classifications of risks have been removed from the protocol and instead a reference to the IB or any updates hereof has been added for further details of the risks associated with semaglutide treatment. !Minor clarification of content and correction of minor errors and typos.

Clinical59-63 ,65and non-clinical data6566indicate that the body weight-reducing effect of semaglutide is mainly mediated by a reduced energy intake. No unexpected safety findings were identified and the tolerability and safety profile was overall consistent with previous findings in the T2D development programme and the GLP-1 RA class in general. 2.3 Section 3.3 Benefit-risk assessment2.3.1 3.3.2 Risks and precautions The sections below describe identified and potential risks associated with semaglutide treatment. For classification and further details of the risks, please refer to the current version of the IB or any updates hereof. The identified/potential risks are based on findings in non-clinical studies and clinical trials with semaglutide as well as other GLP-1 RAs. For each of these risks, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial. Identified risks !Gastrointestinal adverse events Consistent with findings with other GLP-1 RAs, the most frequently reported adverse events (AE) in clinical trials with semaglutide were gastrointestinal AEs. A low starting dose and dose escalation steps will be implemented in the trial to mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs . Potential risks !Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) (based on non-clinical data) Expected proliferative thyroid C-cell changes were seen in the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies after daily exposure to semaglutide for 2 years. No hyperplasia was observed in monkeys after 52 weeks exposure up to 13-fold above the clinical plasma exposure at 2.4 mg/week. In clinical trials with semaglutide, there have been no reports of MTC or clinically relevant changes in calcitonin levels. The C-cell changes in rodents are mediated by the GLP-1 receptor, which is not expressed in the normal human thyroid. Accordingly, the risk of GLP-1 receptor-mediated C- cell changes in humans is considered to be low. However, as a precaution, exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to medical history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) or MTC and elevated plasma levels of calcitonin (biomarker for MTC) have been implemented in the trial. Other risks !Pregnancy and fertility (based on non-clinical data) 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

There are limited data from the use of semaglutide in pregnant women. Therefore, semaglutide should not be used during pregnancy. Exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to pregnancy have been implemented in the trial. 2.4 Section 4.2 Primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints 2.4.1 Section 4.2.3 Exploratory endpoints The exploratory endpoints reflect the comparison of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once-weekly versus semaglutide placebo I/II.

The rationale for implementation is to ensure a better characterisation of the population in scope as new technologies and hypothesis develops. The collection of whole blood at baseline (visit 2) and end of treatment (visit 24) will allow for future genetic analysis thereby increasing the understanding of obesity, obesity treatment and -related diseases in the future. !As the scope of the biosampling for future analysis has broadened to cover obesity and -related diseases with this amendment, some paragraphs in appendix 7 has been revised. Furthermore, the informed consent has been updated to reflect the broader scope. A separate protocol will be developed before the biosamples from trial NN9536-4374 can be analysed in the future. This will include rationale for the analysis as well as reporting requirements. !Removal of the persistent criteria from the exploratory endpoint in section 4.2.3 and update of section 9.4.6 accordingly, since the exploratory endpoint about onset of micro or macro albuminuria as well as regression to normoalbuminuria could not be adequately assessed with the definition of persistent and current trial design. This is due to the fact that the final assessment at week 68 should be confirmed with 2 confirmatory assessments after end of treatment. !Classifications of risks have been removed from the protocol and instead a reference to the IB or any updates hereof has been added for further details of the risks associated with semaglutide treatment. !Minor clarification of content and correction of minor errors and typos.

No unexpected safety findings were identified and the tolerability and safety profile was overall consistent with previous findings in the T2D development programme and the GLP-1 RA class in general. 2.3 Section 3.3 Benefit-risk assessment2.3.1 3.3.2 Risks and precautions The sections below describe identified and potential risks associated with semaglutide treatment. For classification and further details of the risks, please refer to the current version of the IB or any updates hereof. The identified/potential risks are based on findings in non-clinical studies and clinical trials with semaglutide as well as other GLP-1 RAs. For each of these risks, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the ri sks for subjects enrolled in this trial. Identified risks !Gastrointestinal adverse events Consistent with findings with other GLP-1 RAs, the most frequently reported adverse events (AE) in clinical trials with semaglutide were gastrointestinal AEs. A low starting dose and dose escalation steps will be implemented in the trial to mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs . Potential risks !Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) (based on non-clinical data) Expected proliferative thyroid C-cell changes were seen in the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies after daily exposure to semaglutide for 2 years. No hyperplasia was observed in monkeys after 52 weeks exposure up to 13-fold above the clinical plasma exposure at 2.4 mg/week. In clinical trials with semaglutide, there have been no reports of MTC or clinically relevant changes in calcitonin levels. The C-cell changes in rodents are mediated by the GLP-1 receptor, which is not expressed in the normal human thyroid. Accordingl y, the risk of GLP-1 receptor-mediated C-c ell changes in humans is considered to be low. However, as a precaution, exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to medical history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) or MTC and elevated plasma levels of calcitonin (biomarker for MTC) have been implemented in the trial. Other risks !Pregnancy and fertility (based on non-clinical data) Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. There are limited data from the use of semaglutide in pregnant women. Therefore, se maglutide should not be used during pregnancy. Exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to pregnancy have been implemented in the trial. 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

The rationale for implementation is to ensure a better characterisation of the population in scope as new technologies and hypothesis develops. The collection of whole blood at baseline (visit 2) and end of treatment (visit 24) will allow for future genetic analysis thereby increasing the understanding of obesity, obesity treatment and -related diseases in the future. !As the scope of the biosampling for future analysis has broadened to cover obesity and -related diseases with this amendment, some paragraphs in appendix 7 has been revised. Furthermore, the informed consent has been updated to reflect the broader scope. A separate protocol will be developed before the biosamples from trial NN9536-4374 can be analysed in the future. This will include rationale for the analysis as well as reporting requirements. !Removal of the persistent criteria from the exploratory endpoint in section 4.2.3 and update of section 9.4.6 accordingly, since the exploratory endpoint about onset of micro or macro albuminuria as well as regression to normoalbuminuria could not be adequately assessed with the definition of persistent and current trial design. This is due to the fact that the final assessment at week 68 should be confirmed with 2 confirmatory assessments after end of treatment. !Classifications of risks have been removed from the protocol and instead a reference to the IB or any updates hereof has been added for further details of the risks associated with semaglutide treatment. !Minor clarification of content and correction of minor errors and typos.

No unexpected safety findings were identified and the tolerability and safety profile was overall consistent with previous findings in the T2D development programme and the GLP-1 RA class in general. 2.3 Section 3.3 Benefit-risk assessment2.3.1 3.3.2 Risks and precautions The sections below describe identified and potential risks associated with semaglutide treatment. For classification and further details of the risks, please refer to the current version of the IB or any updates hereof. The identified/potential risks are based on findings in non-clinical studies and clinical trials with semaglutide as well as other GLP-1 RAs. For each of these risks, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the ri sks for subjects enrolled in this trial. Identified risks !Gastrointestinal adverse events Consistent with findings with other GLP-1 RAs, the most frequently reported adverse events (AE) in clinical trials with semaglutide were gastrointestinal AEs. A low starting dose and dose escalation steps will be implemented in the trial to mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs . Potential risks !Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) (based on non-clinical data) Expected proliferative thyroid C-cell changes were seen in the mouse and rat carcinogenicity studies after daily exposure to semaglutide for 2 years. No hyperplasia was observed in monkeys after 52 weeks exposure up to 13-fold above the clinical plasma exposure at 2.4 mg/week. In clinical trials with semaglutide, there have been no reports of MTC or clinically relevant changes in calcitonin levels. The C-cell changes in rodents are mediated by the GLP-1 receptor, which is not expressed in the normal human thyroid. Accordingl y, the risk of GLP-1 receptor-mediated C-c ell changes in humans is considered to be low. However, as a precaution, exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to medical history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) or MTC and elevated plasma levels of calcitonin (biomarker for MTC) have been implemented in the trial. Other risks !Pregnancy and fertility (based on non-clinical data) Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. There are limited data from the use of semaglutide in pregnant women. Therefore, se maglutide should not be used during pregnancy. Exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to pregnancy have been implemented in the trial. 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

Treatment with oral agents should be stable (same drug(s), dose and dosing frequency) for at least 90 days prior to screening. 2.6 Section 7.1 Treatments administered !If a subject does not tolerate the designated recommended target dose of ( 1.0 or 2.4 mg once weekly), the subject may stay at a lower dose level of 1.7 mg once weekly. This should only be allowed if the subject would otherwise discontinue trial product completely and if considered safe to continue on trial product, as per the i nvestigator‚Äôs discretion. It is recommended that the subject makes at least one attempt to re-escalate to the designated recommended target dose,of 2.4 mg once-weekly as per the investigator‚Äôs discretion. Both pens should be used during down- and re-escalation. Table 7-2: Dose escalation and maintenance in the semaglutide 2.4 mg once-weekly/semaglutide II placebo arms.

Results of an eye examination performed by an ophthalmologist or equally qualified certified health care provider (e.g. optometrist) must be available and evaluated by the investigator before randomisation to assess eligibility. The eye examination should be performed as a fundus photography (e.g. 2-field 60 degree or better, colour or red-free) or by slit-lamp biomicroscopy examination (e.g. using a pre-corneal or corneal contact lens examination) and performed with pharmacologically dilated pupils. If the subject had such an eye examination performed within 90 days prior to screening ,the investigator may base his/her their evaluation upon the results of that examination. The examination must be repeated before randomisation if the subject has experienced worsening of visual function since the last examination. If the applicable eye examination was performed before the subject signed the informed consent form, it must be documented that the reason for performing the examination was not related to this trial. 2.7.2 Section 9.4.6 Clinical safety laboratory assessments Urinalysis: Proteinuria should be assessed using a spot urine collection to measure urine albumin- to-creatinine ratio (UACR). The spot urine specimen should be collected on first morning samples. Persistent proteinuria is defined as having 2 out of 3 consecutive samples above the limit for macroalbuminuria or microalbunuria. Repeat UACR should be done for at least 4 weeks apart after positive UACR ( B 30 mg/g) to confirm the finding. 2.8 Section 9.7 Genetics Not applicable for this trial. A blood sample for genetic analysis will be collected from patients who have consented to participate in the optional biobank component of the trial.

Participation in the biobank component is optional. Patients who do not wish to participate in the biobank component may still participate in the trial. For the biobank, samples will be collected according to the flowchart and stored for future use. The samples are collected for the purpose of allowing future analyses of biomarkers, both genetic and circulating, at a later point in time when new knowledge or improved measurement techniques may have become available. The analyses may include biomarkers currently known or discovered in the future. Genetic analyses may include analysis of candidate genes or genetic markers throughout the genome with the purpose of understanding and predicting response to semaglutide as well as to understand obesity or other related diseases. Analyses of circulating biomarkers will measure hormones, metabolites or other non-genetic serum entity with the purpose of understanding and predicting response to semaglutide as well as understanding obesity or other related diseases. These samples need to be frozen and should be sent in batches to the central laboratory. The analyses are likely to be performed after the trial has come to an end, and results will therefore not be part of the clinical trial report.

Other risks !Pregnancy and fertility (based on non-clinical data) Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. There are limited data from the use of semaglutide in pregnant women. Therefore, semaglutide should not be used during pregnancy. Exclusion and discontinuation criteria related to pregnancy have been implemented in the trial. 2.4 Section 4.2 Primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints 2.4.1 Section 4.2.3 Exploratory endpoints The exploratory endpoints reflect the comparison of semaglutide s.c. 2.4 mg once-weekly versus semaglutide placebo I/II. Subjects who after 68 weeks achieve (yes/no) the following in: !New onset of persistent micro albuminuria (UACR C 30 and D 300 mg/g) in subjects without albuminuria (UACR < 30 mg/g) at randomisation (week 0) !New onset of persistent macro albuminuria (UACR > 300 mg/g) in subjects without macro albuminuria at randomisation (week 0) !Regression of micro albuminuria/macro albuminuria to normal (in subjects with either micro (UACR C 30 and D 300 mg/g ) or macro albuminuria (UACR > 300 mg/g ) at baseline (week 0)) 2.5 Section 6.1 Inclusion criteria 6. Subject treated with either: !diet and exercise alone or stable treatment with metformin, SU, SGLT2i, glitazone as single agent therapy or !up to 3 OADs (metformin, SU, SGLT2i or glitazone) according to local label Any approved and marketed metformin, glitazone, SGLT2i or SU product or combination products are allowed. Treatment with oral agents should be stable (same drug(s), dose and dosing frequency) for at least 90 days prior to screening. 2.6 Section 7.1 Treatments administered !If a subject does not tolerate the designated recommended target dose of ( 1.0 or 2.4 mg once weekly), the subject may stay at a lower dose level of 1.7 mg once weekly. This should only be allowed if the subject would otherwise discontinue trial product completely and if considered safe to continue on trial product, as per the i nvestigator‚Äôs discretion.

The placebo II arm will follow the escalation regimen outlined in Table 7-3. !Injections may be administered in the thigh, abdomen or upper arm, at any time of day irrespective of meals. Subjects should be encouraged to inject in the same area throughout the trial, but changing between left and right side is allowed. 2.7 Section 8 Discontinuation/Withdrawal criteria 2.7.1 Section 8.1 Discontinuation of trial treatment The subject must be discontinued from trial product, if any of the following applies: 1. Included in the trial in violation of the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria and/or randomisation criteria 21. Safety concern as judged by the investigator 3.2. Calcitonin C 100 ng/L (see Appendix 9) 43. Suspicion of pancreatitis 5.4. Pregnancy 6.5. Intention of becoming pregnant 7.6. Simultaneous participation in another clinical trial of an approved or non-approved Investigational medicinal product. Subjects meeting discontinuation of trial product criterion no. 4 3are allowed to resume trial product if the Atlanta criteria70are not fulfilled and thus the suspicion of acute pancreatitis is not confirmed. Trial product may be resumed for subjects w ith a gallstone-induced pancreatitis in case of cholecystectomy. Subjects meeting discontinuation of trial product criteria no. 2 1, 54and 6 5are allowed to resume trial product, if the criteria are no longer met (see Section 8.1.1). 2.8 Section 9.4 Safety assessment 2.8.1 Section 9.4.5 Eye examination Subjects with uncontrolled and potentially unstable diabetic retinopathy or maculopathy are not eligible as this indicates retinopathy that has recen tly progressed to a level that requires intervention or is approaching intervention, but has yet to be brought under control. Results of an eye examination performed by an ophthalmologist, or equally qualified certified health care provider (e.g. optometrist) or another suitably qualified health care provider must be 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"

The eye examination should be performed as a fundus photography (e.g. 2-field 60 degree or better, colour or red-free) or by slit-lamp bio microscopy examination (e.g. using a pre-corneal or corneal contact lens examination) and performed with pharmacologically dilated pupils. If the subject had such an eye examination performed within 90 days prior to screening ,the investigator may base his/her their evaluation upon the results of that examination. The examination must be repeated before randomisation if the subject has experienced worsening of visual function since the last examination. If the applicable eye examination was performed before the subject signed the informed consent form, it must be documented that the reason for performing the examination was not related to this trial. 2.8.2 Section 9.4.6 Clinical safety laboratory assessments Urinalysis: Proteinuria should be assessed using a spot urine collection to measure urine albumin- to-creatinine ratio (UACR). The spot urine specimen should be collected on first morning samples. Persistent proteinuria is defined as having 2 out of 3 consecutive samples above the limit for macroalbuminuria or microalbunuria. Repeat UACR should be done for at least 4 weeks apart after positive UACR ( C 30 mg/g) to confirm the finding. 2.9 Section 9.7 Genetics Not applicable for this trial. A blood sample for genetic analysis will be collected from patients who have consented to participate in the optional biobank component of the trial. Refer to section 9.8 and Appendix 7 for further details. 2.10 Section 9.8 Biomarkers and biosamples for future analysis Collection of samples for biomarker research is part of this trial to support the efficacy objectives. The following samples must be collected in accordance with the laboratory manual and the flowchart: Biomarkers linked to cardiovascular risk: !Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) Activity will be analysed by activity assay. !High sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) Collection of biosamples for future analysis (stored in a biobank) is a component of this trial.

The analyses may include biomarkers currently known or discovered in the future. Genetic analyses may include analysis of candidate genes or genetic markers throughout the genome with the purpose of understanding and predicting response to semaglutide as well as to understand obesity or other related diseases. Analyses of circulating biomarkers will measure hormones, metabolites or other non-genetic serum entity with the purpose of understanding and predicting response to semaglutide as well as understanding obesity or other related diseases. These samples need to be frozen and should be sent in batches to the central laboratory. The analyses are likely to be performed after the trial has come to an end, and results will therefore not be part of the clinical trial report. The biobank samples may be stored up to 15 years after end of trial at a central laboratory (see Appendix 7). 2.11 Section 10.1 Sample size determination 2.11.1 Table 10-2 Assumptions, marginal power and effective power for each endpoint in the hierarchical testing procedure given an anticipated number 1200 randomised subjects (400 in each arm) Foot note: SD = standard deviation; WC = waist circumference; sBP = systolic blood pressure; SF- 36 = Short Form 36 v2.0 acute; PF = physical functioning; IWQoL-Lite = Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite for Clinical Trials; PFD = physical function domain; # shown as a positive number; * semaglutide 2.4 mg vs semaglutide 1.0 mg All tests in the hierarchy are based on the primary estimand. 2.12 Section 10.3 Statistical analyses 2.12.1 Section 10.3.2.1 Confirmatory secondary endpoints 2.12.1.1 Table 10-3 Analysis and imputation methods to address the effectiveness and efficacy estimands for the primary and confirmatory secondary endpoints in the statistical testing hierarchy Foot note: FAS = full analysis set; ANCOVA = analysis of covariance; RD-MI = multiple imputation using retrieved subjects; J2R-MI = jump to reference multiple imputation; S1-SI and S2- SI = single imputation as done by Sacks; TP-MI = tipping point multiple imputation; MMRM = mixed model for repeated measurements; LR = logistic regression; WC = waist circumference; HbA1c = Hemoglobin A1c; sBP = systolic blood pressure; SF-36 = Short Form 36 v2.0 acute; PF = 1.0 .CONFIDENTIAL"
