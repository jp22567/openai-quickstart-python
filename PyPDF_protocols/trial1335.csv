A 7- week , Placebo -Cont rolled, Double -Blinded, Parallel -Group, Imaging Study Using Positron Emission Tomography/Compute d Tomography (PET/CT) to Characterize the Effect of Intravenous Reslizumab on Airway Inflammation in Patients with Eosinophilic Asthma Sponsor: Teva Global Medi cal Affairs Biologic License Application (BLA) Number: 761033 Name of Active Ingredient : Reslizumab (CEP -38072) Name of In vestigational Product : Reslizumab (CEP -38072) Phase of the Study : 4 Number of Investigational Centers Planned: 1 clinical center and 1 radiology center Countries Planned: United States Planned Study Period : Approximately 4th quarter 2016 to 4th quarter 2018 Number of Patients Planned: This study is exploratory in nature; therefore, no fo rmal hypothesis testing is planned. Based on clinical and practical considerations, 5 healthy subjects and 10 eosinophilic asthma patients (5 patients treated with reslizumab, 5 patients treated with placebo) is considered adequate for: • a validation of the ability of positron emission tomography ( PET)/ computed tomography ( CT) to differentiate patients with eosinophilic asthma from healthy controls (HCs) • an evaluation of the effect of reslizumab versus placebo on inflammation of the lungs. Study Population: Males and females, from the ages of 18 t hrough 50 years . Five HCs and 10 patients with asthma and current blood eosinophil levels of at least 400/µL , using ≥440 mcg of fluticasone -equivalent and an allowed 2nd asthma controller (eg, long- acting β -agonist [LABA]) will be recruited. Enrollment will include a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 3 female healthy control subjects and a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 6 f emale patients with eosinophilic asthma. Primary Objective: There are 2 related primary objectives of this study: • To establish that PET/CT imaging of the lung can reliably distinguish healthy, non -asthmatic volunteers and patients with severe asthma with a n eosinophilic phenotype (initial validation). • If the utility of PET /CT scanning is established as per objective 1: to show that reslizumab produces a reduction in signal intensity (reduction in lung inflammation) in patients with severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype. Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives of th is study are: • to demonstrate a correlation between the benefit observed on imaging (PET/CT) with: − reductions blood eosinophil counts − improvement in clinic visit lung function − reducti ons in fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)"

Part 1 is a validation step which will include 2 measures, (1) the intrapatient reproducibility in the global lung glycolysis (GLG) measure, and (2) the signal window representing difference in the measure of GLG for individual patients with sever e asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype and the mean GLG of the healthy controls group. The limit for step 1 above (reproducibility within patients) will be set at ≤1 0% of sequential GLG measures. The limit for step 2 above (the signal window) will be set at ≥5%. These limits have been provided by subject matter experts. Primary Endpoint: The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline to week 4 in GLG (ΔGLG). The supportive primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline to week 4 in lung p arenchyma (LP) standardized uptake value (SUV) mean. Secondary Endpoints: The secondary efficacy endpoints are: • the change from baseline to week 4 in blood eosinophil counts • the change from baseline to week 4 in forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( FEV 1) • the change from baseline to week 4 in FeNO • the change from baseline to week 4 in AQLQ Exploratory Endpoints: The exploratory endpoints of this study are changes in: • biological markers of inflammation and asthma (blood) : − immunoglobulin E (IgE) − dipeptidyl p eptidase 4 (DPP4) − 25-hydroxy vitamin D − eotaxin -1, -2, and -3 − thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC) − monocyte chemoattractant protein -1 (MCP -1) and MCP -4 − group 2 innate lymphoid cell s (ILC2)"

After consent is obtained, all participants will undergo all tests and pr ocedures required for eligibility, including sputum and blood eosinophil level assessments. Patients with asthma (does not apply to HC subjects) must have a screening blood eosinophil count of ≥400 cells/μL to be included. A maximum of 3 blood eosinophil a ssessments will be conducted. If the 1st assessment yields a blood eosinophil level below 400 cells/µL patients with asthma may return for a 2nd assessment of blood eosinophil level after 7 days. A 3rd and final assessment will be performed 7 days after the 2nd assessment, if necessary (eg, if the blood eosinophil level remains <400 cells/μL at the 2nd assessment). The patient must maintain their usual asthma controller regimen without change throughout the screening and study periods. A patient who experiences an asthma exacerbation during this time that requires additional medication, beyond increased short -acting β -agonist (SABA) use, will be considered to have failed screening and cannot undergo randomization. A patient may be rescreened for this reason 1 time only. If a patient experiences an asthma exacerbation requiring treatment with systemic steroids, they will only be allowed to be rescreened 6 weeks after completion of treatment. All patients that have to be rescreened must be stable on other asthma medications for 30 days prior to rescreening. The DEAR study is designe d in 2 parts. Part 1 is a validation of the PET/CT signal as a surrogate of lung inflammation. In this part, the sponsor wishes to determine (1) the intrapatient reproducibility in the GLG measure, and (2) the difference in the GLG measure between individu al patients with severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype (1-by-1) and the entire HC group . Limits for both the reproducibility within patients and difference among the 2 groups have been provided by subject matter experts. Part 2 will be a 7 -week doub le-blind evaluation of patients with severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype that have been randomized to receive a single dose of either placebo or reslizumab at 3 mg/kg. Part 1 Within 7 days (±3 days) of eligibility being confirmed, participants wil l have a PET/CT scan. Participants will return to the 7 days (±3) after the first PET/CT scan (taken during visit 2) for a second PET/CT"

Healthy control subjects (n=5) may also have a second sputum induction and blood sampl e collection a t with 1 day of the 2nd PET/CT scan, if feasible (preferred but not required). Healthy subjects will be considered complete at this time. Only after all 5 HCs have completed the study will patients with asthma be screened . If the relative difference in GLG (based on the average of the 2 measurements) between healthy and asthma patients will be ≥5%, then the ast hma patients will be randomized . A 10% variability (measure d as relative difference between first measurement and second measurement) between PET/CT scans as measured by GLG within each group will be considered as the maximum allowed variability. The part 1 criteria have been set at these levels to observe a difference between the healthy subjects and patients with asthma and to ensure intra -group reproducibility; the criteria are based on the investigators’ prior experience. If these exploratory criteria are not met (eg, 8 or more patients do not meet the criteria to enter Part 2 [inclusion criteria k and l]), then the study will be reevaluated. Part 2 If eligible (eg, if inter - and intra -group GLG variability criteria are met) , patients will be randomized. This may occur at any time after confirmation of eligibility and up to the time of dosing. Patients will return to for baseline clinical, serological, and biochemical measures according to standard procedures. Once these are completed , patients will receive either placebo or reslizumab and will receive the infusion at . Any new ser ious adverse events, reslizumab -related adverse events, and new concomitant medications will be reported. All planned PET/CT scans (weeks 2, 4, and 6) should be scheduled at the time of randomization. Within 2 weeks (±3 days) of the infusion, patients will return to for clinical tests and procedures . Within 3 days of this visit, p atients will undergo a PET/CT scan at the . Patients repeat the clinical tests and procedures at weeks 4 and 6 post -infusion. Each visit at will be followed by a PET/CT scan at the as described above. Method of Randomization and Blinding: After the 2 baseline PET/CT scans and successful completion of all requirements (Part 1), patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 in a double -blind fashion to receive either placebo or intravenous (iv) 3.0 mg/kg resli zumab. In order to maintain the blind, each patient will be assigned a unique identifier number and all reference to the patient will be by using this identifier.

Asthma Asthma is a common, chronic lung disorder chara cterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways. Symptoms of asthma include cough, breathlessness, and wheezing. The most recent estimates suggest that as many as 334 million people in the world have asthma ( Global Asth ma Network 2014). Asthma is a heterogeneous syndrome with distinct phenotypes and variable severity. Certain patients are prone to experiencing asthma exacerbations defined as an acute or sub -acute worsening in symptoms and lung function from the patient’ s usual status ( Global Initiative for Asthma [GINA] 201 5) in patients who are unable to achieve control despite chronic use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and other asthma medications. These patients are considered at high risk because of the morbidity and potential mortality associated with exacerbations. During acute asthma exacerbations, patients often require additional therapy, such as a course of systemic corticosteroids, which have substantial adverse effects ( Walsh et al 2001, Wardlaw et al 2000). Interleukin- 5 (IL -5) is the prototypic maturation and survival factor for eosinophilic granulocytes, which has been strongly implicated in asthma pathogenesis ( Wardlaw et al 2000 ). Eosinophils are major effector cells involved in initiation and propagation of diverse inflammatory responses. A high blood eosinophil count is a risk factor for increased future asthma exacerbations and excessive short -acting beta- agonist (SABA) use after adjustment of potential confounders in adults with persistent asthma, which suggests a higher disease burden in patients with asthma and high blood eosinophil counts ( Tran et al 2014, Zeiger et al 2014). Therapies directed against IL -5 or its receptor (mepolizumab [Nucala ®], reslizumab, and benralizumab) work by reducing eosinophil counts in the circulation and in the airway and have been shown to reduce asthma exacerbations, improve Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ] scores, and/or improve lung function in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in primarily adult populations with asthma and elevated sputum or blood eosinophils ( Castro et al 2011, Haldar et al 2009, Molfino et al 2012, Nair et al 2009, Ortega et al 2014, Pavord et al 2012). 1.1.2. Molecular Imaging in Asthma Molecular imaging has been broadly defined as the use of imaging methods that ‘‘directly or indirectly monitor and record the spatiotemporal distribution of molecular or cellular processes for biochemical, biologic, diagnostic, or therapeutic applications’’ ( Thakur and Lentle 2008). This study proposes the use of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) to investigate the inflammatory response in patients with eosinophilic asthma after anti- IL5 therapy. Molecular imaging with PET/CT requires coupling a positron emitting radioisotope with a short half-life, such as 18F, 11C, or 15O, to a molecule that functions within a know n metabolic"
27,page_27,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protoc ol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 27 pathway. The most commonly used molecule in PET/CT imaging is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG), a radiolabeled glucose analog. When injected intravenously, FDG is transported into metabolically active cells and phosphorylated by the enzyme hexokinase in the same manner as glucose. However, the FDG -6-phosphate is not metabolized further and becomes trapped intracellularly, resulting in an increase in signal from the metabolically active cells. FDG -PET/CT is most commonly used in oncologic imaging because of its ability to depict the increased glucose metabolism present in most malignant neoplasms. However, FDG- PET/CT has also shown promise as an imaging biomarker of lung inflammation. The accumulated evidence suggests that primed and activated neutrophils are the primary (although perhaps not the only) source of increased FDG signal in the lung ( Chen and Schuster 2006). In animal models increased FDG uptake has been demonstrated in acute lung injury ( Chen and Schuster 2004, Musch et al 2007) and after inhalation of cigarette smoke ( Schroeder et al 2007 ). In human subjects increases in FDG uptake have been found in several conditions characterized by inflammation, such as respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia ( Jones et al 1997), cystic fibrosis (Chen et al 2006), sarcoidosis ( Brudin et al 1994, Xiu et al 2005), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( Jones et al 2003). The ability to quantify a component of the inflammatory response with FDG- PET/CT suggests that it might also be useful for learning more about the pathogenesis of asthma, phenotypic differences, and responses to anti- inflammatory therapies. 1.2. Name and Description of Investigational Product Reslizumab (CEP -38072) is a humanized anti-human interleukin-5 (anti- hIL-5) monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) of the immunoglobulin G4/κ isotype being developed for administration by the intravenous (iv) and subcutaneous routes. CINQAIR® (reslizumab iv 3 mg/kg) was recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the add -on maintenanc e treatment of patients with severe asthma aged 18 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype. A more detailed description of the product is given in Section 3.9. 1.3. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studie s 1.3.1. Nonclinical Studies A correlation between IL -5–induced eosinophilia and pulmonary hyper- reactivity was originally suggested by studies in the IL-5 gene knockout mouse ( Foster et al 1996). When sensitized and challenged with antigen, mice lacking the IL -5 gene failed to develop airway eosinophilia, accumulate lung damage, or demonstrated any increased airway hyper -responsiveness. Otherwise, IL -5 gene knockout mice developed normally and had normal antibody and cytotoxic T-cell responses. In vitro, reslizumab bound with high affinity to IL-5 from several species (mouse, rat, and monkey); in vivo, reslizumab showed biological activity in all species mentioned above plus guinea pig and rabbit. Reslizumab inhibited eosinophilia in lungs or skin and reduced airway hyper -responsiveness after antigenic challenge in sensitized animals. Inhibition of pulmonary eosinophilia was observed for up to 8 weeks post-dose in mice and for up to 6 months in"
28,page_28,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protoc ol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 28 monkeys. Reslizumab’s effects on eosinophilia in mice were additive with the effects of prednisolone. In single -dose iv toxicity studies with reslizumab, no adverse effects were observed at the maximum doses administered (500 mg/kg in mice and rats; 100 mg/kg in monkeys). In repeat dose studies, reslizumab was well tolerated by mice and monkeys given 2 iv doses of 1, 5, or 25 mg/kg reslizumab 14 days apart; the no- observed -effect level was 5 mg/kg in male mice and at least 25 mg/kg in female mice and monkeys. The 6 -month studies in mice and monkeys with once-monthly dosing showed no toxicity and a no-observed- effect level of at least 25 mg/kg. The no-observed- effect level for evidence of reslizumab -related binding to nervous system tissues of monkeys was also at least 25 mg/kg. Reslizumab was not genotoxic and did not affect reproductive parameters. In safety pharmacology studies, reslizumab had no effect on parameters related to organ function. Further details may be found in the current United States ( US) Prescribing Information (PI) for CINQ AIR (reslizumab) (CINQAIR 2016). 1.3.2. Clinical Studies 1.3.2.1. Clinical Pharmacology Studies The pharmacokine tics (PK), pharmacodynamics , immunogenicity, and safety of iv reslizumab over the dose range of 0.03 mg/kg through 3 mg/kg have bee n characterized in 14 studies in patients and in healthy subjects. Systemic exposure to reslizumab increases in a dose-proportional manner over the range of 0.03 to 3.0 mg/kg in patients with asthma and from 1.0 to 3.0 mg/kg in patients with nasal polyps. Serum concentration declines from peak in a biphasic manner with a mean elimination half-life of 24 days. The volume of distribution for reslizumab is low (approximately 4 to 6 L), suggesting minimal distribution of resliz umab into extravascular tissues . Further details may be found in the current PI ( CINQAIR 2016). 1.3.2.2. Clinical Safety and Efficacy Studies A total of 2195 healthy volunteers and patients with moderate to severe asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis, eosinophilic gastritis, hypereosinophilic syndrome, or nasal polyposis had received at least 1 dose of reslizumab in 14 clinical studies. The Phase 3 BREATH program in adult and adolescent asthma evaluated the safety and efficacy of reslizumab administered iv every 4 weeks at 3 mg/kg (16 -week Studies C38072/3081 and C38072/3084, 52-week Studies C38072/3082 and C38072/3083, and open label safety extension Study C38072/3085) and 0.3 mg/kg (Study C38072/3081 only). A significant reduction in the annual rate of asthma exacerbatio ns, and significant improvements in lung function, asthma related quality of life, and patient reported measures of asthma control (ACQ and Asthma Symptom Utility Index [ASUI]) were observed for patients with eosinophilic asthma defined by a screening bloo d eosinophil count of ≥400/μL (Studies C38072/3081, C38072/3082, and C38072/3083). In asthma patients without elevated blood eosinophils (Study C38072/3084), reslizumab produced non-significant improvements in lung function and other measures of efficacy. In contrast, patients with blood eosinophil levels ≥400/μL in this study demonstrated"
29,page_29,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protoc ol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 29 significant improvements in lung function and other measures of efficacy following treatment with reslizumab . The safety of reslizumab was evaluated in adults and in children in clinical studies. Single or multiple doses of iv reslizumab from 0.03 through 3.0 mg/kg were well tolerated with a common adverse event profile similar to placebo. The majority of adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity, and most adverse events were assessed as unrelated to study drug, as determined by the investigator. The safety profile of reslizumab, 3 mg/kg iv, in patients with asthma is reflected in the US PI ( CINQAIR 2016). The following summa ry relates to integrated adverse events data of the 5 asthma placebo -controlled completed studies (ie, Studies Res-5-0010, C38072/3081, C38072/3082, C38072/3083, and C30872/3084) that include the 3 mg/kg iv dose and every 4 weeks dosing regimen (up to 52 weeks). Serious adverse events and deaths from the open- label Study C38072/3085 are also included in the relevant sections. Common Adverse Events The most common preferred terms (reported in >5% of patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group) were asthma (23 2 [23%] and 289 [40%] patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg and placebo groups, respectively), nasopharyngitis (103 [10%] and 103 [14%] patients, respectively), upper respiratory tract infection (96 [9%] and 69 [10%] patients, respectively), headache (78 [8%] and 62 [9%] patients, respectively), and sinusitis (57 [6%] and 51 [7%] patients, respectively). The incidence of all common adverse events (>2%) was the same or higher in the placebo group compared to the reslizumab group with the exception of oropharyngeal pain, which was slightly higher in the 3.0 mg/kg reslizumab-treated patients (2.6%) than in the placebo- treated patients (2.2%). Serious Adverse Events The incidence of serious adverse events was similar in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg treatment group (6%) compared with the placebo treatment group (9%). The serious adverse event reported with the highest incidence was asthma (preferred terms of asthma, asthma crisis, and status asthmaticus), reported by 24 (3%) patients in the placebo group and 24 (2%) patients in the reslizumab 3.0 mg/kg group. Three serious adverse events of anaphylaxis events were assessed as related to reslizumab treatment. Deaths There were 4 deaths in the Phase 3 asthma clinical development program : 1 death occurred in a placebo -treated patient and 3 deaths occurred in the ongoing open-label study (Study C38072/3085). None of the deaths were considered related to reslizumab. Laboratory Findings Overall, laboratory test values were similar in patients treated with reslizumab and place bo, with the exception of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation and the expected pharmacological effect of decreasing blood eosinophil counts. There were no clinically meaningful differences or potentially clinically important trends in vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) intervals, or overall ECG assessments. Adverse Drug Reactions"
30,page_30,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protoc ol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 30 Anaphylaxis Anaphylaxis related to reslizumab infusion has been reported and is considered an adverse drug reaction (ADR). All cases of anaphylaxis early in the drug development occurred in the eosinophilic esophagitis studies and were deemed by the investigator as related to known food allergies /immunotherapy , and not to reslizumab. In the Phase 3 BREATH program, 3 infusion- related reactions, reported as anaphylaxis, occurred during or shortly after reslizumab infusion and were characterized variously by dyspnea, decreased oxygen saturation,wheezing, vomiting , and skin and mucosal involvement, including urtcaria . The 3 events were treated at the study site, and patients were wi thdrawn from the study. Oropharyngeal pain Adverse reactions that occurred at greater than or equal to 2% incidence and more commonly than in the placebo group included 1 event: oropharyngeal pain (2.6% versus 2.2%). CPK elevations and muscle- related adverse reactions Elevated baseline CPK was more frequent in patients randomized to reslizumab (14%) versus placebo (9%). Transient CPK elevations in patients with normal baseline CPK values were observed more frequently with reslizumab (20%) versus placebo (18%) during routine laboratory assessments. CPK elevations >10x the upper limit of normal ( ULN ), regardless of baseline CPK value, were 0.8% in the CINQAIR group compared to 0.4% in the placebo group. CPK elevations >10x ULN were asymptomatic and did not lead to treatment discontinuation. Myalgia was reported in 1% (10/1028) of patients in the reslizumab 3 mg/kg group compared to 0.5% (4/730) of patients in the placebo group. On the day of infusion, musculoskeletal adverse reactions were reported in 2.2% and 1.5% of patients treated with reslizumab 3 mg/kg and placebo, respectively. These reactions included (but were not limited to) musculoskeletal chest pain, neck pain, muscle spasms, extremity pain, muscle fatigue, and musculoskeletal pain. Malignancy The imp act of lowering eosinophils with an anti -IL-5 active substance, such as reslizumab on the development of malignancies is not known. In placebo-controlled iv clinical studies, 6 out of 1028 patients (0.6%) receiving 3 mg/kg reslizumab had at least 1 maligna nt neoplasm reported compared to 2 out of 730 patients (0.3%) in the placebo group. The observed malignancies in reslizumab treated patients were diverse in nature and without clustering of any particular tissue type. The majority of malignancies were diag nosed within less than 6 months of exposure to reslizumab. Additional Safety Issues Pregnancy The safety of reslizumab in pregnant women or developing fetus has not been studied, but nonclinical and clinical studies raised no specific concerns. As of May 2015, there have been 12 pregnancies during the entire clinical development of reslizumab, 4 of which occurred during the screening period of the study and 8 in patients receiving reslizumab. All patients were withdrawn from the study. Two of the 8 pregnancies were terminated by an elective abortion with no complications, and 5 led to the birth of full-term infants with no malformations and no obstetric or perinatal complications. One pregnancy outcome is unknown."

In general, the ADA responses were low in titer and often transient and were not associated with an effect on reslizumab concentration, eosinophil count, or specific clinical manifestations (including hypersensitivity reactions). Neutralizing antibodies and product- specific IgE antibodies were not evaluated. Further details may be found in the c urrent PI (CINQAIR 2016). 1.4. Known and Potential Benefits and Risks to Patients 1.4.1. Benefits and Risks of Reslizumab Information regarding the risks and benefits of reslizumab to human patients may be found in the current PI (CINQAIR 2016 ). 1.4.1.1. Benefits of Reslizumab As described in Section 1.3.2, results from clinical studies indicate improved asthma control and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1). 1.4.1.2. Risk s of Reslizumab Most clinical safety data for reslizumab are based on the experience with iv administration of the drug. As described in Section 1.3.2, iv reslizumab has been generally well tolerated over the range of doses evaluated (ie, from 0.03 through 3 mg/kg). Severe systemic reactions (including anaphylaxis), myalgia, elevated CPK, malignancy and oropharyngeal pain are considered as ADRs of iv reslizumab. Additional information regarding the risks and benef its of reslizumab to human patients may be found in the current PI ( CINQAIR 2016). 1.4.2. Risks of Computerized Tomography/Positron Emission Tomography Scans 1.4.2.1. Risks of Fludeoxyglucose F 18 Injection Use in patients with diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia has not been well studied. It is recommended that patients be normoglycemic when undergoing positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with Fludeoxyglucose (FDG) F 18 injection. Additional information regarding the risks and benefits of FDG to human patients may be found in the current PI ( FDG 2014 ). 1.4.2.2. Risks of Computerized Tomography/Positron Emission Tomography Scans Potential risks from the stud y assessment procedures are low; FDG-PET/ computed tomogr aphy (CT) scans are associated with: 1. small radiation dose from the radiolabe led glucose and low dose CT"
32,page_32,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protoc ol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 32 2. incidental findings that will be communicated to the participants themselves and to their primar y health care providers 3. allergic reactions to the glucos e tracer, which are rare and have not been reported within the past decade. To minimize radiation -absorbed dose to the bladder, adequate hydration should be encouraged to permit frequent voiding during the first few hours after intravenous administration of FDG injection. This may be achieved by having patients drink at least an 8 oz glass of water prior to drug administration. To help protect themselves and others in their environment, patients should take the following precautions for 12 hours after injection: whenever possible, a toilet should be used and should be flushed several times after each use and hands should be washed thoroughly after each voiding or fecal elimination. If blood, urine or feces soil clothing, the clothing should be washed separately. The exposure to radiation from this study is not significant and is within the acceptable range for research studies involving the use of radiotracers as outlined by the regulatory agencies. The radiation dose from FDG and the PET/CT scan is not nece ssary for medical care and will occur only as a result of subject participation in the study. At doses much higher than the subject will receive in this study, radiation is known to increase the risk of developing cancer after many years. At the doses of r adiation subjects will receive in this study, it is very likely that they will see no effects at all. 1.4.3. Overall Benefit and Risk Assessment for This Study This is a research study exploring the effect of a single dose of reslizumab iv 3 mg/kg on biomarkers of lung inflammation. Therefore, no direct benefit to the participant is expected. However, information obtained from this study may benefit patients in the future by establishing the validity of a non- invasive measure of lung inflammation for asthma resear ch purposes and for clinical assessment of severe eosinophilic asthma. 1.5. Selection of Drugs and Doses A detailed description of study drug administration is presented in Section 5.1. 1.5.1. Justification for Dose of Active Drug The dose to be evaluated in this double blind study is 3.0 mg/kg administered every 4 weeks as per the US PI for CINQAIR (reslizumab). 1.5.2. Justification for Use of Placebo A placebo control design is scientifically appropriate because placebo will be compared against reslizumab added on to the patients established treatment regimen. Patients will not be taken off their standard of care asthma therapy for this study. 1.6. Compliance Statement This study will be conducted in full accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Harmonised Tripartide Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) E6 and any applicable national and local laws and regulations (eg, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations"

Purpose of the Study The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that reslizumab reduces lung inflammation in patients with eosinophilic asthma. 2.2. Study Objectives 2.2.1. Primary Objective There are 2 related primary objectives of this study: 1. To establish that positron emission tomography (PET)/computerized tomography (CT) imaging of the lung can reliably distinguish healthy, non -asthmatic volunteers and patients with severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype (initial validation). 2. If the utility of PET/CT scanning is established as per objective 1: to show that reslizumab produces a reduction in signal intensity (reduction in lung i nflammation) in patients with severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype. 2.2.2. Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives of the study are: • to demonstrate a correlation between the benefit observed on imaging (PET/CT) with : − reductions blood eosinophil counts − improvement in clinic visit lung function − reductions in fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) − improvements in Asthma Quality of Life questionnaire (AQLQ) scores 2.2.3. Exploratory Objectives Exploratory objectives are: • to demonstrate a correlation between changes in the lung PET /CT signal produced by reslizumab and serum biological markers of asthmatic inflammation • to demonstrate a correlation between changes in the lung PET /CT signal produced by reslizumab and other lung function variables including forced vi tal capacity (FVC), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and forced expiratory flow at the 25% point to the 75% point of forced vital capacity (FEF 25%-75%) • to demonstrate that reslizumab produces greater reductions in inflammation of whole-body lymph nodes and bone marrow than placebo as seen on PET/CT • for those patients that can produce sputum, to demonstrate an association between changes in sputum eosinophil numbers produced by reslizumab and the lung PET/CT signal produced by reslizumab"

General Design and Study Schema tic Diagram This is a 7- week, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the effect of reslizumab administered at 3.0 mg/kg in adult patients with eosinophilic asthma . The study will consist of a sc reening period (up to 21 days ), a 6- week, double- blind treatment/assessment period, and a follow-up telephone contact (7±3 days after last visit). All subjects who participate in this study will consent at prior to undergoing any study procedures. After consent is obtained, all participants will undergo all tests and procedures required for eligibility, including sputum and blood eosinophil level assessments. Patients with asthma (does not apply to HC subjects) must have a screening blood eosinophil count of ≥400 cells/μL to be included. A maximum of 3 screening blood eosinophil assessments will be conducted. If the 1st assessment yields a blood eosinophil level below 400 cells/µL patients with asthma may return for a 2nd assessment of blood eosinophil level after 7 days. A 3rd and final assessment will be performed 7 days after the 2nd assessment, if necessary (eg, if the blood eosinophil leve l remains <400 cells/μL at the 2nd assessment). The patient m ust maintain their usual asthma controller regimen without change throughout the screening and study periods. A patient who experiences an asthma exacerbation during this time that requires additional medication, beyond increased SA BA use, will be considered to have failed screening and cannot undergo randomization. A patient may be rescreened for this reason 1 time only. If a patient experiences an asthma exacerbation requiring treatment with systemic steroids, they will only be allowed to be rescreened 6 weeks after completion of treatment. All patients that have to be rescreened must be stable on other asthma medications for 30 days prior to rescreening. The DEAR study is designed in 2 parts. Part 1 is a validation step whereby the sponsor wishes to deter mine (1) the intrapatient reproducibility in the GLG measure, and (2) the difference in the GLG measure between individual patients with severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype (1-by-1) and the entire HC group. Limits for both the reproducibility with in patients and difference among the 2 groups have been provided by subject matter experts. Part 2 will be a 7 -week double-blind evaluation of patients with severe asthma with an eosinophilic phenotype that have been randomized to receive a single dose of either placebo or reslizumab at 3 mg/kg. Part 1 Within 7 days (±3 days) of eligibility being confirmed, participants will have a PET/CT scan as per the PET/CT scan protocol described in Part 2 below. Participants will return to the 7 days (±3) after the first PET/CT scan (taken during visit 2) for a second PET/CT scan following the same procedures described above. HC subjects (n=5) may also have a second sputum induction and blood sample collection at with 1 day of the 2 nd PET/CT scan, if feasible (preferred but not required). Healthy subjects will be considered"
38,page_38,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protoc ol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 38 complete at this time. Only after all 5 HC s have completed the study will patients with asthma be screened . If the relative difference in GLG (based on t he average of the 2 measurements) between healthy and asthma patients will be ≥5%, then the asthma patients will be randomized. A 10% variability (measured as relative difference between first measurement and second measurement) between PET/CT scans as measured by GLG within each group will be considered as the maximum allowed variability. The part 1 criteria have been set at these levels to observe a difference between the healthy subjects and patients with asthma and to ensure intra-group reproducibility; the criteria are based on the investigators’ prior experience. If these exploratory criteria are not met (eg, 8 or more patients do not meet the criteria to enter Part 2 [inclusion criteria k and l]) , then the study will be reevaluated. Part 2 If eligible (eg, if inter - and intra- group GLG variability criteria are met), patients will be randomized. This may occur at any time after confirmation of eligibility and up to the time of dosing. Patients will return to for baseline clinical, ser ological, and biochemical measures at the Clinical Research Center (CRC) according to standard procedures. Once these are completed, patients will receive either placebo or reslizumab and will receive the infusion at . Any new serious adverse events, reslizumab -related adverse events, and new concomitant medications will be reported. All planned PET/CT scans (weeks 2, 4, and 6) should be scheduled at the time of randomization. Within 2 weeks (±3 days) of the infusion, patients will return to for clinical tests and procedures. Within 3 days of this visit, patients will undergo a PET/CT scan at the . Patients repeat the clinical tests and procedures at weeks 4 and 6 post-infusion. Each visit at will be followed by a PET/CT scan at the as described above. PET/CT scan procedure A PET/CT scan consent will be signed before any PET/CT scan procedures are initiated. Patients will undergo a whole- body FDG 18 F -PET/CT scan using the standard protocol ( Section 6.1.1). Image Analysis Axial, sagittal, and coronal PET reconstructions will be interpreted, with and without attenuation correction, using non- contrast CT images for anatomical correlation. The investigators plan to measure global and regional inflammation within the lung, lymph nodes and bone marrow by utilizing quantitative parameters based on both volume and SUV. Standardized uptake value is a well validated mea sure which normalizes FDG uptake by any particular object/tissue volume by the administered dose and either total body weight or total body surface area. Regions of interest (ROIs) will be drawn manually around the outer boundaries of the lung on every tra nsverse slice passing through the lung on fused FDG PET/CT images from each subject. The trachea and main stem bronchi will be excluded from the ROIs to capture only the inflammation in the lung parenchyma. Lung sectional mean standardized uptake value (sSUV mean) and the area of the lung ROI will be recorded from each slice. Subsequently, the sectional lung volume (sLV) will be calculated from each slice by multiplying the lung ROI area (in centimeters squared) by 0.4 (slice thickness 4 mm). The sectional lung glycolysis (sLG) will be determined by multiplying"
39,page_39,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protoc ol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 39 sLV and lung sSUV mean from each slice. The lung volume (LV) will be calculated by adding all the sLV from slices passing through the lung, and the GL G will be determined by adding all the sLG from sl ices passing through the lung. Finally, the lung SUV mean will be calculated by dividing the GLG by the LV. Applying this methodology to different tissues or regions of the lungs will allow us to determine average and global SUV measures for the following tissues: whole lung parenchyma, right and left lung parenchyma, trachea, bronchi, and right and left bronchi. These regions will be delineated in the CT images by using the image segmentation techniques. These tissue volumes will be registered with the PET images as outlined below for the estimation of SUVs within these regions. Similar methodology will be applied to the lymph nodes and bone marrow. The assessments and procedures performed during each study visit are detailed in Table 2 and Section 3.14. If a patient elects to withdraw (or is discontinued from treatment by the investigator), every attempt will be made to continue the assessments subsequent to his/her withdra wal from the study (see Section 4.4).

42,page_42,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protoc ol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 42 Table 1: Rationale for Protocol Area Rationale Conducting the study To date, there has been no report of direct visualization of whole lung inflammation in asthmatic patients treated with placebo versus an anti-IL-5 therapy. In addition, there has been no report on the rapidity by which an anti- IL-5 therapy can affect whole lung inflammation in asthmatic patients. Study population Patients with eosinophilic asthma and HC s, males and females that are between the ages of 18 and 50. Patient with asthma must have a current blood eosinophil levels of at least 400/µL on ≥440 μg of fluticasone-equivalent and a LABA or any allowed additional treatment to control asthma symptoms. Study design Single -center, placebo -controlled, double- blinded, parallel -group, imaging study as Part 1 (validation) and Part 2 (evaluation) Investigational product dosage regimen and duration of treatment Reslizumab (CEP -38072), 3.0 mg/kg, iv, 1 administration only Choice of comparison drug( s) (placebo, active, reference) Placebo Number of subjects (including number per treatment group) Fifteen in Part I (5 as HCs, including a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 3 females, and 10 patients with eosinophilic asthma, including a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 6 females). The latter group will advance to Part 2 with 5 patients randomized to placebo and 5 patients randomized to reslizumab. Key inclusion and exclusion criteria See above Treatment blinding (ie, rationale for blinded or open- label design) Each patient will be assigned a unique identifier number and all reference to the patient will be using this identifier. Double- blinding is important to ensure that the treatment effect of reslizumab is truly ascribed to the treatment. Primary analysis ( measure, variable, time point, statistical test) The primary efficacy variable is the update of FDG in the whole lung between placebo - and reslizumab- treated patients as measured by ΔGLG. The supportive primary efficacy variable will be the ΔLP SUV mean. A ll measurements made at 2 baseline visits and at weeks 2, 4, and 6 post-randomization. The ΔGLG will be described using descriptive statistics. No statistical testing will be conducted. Inclusion of ancillary studies: PK, PD , immunogenicity A number of biomarkers will be evaluated to monitor whether they change as part of the response to treatment. Anti-drug antibodies will be evaluated for all patients."

Primary and Secondary Efficacy Measures and Time Points A description of the efficacy measures is provided in Section 6. 3.3.1. Primary Efficacy Measure and Time Point s GLG will be measured at 2 baseline visits and at weeks 2, 4, and 6 (all ±3 days) post randomization. 3.3.2. Secondary Efficacy Measures and Time Points The secondary efficacy measures and time points for this study are as follows:: − blood eosinophil counts from baseline to weeks 2, 4, and 6 (all ±3 days) − FEV 1 from baseline to weeks 2, 4, and 6 (all ±3 days) − FeNO measurements from baseline to weeks 2, 4, and 6 (all ±3 days) − AQLQ scores from baseline to weeks 2, 4, and 6 (all ±3 days) 3.4. Safety Measures and Time Points Patient safety will be assessed by standard asthma management and phy sician practice. If a patient experiences an asthma exacerbation during Part 1, they will be treated with oral corticosteroids (OCS) for a period of 2 weeks, followed by a 6- week observation period without OCS to ensure asthma control. Stable patients will then re- enter the study at the time point of the exacerbation. The following safety measures will be implemented during the study: • occurrence of adverse events throughout the study • vital signs (pulse, respiratory rate, and blood pressure) throughout the study • clinical laboratory evaluations throughout the study • physical examination findings throughout the study"

Pharmacokinetic Measures and Time Points Pharmacokinetics will not be assessed in this study . 3.6. Exploratory Efficacy Measures and Time Points The exploratory efficacy measures and time points are: • biological markers of inflammation and asthma: − IgE − DPP4 − 25-hydroxy vitamin D − eotaxin -1, -2, and -3 − TARC − MCP -1 and MCP-4 − ILC2 • lung function variables: − FVC − PEFR − FEF 25%-75% • the global uptake of FDG in the lymph nodes and bone marrow as measured by the PET/ CT imaging parameters indicated for the primary efficacy variable • for those patients that can produce sputum, to demonstrate a correlation between reductions in inflammation by reslizumab with a reduction in sputum eosinophils All variables will be measured at 1 (biomarkers only) or 2 baseline visits and at weeks 2, 4, and 6 post-randomization. 3.7. Randomization and Blinding This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. After the 2 baseline PET/CT scans and successful completion of all requirements (Part 1), patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 in a double-blind fashion to receive either placebo or iv 3.0 mg/kg reslizumab. In order to maintain the blind, each patient will be assigned a unique identifier number and all reference to the patient will be by using this identifier. Patients will be randomly assigned to treatment groups by means of a computer- generated randomization list. The specifications for randomization will be under the responsibility and"
45,page_45,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protoc ol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 45 oversight of Teva Global Statistics. The output of the randomization process will be a pati ent randomization list. The sponsor’s clinical personnel involved in the study will be blinded to the study drug identity until the database is locked for analysis and the treatment assignment is revealed, with the exception of the bioanalytical group who will not be blinded to facilitate ADA sample analysis and an un-blinded person who will be responsible for randomization assignment. Additionally, in order to maintain the study blind, blood and sputum eosinophil levels assessed after study drug administra tion will not available to investigators, their blinded staff, the sponsor, and blinded members of the clinical research organization. There will be un -blinded data management, un-blinded site staff, and an un-blinded CRA who will not sit on the study team and be responsible for un-blinded eosinophil data. 3.8. Maintenance of Randomization and Blinding 3.8.1. Maintenance of Randomization Patient randomization codes will be maintained in a secure location at the service provider contracted to generate the codes. At the time of analysis (after the end of study), after receiving unblinding request from Teva statistician , the service provider will provide the unblinded treatment assignment according to the processes defined in the relevant Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) . 3.8.2. Blinding/Unblinding For information about personnel who may be aware of treatment assignments, see Section 3.7. These individuals will not be involved in conduct of any study procedures or assessment of any adverse events . An envelope containing individual sealed envelopes that correspond to each study drug package will be provided to the investigational center. The envelopes will contain the randomization number and the name and dose (if applicable) of the study drug for each patient. In case of a serious adverse event, pregnancy, or in cases when knowledge of the study drug assignment is needed to make treatment decisions, the investigator may open the patient’s envelope and unblind the patient’s drug assignment as deemed necessary, mainly in emergency situations. If possible, the sponsor should be notified of the event before breaking of the code. If this is not possible, the sponsor should be notified immediately afterwards and the patient’s drug code assignme nt should not be revealed. All envelopes must be returned to the sponsor at the completion of the study. Breaking of the treatment code can always be performed by the investigational center without prior approval by the sponsor. When a blind is broken, the patient will be withdrawn from the study and the event will be recorded on the case report form (CRF). The circumstances leading to the breaking of the code should be fully documented in the investigator’s study files and in the patient’s source documenta tion. Treatment assignment should not be recorded in any study documents or source document. In blinded studies, for an adverse event defined as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) (ie, reasonable possibility; see Section 7.1.4), Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance may independently request that the treatment code be broken (on a"

Part 1 of the study will validate this measure by comparing this assessment between HC subjects and patients with eosinophilia asthma. In Part 2, only patients with eosinophilic asthma will be assessed for GLG at 2, 4, and 6 weeks, afte r randomization to placebo or treatment with a single dose of reslizumab. 6.1.1. Positron Emission Tomography/Computerized Tomography Scans Patients must fast for 8 hours prior to the scan. Blood glucose level will be measured before the administration of FDG. Blood glucose level should not exceed 150 mg/dL at the time of injection. Whole-body, head- to-toe PET/CT image acquisition will begin about 120 minutes after iv administration of 7 mCi of the radioisotope fluorine-18 ( 18F)-FDG. PET/CT image acquisition will take 30 to 40 minutes. In total, patients will spend about 3 hours in the PET center per each imaging visit. Patients will be asked to return in 2 days for a repeat FDG -PET/CT scan to be used as technical replicates in Part 1. Because 18F has a half -life o f 109 minutes and is effectively fully decayed within a few hours of administration, FDG will be re-administered during the follow up visits and PET/CT imaging will be performed following the same protocol described above. Each FDG -PET/CT scan will deliver about 800 millirem ( mrem ) of radiation to the patient. Because patients will undergo 5 PET/CT scans, it is estimated that patients will receive a total radiation of 4000 mrem, which is within yearly limits set by the To minimize radiation -absorbed dose to the bladder, adequate hydration should be encouraged to permit frequent voiding during the first few hours after iv administration of FDG injection. This may be achieved by having patients drink at least an 8 oz glass of water prior to drug administration. To help protect themselves and others in their environment, patients should take the following precautions for 12 hours after injection: whenever possible, a toilet should be used and should be flushed several times after each use and hands should be washed thoroughly after each voiding or fecal elimination. If blood, urine or feces soil clothing, the clothing should be washed separately . 6.1.2. Image Analysis Axial, sagittal, and coronal PET reco nstructions will be interpreted, with and without attenuation correction, using non- contrast CT images for anatomical correlation. The investigators plan to measure global and regional inflammation within the lung, lymph nodes and bone marrow by utilizing quantitative parameters based on both volume and SUV. SUV is a well validated measure which normalizes FDG uptake by any particular object/tissue volume by the administered dose and either total body weight or total body surface area. Regions of interest (ROIs) will be drawn manually around the outer boundaries of the lung on every transverse slice passing through the lung on fused FDG PET/CT images from each subject. The trachea and main"
62,page_62,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protocol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 62 stem bronchi will be excluded from the ROIs to capture only the infla mmation in the lung parenchyma. Lung sectional mean standardized uptake value (sSUV mean) and the area of the lung ROI will be recorded from each slice. Subsequently, the sLV will be calculated from each slice by multiplying the lung ROI area (in centimete rs squared) by 0.4 (slice thickness 4 mm). The sLG will be determined by multiplying sLV and lung sSUV mean fr om each slice. The LV will be calculated by adding all the sLV from slices passing through the lung, and the GLG will be determined by adding all the sLG from slices passing through the lung. Finally, the lung SUV mean will be calculated by dividing the GLG by the LV. Applying this methodology to different tissues or regions of the lungs will allow us to determine average and global SUV measures for the following tissues: whole lung parenchyma, right and left lung parenchyma, trachea, bronchi, and right and left bronchi. These regions will be delineated in the CT images by using the image segmentation techniques. These tissue volumes will be register ed with the PET images as outlined below for the estimation of SUVs within these regions. Similar methodology will be applied to the lymph nodes and bone marrow. 6.1.3. Calculations The radiology center will determine the following: GLG is the total FDG uptake in the whole lung. An ROI is drawn around lung boundary in each axial slice. SUVmean and area of each ROI is recorded. Using the formula: area*slice thickness the volume of each slice is calculated. Then SUVmean of each slice is multiplied by the volume of the corresponding slice, which will represent the total FDG uptake in one slice. This number for each slice is summed together to provide GLG of that lung. GLG= n=number of slices Intra -patient variability (reproducibility measure): Below is the calculation to determine the intra -patient variability between PET/CT scans as measured by GLG for HCs and patients with eosinophilic asthma. The accepted variability within each group is ≤10% and will be as follows: Relative difference of GLG=(GLG2 -GLG1)/GLG1 Relative difference of G LG=(GLG4 -GLG3)/GLG3 1= First time point (HCs) 2= Second time point (HCs) 3= First time point (patients with eosinophilic asthma) 4= Second time point (patients with eosinophilic asthma)"
63,page_63,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protocol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 63 Variability between HC group and individual patients with eosinophilic asthma: The planned method to assess whether the difference in GLG (ΔGLG) between HC subjects, as a group, and individual patients with eosinophilic asthma is ≥5% and will be as follows: For Females : Relative difference of GLG=(GLG6 i-GLG5f)/GLG5f For Males: Relative difference of GLG=(GLG6 i-GLG5m)/GLG5m 5=average of 1 and 2 6=average of 3 and 4 GLG6 i will be calculated for each individual patient using his/her two measurements, and if that amount is ≥5%, than the patient will be randomized. 6.2. Spirometry Pre-bronchodi lator FEV 1, FVC, and FEF 25%-75% and post-bronchodilator FEV 1 will be measured using spirometry. The FEV 1 is the volume of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs in the first second, measured in liters. The FVC is the volume of air that can be forcibly blown out after full inspiration, measured in liters. The FEF 25%-75% is the forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% forced vital capacity. For post-bronchodilatory spirometry, SABAs, such as salbutamol or albuterol, administered via a metered dose inhal er should be used. Four separate doses (eg, albuterol 360 μg or salbutamol 100 μg ex -valve) should be given by metered dose inhaler, as tolerated. Post-bronchodilator spirometry should be completed a minimum of 15 minutes after dosing of SABA. Spirometry will be done according to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society 2005 procedural guidelines. The National Health and Nutrition Survey III reference equations will be used. 6.3. Asthma Control Questionnaire The ACQ -6 is a validated asthma assessment tool that has been widely used ( Juniper et al 1999). Six questions are self -assessments (completed by the patient). Each item on the ACQ -6 has a possible score ranging from 0 to 6, and the total score is the mean of all responses ( Appendix A ). 6.4. Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire for Patients 12 years and Older The AQLQ +12 is a modified version of the standardized AQLQ, which was developed to measure functional impairments experi enced by adults ≥17 years of age. The A QLQ +12 is valid for patients aged 12 to 70 years and includes 32 questions in 4 domains (symptoms, activity limitation, emotional function, and environmental stimuli) ( Juniper et al 1992, Wyrwich et al 2011). Patients are asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 weeks and score each of the questions on a 7- point scale where 7 = no impairment and 1 = severe impairment (Appendix B )."
64,page_64,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protocol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 64 7. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY In this study, safety will be assessed by qualified study staff by evaluating the following: • Adverse events throughout the study • Clinical laboratory test results (serum chemistry , hematology, and urinalysis) throughout the study • Vital signs (pulse, respiratory rate, body temperature, blood pressure, and SpO 2) throughout the study • Physical examination findings throughout the study • Concomitant medication usage throughout the study 7.1. Adverse Events 7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient a dministered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of whether it has a causal relationship with this treatment. In this study, any adverse event occurring after the clinical study patient has signed the informed consent form should be recorded and reported as an adverse event. An adverse event can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended physical sign, symptom, or laboratory parameter that develops or worsens in severity during the course of this study, or significant worsening of the disease under study, or of any concurrent disease, whether or not considered related to the study drug. A new condition or the worsening of a pre- existing condition will be considered an adverse event. Stable chronic co nditions (such as arthritis) that are present before study entry and do not worsen during this study will not be considered adverse events . Accordingly, an adverse event can include any of the following: • intercurrent illnesses • physical injuries • events poss ibly related to concomitant medication • significant worsening (change in nature, severity, or frequency) of the disease under study or other pre- existing conditions (Note: A condition recorded as pre- existing that is intermittently symptomatic [eg, headache ] and that occurs during this study should be recorded as an adverse event.) • drug interactions • laboratory or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient from the study, are associated with clinical signs and symptoms or a ser ious adverse event, require medical treatment or further diagnostic work up, or are considered by the investigator to be clinically significant (Note: Abnormal laboratory test results at"
65,page_65,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protocol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 65 the screening visit that preclude a patient from entering the study o r receiving study treatment are not considered adverse events.) Worsening of the disease under study (ie, asthma) including asthma exacerbations requiring additional controller medication, will be collected as an efficacy assessment in this study. The aforementioned worsening of asthma should be recorded as an adverse event only if the presentation or outcome is more severe than would typically be expected from the normal course of the disease in a particular patient. 7.1.2. Recording and Reporting of Adverse Even ts For adverse event recording, the study period is defined for each patient as that time period from signature of the I nformed Consent F orm through the end of the follow up period. For this study, the follow up period is defined as 1 week after visit 6 (w eek 6), approximately 7 weeks after the single dose of reslizumab . Adverse events will be collected at each visit, including the follow-up visit, via adverse event inquiry. All adverse events that occur during the defined study period must be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed to the CRF, regardless of the severity or seriousness of the event or judged relationship to the study drug . For serious adverse events, the Serious A dverse E vent Form must be completed and the serious adverse event must be reported immediately (see Section 7.1.5.3.1). The investigator does not need to actively monitor patient s for adverse events once the study has ended. Serious adverse events occurring in a patient after t he end of the study should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures described in Se ction 7.1.5.3.1. At each contact with the patient, the investigator or designee must question the patient about adverse events by asking an open -ended question such as “Have you had any unusual symptoms or medical problems since the last visit? If yes, please describe”. All reported or observed signs and symptoms will be recorded individually, except when considered manifestations of a medical condition or disease state . A precise diagnosis will be recorded whenever possible. When such a diagnosis is made, all related signs, symptoms, and any test findings will be recorded collect ively as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a serious adverse event, on the Serious A dverse E vent F orm. The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until resolved , stabilized , or returned to baseline; or until the patient is referred for continued care to a health care professional ; or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made. The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24 hours), action taken regarding study drug, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be recorded on the source documentation and transcribed to the CRF. The approximate time of onset for each adverse event that starts within 24 hours of s tudy drug administration will be also recorded. The relationship of each adverse event to study drug and study procedures, and the severity and seriousness of each adverse event, as judged by the investigator, must be recorded as described below."
66,page_66,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protocol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 66 7.1.3. Severity of an Adverse Event The severity of each adverse event must be recorded as 1 of the choices on the following scale: Mild: No limitation of usual activities Moderate: Some limitation of usual activities Severe: Inability to carry out usual activities 7.1.4. Relati onship of an Adverse Event to the Study Drug The relationship of an adverse event to the study drug is characterized as follows: Term Definition Clarification No reasonable possibility (not related) This category applies to adverse events that , after careful consideration, are clearly due to extraneous causes (disease, environment, etc) or to adverse events that, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, are judged to be unrelated to the study drug. The relationship of an adverse event may be considered “no reasonable possibility” if it is clearly due to extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply: • It does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from the administration of the study drug. • It could readily have been produced by the patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the patient. • It does not follow a known pattern of response to the study drug. • It does not reappear or worsen when the study drug is re-admin istered . Reasonable possibility (related) This category applies to adverse events for which, after careful medical consideration at the time they are evaluated, a connection with the study drug administration cannot be ruled out with certainty . The relati onship of an adverse event may be considered “reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the following apply: • It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study drug. • It cannot be reasonably explained by the known characteristics of t he patient’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors , or other modes of therapy administered to the patient. • It disappears or decreases on cessation or reduction in dose. There are important exceptions when an adverse event does not disappear after discontinuation of the study drug, yet a drug relationship clearly exists. • It follows a known pattern of response to the study drug. 7.1.5. Serious Adverse Events 7.1.5.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes or actions: • results in death"
67,page_67,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protocol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 67 • is life -threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event); it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe • requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, which means that hospital inpatient admission or prolongation of hospital stay were required for treatment of an adverse event, or that they occurred as a consequence of the event Hospitalizations scheduled before the patient signed the informed consent form will not be considered serious adverse events, unless there was worsening of the preexisting condition during the patient’s participation in this study. • results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (refers to a substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions) • is a congenital anomaly/birth defect • an important medical event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient and may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Note: Any suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an important medical event. An adverse event that does not meet any of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be regarded as a nonserious adverse event. 7.1.5.2. Expectedness A serious adverse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of the relevant reference safety information (RSI) by its specificity, severity, outcome, or frequency is considered an unexpected adverse event. The RSI for this study is the US prescribing information for reslizumab and for FDG. 7.1.5.3. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event 7.1.5.3.1. Investigator Responsibil ity To satisfy regulatory requirements, a ll serious adverse events (as described in Section 7.1.5.1) that occur during the study period (including the protocol-defined follow-up period, described in Section 7.1.2), regardless of judged relationship to treatment with the study drug, must be reported to the sponsor by the investigator . The event must be reported within 24 hours of when the investigator learns about it. Completing the serious a dverse event form and reporting the event must not be delayed, even if not all the information is available. The investigator does not need to actively monitor patients for adverse events once this study has ended. Serious adverse event s occurring to a patient after the treatment of that patient has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them ."
68,page_68,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protocol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 68 The serious a dverse event form should be sent to the local safety officer ( LSO ) or (contact information is in the Clinical Study Personnel Contact Information section); the LSO will forward the report to the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilance. The following information should be provided to record the event accurately and completely: • study num ber • investigator and investigational center identification • patient number • onset date and detailed description of adverse event • investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the study drug (no reasonable possibility, reasonable possi bility) Additional information may include the following: • age and sex of patient • date of first dose of study drug • date and amount of last administered dose of study drug • action taken • outcome, if known • severity • explanation of assessment of relatedness • conco mitant medication (including doses, routes of administration , and regimens) and treatment of the event • pertinent laboratory or other diagnostic test data • medical history • results of dechallenge/rechallenge, if known • for an adverse event resulting in death: − cause of death (whether or not the death was related to study drug) − autopsy findings (if available) The investigator must ensure that the IEC/IRB is also informed of the event, in accordance with national and local regulations. Each report of a serious adverse event will be reviewed and evaluated by the investigator and the sponsor to assess the nature of the event and the relationship of the event to the study drug, study procedures, and to underlying disease. Additional information (follow-up) about any s erious adverse event unavailable at the initial reporting should be forwarded by the investigat or within 24 hours of when it becomes known to the same address as the initial report ."
69,page_69,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protocol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 69 For all countries, the sponsor’s Global Patient Safety and Pharmacovigilan ce will distribute the Council for International Organizat ions of Medical Sciences form/ Extensible Markup Language file to the LSO for submission to the competent authorities , IEC/IRBs , and investigators, according to regulations. T he investigator is responsible for ensuring that the I EC/IRB is also informed of the event, in accordance with national and local regulations. Blinding will be maintained for all clinical study personnel . Therefore, in case of a SUSAR, only the LSO will receive the unblinded report for regulatory submission; the others will receive a blinded report. Note: Although pregnancy is not a serious adverse event, the process for reporting a pregnancy is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event , but using the pregnancy form (see Section 7.2). 7.1.5.3.2. Sponsor Responsibility If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the study drug or study procedures, the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify the appropriate co mpetent authorities (and IEC/IRB, as appropriate). In addition to notifying the investigators and competent authorities (and IEC/IRB, as appropriate), other measures may be required, including: • altering existing research by modifying the protocol • discontinuing or suspending the study • altering the process of informed consent by modifying the existing consent form and informing all study participants of new findings • modifying listings of expected toxicities to include adverse events newly identified as related to reslizumab. 7.1.6. Protocol -Defined Adverse Events for Expedited Reporting to Teva For the purposes of this protocol, the following are considered protocol- defined adverse events for expedited reporting to Teva: anaphylaxis, newly-diagnosed malignancy, and parasitic helminth and opportunistic infections. Protocol-defined adverse events for expedited reporting can be either serious or nonserious according to the criteria outlined in Section 7.1.5.1. The process for re porting a protocol- defined adverse event for expedited reporting is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event (see Section 7.1.5.3). 7.1.7. Specific Adverse Event Case Report Form Capturing 7.1.7.1. Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity Reactions Case Report Form Information about all suspected anaphylaxis events will be recorded on the Suspected Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity Reactions CRF, which is based on the 2006 Joint NIAID/FAAN Second Symposium on Anaphylaxis ( Sampson et al 2006, Appendix C ). The Anaphylaxis/Hypersensitivity Reactions CRF should be initiated in real time (along with vital sign assessment) for events occurring after study drug administration in the clinic or as soon as possible for suspect events outside the clinic."
70,page_70,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protocol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 70 Blood samples for ADA testing should be taken in any case where hypersensitivity is suspected to be rel ated to study drug/placebo administration. 7.1.7.2. Creatine Phosphokinase/M uscular Adverse Events Case Report Form Potentially clinically significant CPK elevations (with or without associated symptoms) or myalgia/muscle symptoms will be recorded as an adverse event and documented using the potentially clinically significant CPK/myalgia case report form. A potentially clinically significant CPK is defined as ≥3.1× ULN (Grade 3 based on the FDA “Guidance for Industry Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy Adult and Adolescent Volunteers Enrolled in Preventative Vaccine Clinical Trials”). 7.1.8. Withdrawal Due to an Adverse Event Any patient who experiences an adverse event may be withdrawn from the study or from study treatment at any time at the discretion of the investigator. If a patient is withdrawn wholly or in part because of an adverse event, both the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF will be completed at that time. The patient will be monitored at the discretion of the investigator (eg, until the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the ca re of a health care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the study drug or study procedure is made). The investigator must inform the Sponsor’s Authorized Representative as soon as possible of each patient who is being considered for withdrawal due to adverse events. Additional reports must be provided when requested. If a patient is withdrawn from study for multiple reasons that include adverse events, the termination page of the CRF should indicate that the withdrawal was related to an adverse event. An exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an adverse event that in the opinion of the investigator is not severe enough to warrant discontinuation but that requires the use of a prohibited medication, thereby requiring discontinuation of the patient. In such a case, the reason for discontinuation would be need to take a prohibited medication, not the adverse event. 7.1.9. Overdose of Study Drug Any dose of study drug (whether the investigational product, reference treatment, or placebo), whether taken intentionally or unintentionally, in excess of that prescribed must be immediately reported to the sponsor. When the identification of the study drug must be known, the investigator must follow the procedures outlined in Section 3.8. Any administration of medication that is not in accordance with the study protocol should be reported on the CRF, either as a violation or as a deviation, in the patient’s source documents, regardless of whe ther an adverse event occurs as a result. See Section 7.3 for additional information. 7.1.10. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency, deviation s from the protocol may be allowed on a case- by-case basis . To ensure patient safety, after the event has stabilized or treatment has been administered (or both), the investigator or other physician in attendance must"
71,page_71,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protocol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 71 contact the physician identified in the Clinical Study Personnel Contact Information section of this protocol as soon as possible to discuss the situation. The investigator, in consultation with the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in the study. 7.2. Pregnancy Any female patient becoming pregnant during the study will discontinue study medication . All pregnancies of women participating in the study that occur during the study, or within 5 months after study medication infusion, are to be reported immediately to the individual identified in the Clinical Study Personnel Contact Information section of this protocol, and the investigator must provide the sponsor (LSO) with the completed pregnancy form. The process for reporting a pregnancy is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event but using the pregnancy form (Section 7.1.5.3). All female patients who become pregnant will be monitored for the outcome of the pregnancy (including spontaneous, elective, or voluntary abortion). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of the infant up to 8 weeks of age), including details of birth and presence or absence of any birth defect, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be reporte d to the sponsor. Any complication of pregnancy during the study and any complication of pregnancy that the investigator becomes aware of after withdrawal from the study will be reported as an adverse event or serious adverse event, as appropriate. If the pregnancy in the woman participating in the study does not continue to term, 1 of the following actions will be taken: • For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event. • For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serio us adverse event. • For an elective abortion not due to developmental anomalies, report on the pregnancy form; do not report as an adverse event. 7.3. Medication Error and Special Situation s Any administration of study medication that is not in accordance with th e study protocol should be reported on the CRF either as a violation, if it meets the violation criteria specified in the protocol (Section 11.1.2), or as a deviation, in the patients source documents, regardless of whether an adverse event occurs as a result . All instances of incorrect medication administration should be categorized on the CRF as “ Non-Compliance to investigational medicinal product (IMP)”. Types of m edication errors and special situations: 1. Medication error: Any unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or administration of a medicinal product while in the control of the healthcare professional, patient , or consumer. 2. Overdose: Administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given per administration or cumulatively which is above the maximum recommended dose according to the authorized product information. Clinical judgment should always be applied."
72,page_72,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protocol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 72 3. Misuse : Situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with the authoriz ed product information. 4. Abuse: Persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of medicinal products which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects. 5. Off-label use: Situations where a medicinal produc t is intentionally used for a medical purpose not in accordance with the authorized product information. 6. Occupational exposure : Exposure to a medicinal product, as a result of one’s professional or non-professional occupation. 7.4. Clinical Laboratory Tests All clinical laboratory test results outside of the reference range will be judged by the investigator as belonging to one of the following categories: • abnormal and not clinically signif icant • abnormal and clinically signif icant A laboratory test result that h as significantly worsened (according to investigator's medical judgment) from the baseline result will be recorded on the source documentation and should be repeated. An adverse investigational event includes a laboratory or diagnostic test abnormality (once confirmed by repeat testing) that results in the withdrawal of the patient from the study, the temporary or permanent cessation of treatment with study drug, or medical treatment or further diagnostic work-up. Any adverse clinical laboratory result should be monitored as described in Section 7.1.2. See Section 7.1.1 for a description of laboratory results that will be reported as adverse events. 7.4.1. Serum Chemistry, Hemat ology, and Urinalysis Clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis) will be performed at the time points detailed in Table 2. Clinical laboratory tests will be performed using the local laboratory . Specific laboratory tests to be performed are provided in Table 4 ."

Human Chorionic Gonadotropin Tests Human chorionic gonadotropin tests in serum will be performed for all women at screening (visit 1) and, in urine, before study drug administration and before each PET/CT scan as specified in Table 2. Any female patient who becomes pregnant during the study will be withdrawn . Procedures for reporting the pregnancy are provided in Section 7.2. 7.5. Vital Signs Vital signs ( blood pressure, respiratory rate, body temperature, pulse, and SpO 2) will be measured at the time points detailed in Table 2. All vital signs results outside of the reference range s will be judged by the investigato r as belonging to one of the following categories:"
74,page_74,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protocol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 74 • abnormal and not clinically significant • abnormal and clinically significant Before blood pressure and pulse are measured, the patient must be in a supine or semi -erect/seated position and resting for at l east 5 minutes . The same position and arm should be used each time vital signs ar e measured for a given patient. For any abnormal vital sign finding, the measurement should be repeated as soon as possible. Any vital sign value that is judged by the investi gator as clinically significant will be recorded on the source documentation, transcribed to the CRF as an adverse event, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2. 7.6. Electrocardiography A 12 -lead ECG will be c onducted at screening (visit 1) . ECGs should be obtained before other assessments (eg, blood draw and pulmonary function testing). T he ECG will be interpreted by the investigator (or qualified physician) as normal or abnormal. If the ECG is read as abnormal the investigator will specify the abnormality and indicate whether or not the abnormality is clinically significant (yes or no). Clinically significant abnormal ECG findings at screening should be recorded as part of the medical history. 7.7. Physical Examinati ons Physical examinations, including height (to be obtained at the screening visit only) and weight, will be performed at the time points detailed in Table 2. The “full” physical examination should include the following organ systems: General appearance; Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, and Throat; Chest and Lung; Heart; Abdomen; Musculoskeletal; Skin; Lymph Nodes; and Neurological. The “brief” physical examination should include at minimum the following organ systems: Genera l appearance; Head, Eyes, Ears, Nose, and Throat; Chest and Lung; and Heart. Any physical examination finding that is judged by the investigator as clinically signif icant will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the CRF, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2. 7.8. Concomitant Medication or Treatment Use of concomitant medication or treatment will be monitored throughout the study. Details of prohibited medications are found in Section 5.3. 7.9. Methods and Time Points of Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Data All adverse events will be reviewed on a periodic basis by the medical monitor according to the safety monitoring plan (eg, scheduled safety reviews for reslizumab) as interim/preliminary safety databases become available. In addition, s afety data will be evaluated periodically and ad hoc (if necessary) by the Teva Product Safety Group. Procedures for recording safety data are discussed in Section 13.1 and methods of analyses are discussed in Section 9.7.2."

Assessment of Exploratory Biomarkers 8.1.1. Immunoglobulin E 8.1.1.1. Background Immun oglobulin (IgE) is synthesiz ed by plasma cells as an immune reaction to parasites such as helminths ( Erb 2007). IgE also has an essential role in type I hypersensitivity, which manifests various allergic diseases, such as al lergic asthma, most types of sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, food allergies, and specific types of chronic urticaria and atopic dermatitis ( Gould et al 2003). Immunoglobulin E also plays a pivotal role in responses to allergens, such as anaphylatic drugs, bee stings, and antigen preparations used in desensitization immunotherapy. It is well known that IgE, T- helper cell subset 2 ( Th2)- derived cytokines , and eosinophils play a major role in the development of chronic airway inflammation, which is observed even in subjects with mild disease ( Busse 2000, Hollowa y et al 2001, Novak and Bieber 2003, Pelaia et al 2012). Airway inflammation plays a central role in the pathogenesis of bronchial asthma and is associated with an increase in airway responsiveness to several trigger factors such as aeroallergens which induce bronchoconstriction in atopic asthma patients, acting sometimes in cooperation with other trigger factors such as viruses and air pollution ( Martinez and Vercelli 2013). It is estimated that more than 50% of asthma has an allergic background and about 50% of patients with severe asthma have allergic- atopic asthma ( Masoli et al 2 004, Wenzel 2006), although many previously published data demonstrated that the severe phenotype is less frequent in atopic adult- onset asthma ( Wenzel 2006, E NFUMOSA 2003, Moore et al 2007). The development of the first anti- IgE antibody has been a significant advance in the treatment of allergic asthma. In 2005, Humbert and colleagues examined the benefits of omalizumab (anti-IgE, Xolair ®) as add -on therapy in patients with severe persistent asthma who are inadequately con trolled despite best available therapy ( Humbert et al 2005). The INNOVATE trial reported that the rate of clinically significant asthma exacerbations, after adjusting for an observed imbalance in asthma exacerbation history prior to randomization, was significantly reduced by 26.2% with omalizumab versus placebo. Overall, there are many therapeutic benefits of anti -IgE antibodies. These include serum IgE levels diminishing by greater than 95% compared to before treatment and consequently weakening early and late phase reactions ( Fahy et al 1997, Milgrom et al 1999). The 2014 Cochrane review (Normansell et al 2014) and other systematic reviews identify that omalizu mab significantly reduces asthma exacerbations, and specifically that there was a reduction in the rate of exacerbations from 26% to 16% when comparing patients given a placebo to patients receiving omalizumab ( Norman et al 2 013, O’Byrne 2013). Despite all these advances, the effect of anti -IL5 therapy on the levels of IgE has never been studied. In this protocol, we wish to evaluate the quantity of IgE in peripheral blood and sputum and determine whether any changes occur f ollowing the administration of r eslizumab."

Specimen Sampling and Handling Blood samples for assessment of IgE will be collected and processed using the procedures in place at the investigational center 8.1.2. Dipeptidyl Peptidase -4 8.1.2.1. Background The protein encoded by the dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 (DPP4) gene is an antigenic enzyme expressed on the surface of most cell types and is associated with immune regulation, signal transduction and apoptosis ( Chen 2006). The best known immunostimulatory activity of DPP4 is its contribution to T lymphocyte activation ( Zhong et al 2013). Recently, it was reported that DPP4 has a proliferative effect on vascular smooth muscle cells ( Ervinna et al 2013) and could be involved in airway remodeling by inducing the production of extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin ( Shiobara et al 2016). Although DPP4 has recently been demonstrated to be induced by IL-13 in normal human bronchial epithelial cells ( Zhen et al 2007), the contribution of IL-5 is currently unknown and the effect of anti -IL-5 therapy on the expression of DPP4 has never been studied. In this protocol, we wish to evaluate levels of DPP4 in peripheral blood and sputum and determine whether any changes occur following the administration of reslizumab. 8.1.2.2. Specimen Sampling and Handling Blood samples for assessment of DPP4 will be collected and processed using the procedures in place at the investigational center 8.1.3. 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D 8.1.3.1. Background The relationship between low levels of vitamin D and declining lung function has been demonstrated in a number of clinical trials, observational studies and real-world evidence data (Poon et al 2013, Brumpton et al 2016). Black and Scragg evaluated data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examinations Survey, which conducted a cross- sectional 6-year study on 14,091 participants. Eligible subjects had undergone spirometry and a measurement of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D level. After adjustment for age, gender, height, body mass index, ethnicity, and smoking history, they observed a significant di fference in mean FEV 1 and mean FVC among participants with the highest quintile of serum 25- hydroxy vitamin D level (≥85.7 nmol/L) compared with the lowest quintile (≤40.4 nmol/L; p < 0.0001) ( Black and Scragg 2005). The HUNT study reported on the association between low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and lung function decline in adults with asthma and whether this association was modified by smoking status or ICS use in a period spanning 11 years. Participants with low 25- hydrox yvitamin D (<50 nmol/L) had more decline in the lung function measurements of FEV 1 and FVC when compared"
77,page_77,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protocol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 77 with those with high 25- hydroxyvitamin D (≥50 nmol/L). The associations were stronger in never smokers and non- ICS users (Brumpton et al 2016). Mechanistically, the beneficial effects of vitamin D on asthma can be proposed through several pathways. T-helper type 9 lymphocytes play an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma. Vitamin D can decrease inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin ( IL)-9, IL -5, and IL-13 in these cells ( Keating et al 2014 ). Steroid resistance is a major challenge in the treatment of asthma and vitamin D can overcome this resistance by generating IL -10-secreting regulatory T cells (Xystrakis et al 2006) and down- regulating th e expression of fractalkine, a gene causing steroid resistance ( Banerjee et al 2008 ). Even a combination of vitamin D and dexamethasone were more effective in decreasing the inflammatory cytokines than dexamethasone alone ( Keating et al 2014, Chambers et al 2015). Interestingly, patients with glucocorticoid -resistant asthma were should to have significantly reduced levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and elevated levels of vitamin D -binding protein ( VDBP) raising the possibility that serum VDBP may be a useful noninvasive biomarker to predict steroid resistance in asthma patients ( Jiang et al 2016). As more evidence accumulates linking 25 -hydroxyvitamin D to glucocortic oid resistance in asthma, little is know n of the effects of an anti -IL5 therapy on the levels of 25- hydroxyvitamin D. In this protocol, we wish to evaluate levels of vitamin D in peripheral blood and sputum and determine whether any changes occur following the administration of reslizumab . 8.1.3.2. Specimen Sampling and Handling Blood samples for assessment of 25-hydroxy vitamin D will be collected and processed using the procedures in place at the investigational center 8.1.4. Eotaxin-1, -2, and -3 8.1.4.1. Background Eotaxin -1 (also known as CCL11) is a small cytokine belonging to the CC chemokine family. Eotaxin -1 selectively recruits eosinophils by inducing their chemotaxis, and, therefore, is implicated in allergic responses ( Jose et al 1994; Ponath et al 1996; Garcia- Zepeda et al 1996 a). Increased expression of eotaxin in bronchoalveolar lavage and airways of asthmatics contributes to the chemotaxis of eosinophils to the site of inflammation ( Lamkhioued et al 1997). Eotaxin-2 (CCL24) also belongs to the CC chemokine family and elevated levels of eotaxin-2 have been seen in patients with aspirin -exacerbated respiratory disease, such as asthma ( Palikhe et al 20 10). Lastly, eotaxin -3 (CCL26) is chemotactic for eosinophils and basophils and is expressed by several tissues including heart, lung and ovary, and in endothelial cells that have been stimulated with the cytokine IL-4 ( Shinkai et al 1999; Guo et al 1999). Eosinophilia in lung tissue is driven by IL-5, which supports the development of eosinophils in the bone marrow, and by the recruitment of eosinophils to the lung mucosa and interstitium via production of eotactic chemokines such as eotaxins 1, 2 and 3 (CCL11, CCL24 and CCL26, respectively) ( Lambrecht and Hamad 2015 ). In animal models, an iv injection of IL-5 in guinea pigs induces an acute increase in circulating eo sinophils, and this amplifies tissue recruitment induced by locally administered eotaxin ( Conroy and Williams 2001)."
78,page_78,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protocol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 78 Although the role of the eotaxin family has been demonstrated as a chemotactic agent for eosinophils, the e ffect of anti -IL5 therapy on the expression of these eotaxins has never been studied. In this protocol, we wish to evaluate levels of eotaxins-1, -2, and -3 in peripheral blood and sputum and determine whether any changes occur following the administration of reslizumab. 8.1.4.2. Specimen Sampling and Handling Blood samples for assessment of eotaxin-1, -2, and - 3 will be collected and processed using the procedures in place at the investigational center 8.1.5. Thymus and Activation Regulated Chemokine 8.1.5.1. Background Thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC), also known as CCL17, is a small cytokine belonging to the CC chemokine family. TARC specifically binds and induces chemotaxis in T-cells, specifically Th2 -type, and elicits its effects by intera cting with the chemokine receptor CCR4 ( Imai et al 1996, Imai et al 1997). It is expressed in dendritic cells and possibly in macrophages. In 2001, Kawasaki and colleagues demonstrated that TARC was constitutively expressed in the lung and was up- regulated in allergic inflammation. A specific an tibody against TARC attenuated ovalbumin-induced airway eosinophilia and diminished the degree of airway hyperresponsiveness with a concomitant decrease in Th2 cytokine levels and eosinophil-chemotactic chemokine expression in the lung ( Kawasaki et al 2001 ). Despite these advances, the in vivo pathophysiological roles of TARC remain largely unknown and the effect of anti -IL-5 therapy on the expression of TARC has never been studied. In this protocol, we wish to evaluate levels of TARC in peripheral blood and sputum and determine whether any changes occur following the administration of reslizumab. 8.1.5.2. Specimen Sampling and Handling Blood samples for assessmen t of TARC will be collected and processed using the procedures in place at the investigational center 8.1.6. Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 and -4 8.1.6.1. Background Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and 4 (MCP-4) are also known as CCL2 and CCL13, respectively, and belong to the CC chemokine family. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, RANTES, MCP-3, and eotaxin have been shown to be increased in the epithelium and bronchial mucosa in patients with asthma compared with normal control subj ects ( Sousa et al 1994, Humbert et al 1997). Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 is also increased in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids from patients with asthma ( Lamkhioued et al 1997, Rozyk et al 1997) and is released into the BAL fluid following endobronchial antigen challenge of patients with allergic asthma ( Holgate et al 1997 )."
79,page_79,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protocol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 79 MCP -4 has been shown to be expressed in a limited number of human disease tissue. We have found that MCP-4 mRNA is expressed in the epithelium and submucosa of nasal biopsies obtained from patients with both allergic and nonallergic sinusitis and allergic rhinitis (Garcia-Zepeda et al 1996b, M endez -Enriquez and Garcia -Zepada 2013, Kalayci et al 2004 ). MCP -4 is broadly active on immune cells implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma. The levels of MCP -4 protein in the BAL correlate with eosinophil influx. MCP-4 plays a role in the recruitment and activati on of eosinophils in the airway of patients with asthma and thus the pathogenesis of this disease. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and MCP- 4 have demonstrated as a chemotactic agent for eosinophils, however the effect of anti- IL-5 therapy on the expression of these chemokines has never been studied. In this protocol, we wish to evaluate levels of MCP-1 and MCP-4 in peripheral blood and sputum and determine whether any changes occur following the administration of reslizumab. 8.1.6.2. Specimen Sampling and Handling Blood samples for assessment of MCP-1 and MCP-4 will be collected and processed using the procedures in place at the investigational center 8.1.7. Type 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells 8.1.7.1. Background Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are a relatively novel family of haematopoietic effector cells which, like traditional Th2 cells, produce Th2-associated cytokines, including high amounts of IL -5 and IL-13 and, to a lesser extent, IL -4 (Walker et al 2013, Spits et al 2013). Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of ILC2s in nasal polyps of chronic rhinosinusitis, which are characterized by large numbers of eosinophils ( Mjösberg et al 2011) as well as in lung and peripheral blood of pa tients with asthma ( Begin and Nadeau 2014 ). In a subset of patients with severe asthma, increased expression of epithelial- derived IL25, IL33 and thy mic stromal lymphopoietin drives activation of ILC2s which, in turn, contributes to refractory eosino philia ( Licona -Limon et al 2013, Halim et al 2012 ). In addition, ILC2s may influence the polarization and activation of Th2 cells by their ability absorb and display antigens via MHC II presentatio n (Scanlon and McKenzie 2015). The effect of anti -IL-5 therapy on the presence, distribution and/or activation of ILC2s in patients with eosinophilic asthma has never been studied. In this protocol, we wish to evaluate the number of ILC2 cells in peripheral blood and sputum by flow cytometry and determine whether any changes occur following the administration of r eslizumab. 8.1.7.2. Specimen Sampling and Handling Blood samples for assessment of ILC2s will be collected and processed u sing the procedures in place at the investigational center 8.1.8.

Blood Sampling and Handling Blood samples (5 mL) for assessment of ADA response will be taken before and after dosing at the time points indicated in Table 2. Unscheduled blood samples for anti-reslizumab antibody assessment will also be obtained from all patients experiencing a severe hypersensitivity reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) . Samples will be collected into labeled serum separator tubes and inverted slowly at least 5 times to thoroughly mix the blood with the clotting activation agent. Labels for samples should include study number, patient number, period, and nominal collection time. Blood samples will be left standing upright at room temperature (20°C to 25°C) to clot for approximately 30-60 minutes. Samples should then be centrifuged at a minimum of 1500 g for approximately 10 minutes at 4°C until clot and serum are well separated. Samples may be centrifuged at ambient temperature at 1500 g for 10 minutes as long as measures are taken as appropriate to prevent samples from heating significantly during centrifugation. Separated serum will be transferred, in approximately equal portions, into 2 labeled cryovial tubes (primary aliquot A and back- up aliquot B) and stored in an ultralow freezer at ≤ -65°C until shipped to a central or bioanalytical laboratory with temperature monitoring. Sample labels should include patient number, study number, collection date, and indication that it is an ADA sample aliquot (A or B). Storage at -15 to -20°C is acceptable for a period of up to 1 month if a ≤-65°C freezer is not available. The listed temperatures must be maintained. The actual times and dates of samp ling will be recorded on the CRF. 8.2.2. Shipment and Analysis of Samples Serum samples for immunogenicity assessment for all patients will be stored until shipped to the sponsor or its designee for analysis. Samples will be stored in an upright position at ≤ –65ºC until assayed. The central laboratory will be notified before the shipment of the samples and will be sent the shipping information when the samples are shipped. Set A samples will be transported with a temperature data logger and frozen with sufficient dry ice by next -day courier to the central laboratory. Set B samples will either be sent to the same laboratory as that for set A on a later day by next - day courier, or be retained at the investigational center until the study is completed (unless shipment to another facility is requested by the sponsor). Samples from reslizumab -treated patients will be analyzed using appropriate validated methods. Timing of the initiation of sample analysis will be determined by the Teva Pharmaceuticals bioanalytical depar tment representative responsible for the bioanalysis. The bioanalytical team will not be blinded for this analysis.

Protocol Violations Any deviation from the protocol that affects, to a significant degree, (a) the safety, physical , or mental integrity of the subjects of the study and/or (b) the scientific value of the study will be considered a protocol violation. Protocol violations may include non- adherence on the part of the patient, the investigator, or the sponsor to protocol- specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, primary objective variable criteria, or GCP guidelines; noncompliance to study drug administration; use of prohibited medications. Protocol violations will be identified and recorded by investigational center personnel in the CRF. All protocol violations will be reported to the responsible IEC/IRB, as required. When a protocol violation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to discontinue the patient from the study or permit the patient to continue in the study, with documented approval from the medical expert . The decision will be based on ensuring the safety of the patient and preserving the integrity of the study. Changes in the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the protocol are not prospectively granted by the sponsor. If investigational center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria was entered in a study, they must immediately inform the sponsor of the protocol violation. If such patient has already completed the study or has withdrawn early, no action will be taken but the violation will be recorded. 11.2.

Study Monitoring To ensure compliance with GCP guidelines, the study monitor or representative is responsible for ensuring that patients have signed the informed consent form and the study is conducted according to applicable SOPs, the protocol, and other written instructions and regulatory guidelines. The study monitor is the primary association between the sponsor and the investigator . The main responsi bilities of the study monitor are to visit the investigator before, during, and after the study to ensure adherence to the protocol, that all data are correctly and completely recorded and reported, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded for all patients before they participate in the study and when changes to the consent form are warranted, in acc ordance with IEC/IRB approvals. The study monitor will contact the investigator and visit the investigational center at regular intervals throughout the study. The study monitor will be permitted to check and verify the various records (CRFs and other pertinent source data records, including specific electronic source document [see Section 3.13]) relating to the study to verify adherence to the protocol and to ensure the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data being recorded . If electronic CRFs are used for the study, the study monitor will indicate verification by electronically applying source document verification flags to the CRF and will ensure that all required electronic signatures are being impl emented accordingly. As part of the supervision of study progress, other sponsor personnel may, on request, accompany the study monitor on visits to the investigational center . The investigator and assisting personnel must agree to cooperate with the study monitor to resolve any problems, errors, or possible misunderstandings concerning the findings detected in the course of these monitoring visits or provided in follow- up written communication. 11.4. Clinical Product Complaints A clinical product complaint is defined as a problem or potential problem with the physical, chemical, micro -biological quality, or characteristics of clinical drug supplies or clinical device supplies used in a clinical research study sponsored by Teva. Examples of a product quality- related complaint include but are not limited to: • suspected contamination • questionable stability (eg, color change, flaking, crumbling, etc) • defective components • missing or extra units (eg, primary container is received at the investigational center with more o r less than the designated number of units inside) • incorrect packaging , or incorrect or missing labeling/labels • unexpected or unanticipated taste or odor, or both"
89,page_89,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protocol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 89 • device not working correctly or appears defective in some manner Each investigational center will be responsible for reporting a possible clinical product quality related complaint by completing the product quality complaint f orm provided by Teva and emailing it to within 2 business days of becoming aware of the issue. For complaints involving a device or other retrievable item, it is required that the device (or item) be sent back to Teva for investigative evaluation whenever possible. For complaints involving a drug product, all relevant sample s (eg, the remainder of the patient’s drug supply) should be sent back to Teva for investigative evaluation whenever possible. 11.4.1. Product Quality Related Complaint Information Needed from the Investigational Center In the event that the product quality c omplaint f orm can not be completed, the investigator will obtain the following information, as available: • investigational center number and principal investigator name • name, phone number, and address of the source of the complaint • clinical protocol number • patient identifier (patient study number) and corresponding visit numbers, if applicable • product name, lot number, and strength for open- label studies • patient number, bottle, and kit numbers (if applicable) for double-blind or open- label studies • product available for return Y es/No • product was taken or used according to protocol Y es/No • description or nature of complaint • associated adverse event Yes/No • clinical supplies unblinded (for blinded studies) Y es/No • date and name (clinical study site) of person receiving the complaint Note: Reporting a product quality related complaint must not be delayed even if not all the required information can be obtained immediately . Known information must be reported immediately . The sponsor will collaborate with the investigator to subsequentl y obtain any outstanding information. 11.4.2. Handling of Study Drug at the Investigational Center The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from the investigator’s clinical study supplies. The sponsor may request that the investigator return the product for further evaluation and/ or analysis. If this is necessary, the clinical study monitor or designee will provide the information needed for returning the study drug."
90,page_90,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protocol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 90 If it is determined that the investigational ce nter must return all study drug, the sponsor will provide the information needed to handle the return. The integrity of the randomization code and corresponding blinded clinical supplies will be maintained whenever possible. A serious adverse event or the potential for a product quality problem existing beyond the scope of the complaint may be a reason to unblind the clinical supplies for an affected patient. 11.4.3. Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint If there is an adverse event or serious adverse event due to product complaint, the protocol should be followed for recording and reporting ( Section 7.1.2 and Section 7.1.5.3, respectively) . 11.4.4. Documenting a P roduct Complaint The investigator will record in the source documentation a description of the product complaint, and any actions taken to resolve the complaint and to preserve the safety of the patient . Once the complaint has been investigated by the sponsor and the investigator, if necessary, a n event closure letter may be sent to the investigational center where the complaint originated or to all investigational centers using the product. 11.5. Audit and Inspection The sponsor may audit the investigational center to evaluate study conduct and compliance with protocols, SOPs, GCP guidelines, and applicable regulatory requirements. The sponsor’s Global Clinical Quality Assurance, independent of Global Clinical Development, is responsible for determining the need for (and timing of) an investigational center audit. The investigator must accept that competent authorities and sponsor representatives may conduct inspections and audits to verify compliance with GCP guidelines."

ETHICS Details of compliance with regulato ry requirements and applicable laws are provided in Section 1.6. 12.1. Informed Consent The investigator, or a qualified person designated by the investigator, should fully inform the patient of all pertinent aspects o f the study, including the written information approved by the IEC/IRB . All written and oral information about the study will be provided in a language as nontechnical as practical to be understood by the patient. The patient should be given ample time and opportunity to inquire about details of the study and to decide whether or not to participate in the study. The above should be detailed in the source documents. Written informed consent will be obtained from each patient before any study- specific procedures or assessments are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards are explained, according to the IEC/IRB requirements. The patient’s willingness to participate in the study will be documented in the informed consent form, which will be signed and personally dated by the patient and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion. The investigator will keep the original informed consent forms, and copies will be given to the patients . It will also be explained to the patients that the patient is free to refuse participation in the study and free to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to future treatment. Patients will provide written informed consent prior to completing the PET/CT scans . 12.2. Compet ent Authorities and Independent Ethics Committees/Institutional Review Boards Before this study starts, the protocol will be submitted to each IEC/IRB for review. As required, the study will not start before the IEC/IRB for the investigational center gives written approval or a favorable opinion. 12.3. Confidentiality Regarding Study Patients The investigator must ensure that the privacy of the patients, including their identity and all personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. In CRFs and other documents or image material submitted to the sponsor, patients will be identified not by their names, but by an identification number. Personal medical information may be reviewed for the purpose of patient safety or for verifying data in the source an d transcribed to the CRF. This review may be conducted by the study monitor, properly authorized persons on behalf of the sponsor, Global Q uality A ssurance, or competent authorities . Personal medical information will always be treated as confidential. 12.4. Decl aration of the End of Clinical Study The last visit (visit 7) is defined as end of treatment (approximately week 6).

Data Collection Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically designed for this study. The data collected on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management system (CDMS) that meets the technical requirements described in 21CFR Part 11. The CDMS will be fully validated to ens ure that it meets the scientific, regulatory, and logistical requirements of the study before it is used to capture data from this study. Before using the CDMS, all users will receive training on the system and study- specific training. After they are train ed, users will be provided with individual system access rights. Data will be collected at the investigational center by appropriately designated and trained personnel, and CRFs must be completed for each patient who provided informed consent. Patient identity should not be discernible from the data provided on the CRF. Data will be verified by the study monitor using the data source, and reviewed for consistency by Data Management using both automated logical checks and manual review. All data collected wi ll be approved by the investigator at the investigational center . This approval acknowledges the investigator’s review and acceptance of the data as being complete and accurate. If data are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanalytical laboratory, central image center, electronic diary data, electronic patient-reported outcome Tablet ), the results will be sent to the investigational center , where they will be retained but not entered in the CRF, unless otherwise specified in the protocol. These data may also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing data management) for direct entry in the clinical database. Laboratory test results will not be entered in the CRF unless otherwise specified in the protocol. All data from other sources will be available to the investigator s. For patients who enter a study but do not meet entry criteria, at a minimum, data for screen ing failure reason, demography, and adverse events from the time of informed consent will be entered in the CRF . 13.2. Data Quality C ontrol Data Management is responsible for the accuracy, quality, completeness, and internal consistency of the data from this study. Data handling, including data quality control, will comply with international regulatory guidelines, including ICH GCP guidelines. Data management and control processes specific to this study, along with all steps and actions taken regarding data management and data quality contr ol, will be described in a data management plan. Case report forms received will be processed and reviewed for completeness, consistency, and the presence of mandatory values . Applicable terms will be coded according to the coding conventions for this study . Logical checks will be implemented to ensure data quality and accuracy . Any necessary changes will be made in the clinical database, and data review and validation procedures will be repeated as needed . Data from external sources will be compared with the information available in the CDMS. Discrepancies found will be queried."
94,page_94,"Placebo -Controlled Study– Asthma with Eosinophilia Clinical Study Protocol Study CEP38072- AS-40105 94 Data corrections in the CDMS will be made using the CDMS update function. The system requires a reason for each change and keeps a complete audit trail of the data values, dates , and times of modifications, and authorized electronic approvals of the change s. At the conclusion of the study, the CDMS and all other study data will be locked to further additions or corrections. Locking the study data represents the acknowledgement that all data have been captured and confirmed as accurate. 13.3. Archiving of Case Rep ort Forms and Source Documents 13.3.1. Sponsor Responsibilities The sponsor will have final responsibility for the processing and quality control of the data. Data management oversight will be carried out as described in the sponsor’s SOPs for clinical studies. Day to day data management tasks for this study are delegated to a contract organization, and these functions may be carried out as described in the SOPs for clinical studies at that organization. These SOPs will be reviewed by the sponsor before the start of data management activities . The original CRFs will be archived by the sponsor. Investigational c enter -specific CRFs will be provided to the respective investigational center s for archiving. 13.3.2. Investigator Responsibilities The investigator must maintain all written and electronic records, accounts, notes, reports, and data related to the study and any additional records required to be maintained under country, state/province, or national and local laws, including, but not limited to : • full case histories • signed informed consent forms • patient identification lists • case report forms for each patient on a per- visit basis • data from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanalytical laboratory, central image center, electronic diary) • safety reports • financial discl osure reports/forms • reports of receipt, use, and disposition of the study drug • copies of all correspondence with sponsor, the IEC /IRB , and any competent authority The investigator will retain all records related to the study and any additional records required , as indicated by the protocol and according to applicable laws and regulations, until the CRO or sponsor notifies the institution in writing that records may be destroyed. If, after 25 years from study completion, or earlier in the case of the investi gational center closing or going out of business, the investigator reasonably determines that study record retention has become unduly burdensome, and sponsor has not provided written notification of destruction, then the investigator may submit a written request to sponsor at least 60 days before any planned disposition of study records. After receipt of such request, the sponsor may make arrangements"
