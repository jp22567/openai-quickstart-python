Therefore, a major update included in this amendment is to change the estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate criterion for participant exclusion from a cut -off of <50 mL/min/1.73 m2to cut -off of <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Participants with an eGFR of ≥30mL/min/1.73 m2 and <50 mL/min/1.73 m2at Visit 1 with unstable renal function (defined as a ≥50% increase of serum creatinine compared to a value obtained at least 6 months prior to Visit 1 ) are also excluded . Clarifications of certain sections and procedur es, as detailed below, were also made in the protocol during the creation of this amendment. Summary of Changes Table: Section # and Name Description of Change Brief Rationale 1.3 –Schedule of Activities Removed explanatory text in the notes column.Explanatory text is found in the protocol body and is now cross -referenced in the Schedule of Activities. Added row for contact to participant enrollment center.For reference Added weight measurements to be conducted at Visit 3and Visit 6.Included additional visits for weight measures to better assess any changes in weight throughout the trial. Added specialized urine collection for crystal assay to be performed at Visits 5, 6, 8, and discontinuation. This assessment was included to highlight the visits where specialized urine collection is required . 050YZQ 05PZB6"

Exclusion #1 8was updated to include text indicating that laboratory assessments can be repeated once at the investigator’s discretion.To provide more flexibility during the screening process. 5.3.2 –Caffeine, Alcohol, and Tobacco RestrictionsAdded text specify ing that smoking of any kind is not permitted during the study . Examples of smoking are provided. To better clarify that all tobacco and non - tobacco smoking items are not permitted during the s tudy. 6.8 –Clinical Supplies Disclosure Added cross reference for unblinding a participant during the studyFor reference . 8.1.2 –Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Added the instruction for source documentation regarding eGFR criterion.The source documentation of stable serum creatinine must be retained to enroll the participant with eGFR ≥30 mL /min/1.73 m2and <50 mL /min/1.73 m2at Visit 1 with stable renal function. 050YZQ 05PZB6"

The importance of cough as a clinical problem globally h as led to multiple societies publishing guidelines on the diagnosis and management of cough [Morice, A. H., et al 2004] [I rwin, R. S., et al 2006] [Morice, A. H., et al 2006] [The com mittee for The Japanese Respiratory Society guidelines 2006] [Kardos, P., et al 2010] . In these clinical guidelines, including Japan, cough is categorized based upon the duration of the cough; within each category (acute, subacute, and chronic) are likely diagnostic possibilities [Irwin, R. S., et al 2006] . Acute cough is present for less than 3 weeks and most often due to acute viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). A cough that has been present longer than 3 weeks is either sub -acute (3 to 8 weeks) or chronic (> 8 weeks). It is reported in Japan that the prevalence of the chronic cough may affect up to approximately 2% of the adult population and the most common underly ing condition is asthma/cough -variant asthma followed b y sinobronchial syndrome, atopic cough, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and postinfections [Fujimura, M. 2012] . Most of the patients with cough could be effectivel y managed by optimizing therap y for the underl ying condition. However, a minority of patients with a potential co -morbid condition cannot be effectivel y managed b y optimizing therap y for the condition and are considered to have refractory chronic cough. Also, the cause of chronic cough remains unexplained in 5% to 10% of patients seeking medical attention specific to their cough [Gibson, P., et al 2016] . This protocol aims to study participants with either refractory chronic cough or unexplained chronic cough. Professional guidelines describe s ystematic approaches to the evaluation and management of chronic cough. These guidelines are based largel y on consensus opinion and observational data from the medical literature. There are currently no treatments approved by Japan Ministry ofHealth, Labour and Welfare , the United States Food and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency for the treatment of chronic cough. Given the prolonged nature, significant morbidit y, and the lack of effective treatment, refractory or unexplained chronic cough is a major unmet medical need. Mechanism of Cough Each cough occurs through the stimulation of a complex reflex arc. Cough is initiated following activation of airway sensory nerves in t he upper and lower respiratory tract. Airway sensory nerves are tailored to detect changes in the phy sical and chemical environment, and if required elicit protective reflex events such as cough. These reflexes are normally protective, however, in disease, airway reflexes can become h yper-responsive , leading to an increase in sy mptoms and a pathologic cough. P2X3 receptors are ligand -gated ion channels that respond to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and are almost exclusively localized on C -fiber sensory neuro ns, which innervate the upper and lower airway s and are the main nerve fibers responsible for cough. ATP is released b y 050YZQ 05PZB6"

The action of ATP at sensory neurons in the periphery and spinal cord contributes to neural excitability and may cause hy per- responsiveness through binding to P2X3 -containing receptors and stimulating of C -fiber neurons [North, R. A. 2004] [Khakh, B. S. 2006] . Antagonism of P2X3 -containing recep tors is predicted to normalize sensory neuron sensitivity , based on data from P2X3 knock -out mice and the effects of small interfering ribonucleic acid (RNA) knock -down and pharmacological antagonists [Barclay , J., et al 2002] [Cockay ne, D. A., et al 2000] [Souslova, V., et al 2000] .ATP and P2X3 -containing receptors have been shown to be involved in airway s sensitization and their involvement provides a rationale for P2X3 antagonism in the treatmen t of cough. Cough Hypersensitivity Syndrome Recently , the term cough hy persensitivity syndrome has been proposed to describe a group of patients with chronic cough and similar clinical characteristics [Chung, K. F. 2014] . These similar clinical characteristics include irritation in the throat or upper chest, cough triggered by stimuli that do not normally cause cough , increased cough sensitivity to inhaled stimuli, and cough parox ysms.A potential biologic explan ation for cough h ypersensitivity syndrome suggests an associated sensory neuropathy characterized by sensory nerve hy per- sensitization. Sensory nerves are susceptible to sensitization by neuroactive mediators and altered expression of ion channels which regulate sensory nerve excitability to many chemical stimuli. As described above, the action of ATP at sensory neurons may cause hyper-responsiveness through binding to P2X3 -containing receptors and contribute to the pathophy siology of patie nts with chronic cough. The data from Protocol 012 support the role ofP2X3 antagonism in the treatment of patients with refractory or unexplained chronic cough. 2.1 Study Rationale The purpose of this stud y is to evaluate the long-term safet y of MK -7264, an o rally available P2X3 antagonist, in adult Japanese participants, at least 20 years of age, who have either refractory or unexplained chronic cough. Current therapies for cough (narcotic, non -narcotic, and over -the-counter medications) have limited and/or u nproven efficacy and an undesirable side effect profile. There are currently no approved therapies for chronic cough. Previous Phase 2 studies have demonstrated dose -related efficacy and an acceptable safet y andtolerability for MK -7264 in non -Japanese adu lt participants with refractory and unexplained chronic cough (refer to the Investigator’s Brochure [IB]). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long -term safety of MK -7264 with regulatory required number of Japanese refractory or unexplained chroni c cough patients. 2.2 Background Refer to the IB for detailed nonclinical and clinical background information on MK -7264 . 050YZQ 05PZB6"

MK -7264 has also been evaluated in an extensive nonclinical program. MK- 7264 is an oral treatment provided as a film coated tablet. The MK -7264 tablets provided f or this study contain either MK- 7264 45 mgor 15 mg. The placebo tablets provided in this study are indistinguishable from the MK -7264 tablet , respectively , in appearance. The placebo tablets contain no MK- 7264, but contain the same inactive excipients as those included in the active tablets. Clinical Studies in Chronic Cough Patients 2.2.2 Two phase 3 studies (Protocol 027 and Protocol 030) are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of MK -7264 in adult participants with refractory or unexplained chronic co ugh. As for Japanese adult participants with refractory or unexplained chronic cough, a phase 2 study (Protocol 033) was conducted to evaluate the safet y and efficacy . This study has been completed and the Clinical Study Report is not finalized. 2.3 Benefit/Ri sk Asse ssment It cannot be guaranteed that participants in clinical studies will directly benefit from treatment during participation, as clinical studies are designed to provide information about the safet y and effectiveness of an investigational medicine . MK- 7264 has been evaluated in an extensive nonclinical program. To date, there is little evidence from nonclinical studies that MK -7264 has an y direct cellular or direct target organ toxicity . In the completed and ongoing clinical studies, no major safet y concerns have been noted. Across studies, taste -related adverse events (AEs) were the most frequent reported AEs. The rationale for taste disturbance exists with P2X2/3 antagonism because of the putative participation of ATP, acting via this receptor, in transducing taste signals from taste buds cells to gustatory sensory nerves . The taste -related AEs are considered mechanism based non- serious adverse drug reactions and are expected for MK -7264. To date, they have been fully andrapidl y reversible after di scontinuation of the drug. Overall, based on growing clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of MK -7264 in participants with refractory or unexplained chronic cough described in the IB and the lack of significant safet y findings in completed and ongoing nonclinical and clinical studies, the benefit risk balance of MK -7264 is assessed as positive . Additional details regarding specific benefits and risks for participants participating in this clinical study may be found in the accompanyi ngIB and ICF docume nts. 050YZQ 05PZB6"

Approximately 160 participants who meet entry criteria will enter the study . The study duration for each participant is as follows: Screening Period: a minimum of 7 days and up to 14 days. For those who need to washout therapy , the washout starts after obtaining the informed consent and the screening period starts from the completion of washout. Baseline /Randomization : Day 1 Treatment period: 52 weeks Follow -up period: 14 days Individual participation is expected to be approximately 56 weeks from Screening through the Follow -up period. Specific procedures to be performed during the study , as well as their prescribed times and associated visit windows, are outlined in the SoA in Section 1.3. Details of each procedure are provided in Section 8. At study entry , participants will be randomiz ed in 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups: MK- 7264 45 mg twice daily (BID) orMK-7264 15 mg BID. Participants should remain on their assigned treatment throughout the stud y period . A safet y follow -up telephone contact will be conducted at a minimum of 1 4 day s (with an allowed variance of up to +7 day s) after last dose of study intervention. Please refer to details in Section 8.10.6. There will be one planned interim analysis when all the randomized participants have completed Week 24, or discontinued pri or to Week 24. The initial database lock (to support the interim anal ysis) and all safet y and efficacy analyses will be performed on the data up to Week 24. The sponsor will be unblinded at th ispoint in order to anal yze and report the data as the result will be used for the regulatory filing of MK -7264 in Japan. The study team responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the study will remain blinded to the treatment - level results of this interim analysis (safet y and efficacy). The final database lock will be conducted when all participants have completed or discontinued prior to the completion of study . 050YZQ 05PZB6"

To evaluate the safet y and tolerability profile of MK -7264 in Japanese adults, the safety and tolerability endpoints will be assessed b y clinical evaluation of adverse events and inspection of other stud y parameters including vital signs, physical examinat ion, and standard laboratory safety tests at time points specified in the SoA. Adverse events are graded and recorded according to S ection 8.4and Appendix 3. 4.2.1.2 Efficacy Endpoints An assessment of cough from the participant’s perspective is important for eva luating the response to therap y. Patient -reported outcomes (PRO s) associated with cough can be measured in terms of cough -specific quality of life, cough frequency , intensity , disruption due to cough ,cough severity and global rating of change in chronic c ough . The following cough related measures will be included in this study as secondary and exploratory endpoints : Secondary endpoint: Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) Exploratory endpoints: Cough Severit y Diary (CSD) and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI C) As validated PRO measures of cough -specific health -related qualit y of life (HRQoL) and cough severit y, data obtained from the LCQ, and CSD will provide important information relevant to the efficacy of MK -7264 in participants with refractory or unexplained chronic cough. In regards to the L CQ, a Japanese translated version of the LCQ has been validated for the use in Japanese chronic cough patients [Kanemitsu, Y., et al 2016] . There is experience in using the Japanese translated version of the CSD in the MK -7264 development program . The CSD will be linguistically validated. The impact of chronic cough on HRQoL as assessed by the LCQ is included as the secondary endp oint. The L CQ is a 19 -item cough -specific HRQoL questionnaire which contains three domains (phy sical, psy chological and social), calculated as a mean score for each domain ranging from 1 to 7 and total score ranging from 3 to 21. Each item on the LCQ asses ses symptoms or the impact of sy mptoms on HRQoL over the past two weeks using a 7 -point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 7. Higher scores indicate better HRQoL. Data obtained from 050YZQ 05PZB6"
26,page_26,"PRODUCT: MK-7264 26 PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.: 038-01 MK-7264 -038-01FINAL PROTOCOL 26-SEP-2018 the L CQ will provide information on the impact of chronic cough on patients’ d aily lives, beyond objective cough counts and severity , which is valuable information for assessing the full benefit of effective cough control. The minimally important change of LCQ was defined b ased on the study with 52 chronic cough patients [Raj, A. A., et al 2009] . Improvement of ≥1.3points was found to be predictive of patient -reported improvement on their cough- related s ymptoms, feelings as consequence of their cough, work or social life, and overall qual ity of life as rated on the Global Rating of Change Q uestionnaire s. The CSD is a 7 -item, disease -specific PRO measure completed daily in the evening, with a recall period of “today .” The measure evaluates frequency of cough (3 items), intensity of cough (2 items) and disruption (2 items); each item is rated on an 11 -point scale ranging from 0 to 10 with higher scores indicating greater severity. A CSD total score and 3 domain scores (frequency , intensit y, disruption) can be calculated. The PGI C is a single -item question asking the participant to rate the change in their chronic cough compared to the start of the stud y with response options ranging from “very much improved” to “very much worse” In addition to the above cough related PROs, EuroQoL 5 Version F ive Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ5D -5L)will be included in this study as exploratory endpoints to evaluate generic HRQo L: Exploratory endpoints: EuroQoL 5 Version Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ5D -5L) The EQ5D -5L is a standardized instrument for measurin g generic health status used for estimating preference weights for that health status. By combining the weight with time, quality -adjusted life y ears can be computed. The EQ5D -5L descriptive s ystem comprises the following 5 dimensions: mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety /depression. Each dimension has 5 levels and the participant will be asked to indicate their health state using a 5 -level rating scale. The EQ VAS records the participant’s self -rated health on vertical VAS whe re the endpoints are labeled “best imaginable health state” and “worst imaginable health state”. This information can be used as a quantative measure of health outcomes as judged by the individual participant. 4.2.1.3 Planned Exploratory Biomarker Research 4.2.1.3.1 Planne d Genetic Analysis Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to therap y, susceptibility to, severit y, and progression of disease. Variable response to therap y ma y be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabol ism, and excretion; mechanism of action of the drug; disease etiology; and/or molecular subtype of the disease being treated. Therefore, where local regulations and I RB/IEC allow, a sample will be collected for DNA anal ysis from consenting participants. 050YZQ 05PZB6"
27,page_27,"PRODUCT: MK-7264 27 PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.: 038-01 MK-7264 -038-01FINAL PROTOCOL 26-SEP-2018 DNA samples will be used for research related to the study intervention(s), the disease under study , and related diseases. They may also be used to develop tests/assay s including diagnostic tests related to the disease under study, related diseases, and stud y intervention(s). Genetic research may consist of the analy sis of 1 or more candidate genes or the anal ysis of genetic markers throughout the genome [or anal ysis of the entire genome] (as appropriate). DNA samples will be analy zed for variation across the entire genome. Analy ses may be conducted if it is hy pothesized that this may help furthe r understand the clinical data. The samples may be analy zed as part of a multi -study assessment of genetic factors involved in the response to understand study disease or related conditions. 4.2.1.4 Future Biomedical Research The Sponsor will conduct future biomedical research on DNA specimens for which consent was provided during this clinical study . Such research is for biomarker testing to address emergent questions not desc ribed elsewhere in the protocol (as part of the main study ) and will only be conducted on specimens from appropriatel y consented participants. The objective of collecting/retaining specimens for future biomedical research is to explore and identify biomark ers that inform the scientific understanding of diseases and/or their therapeutic treatments. The overarching goal is to use such information to develop safer, more effective drugs/vaccines, and/or to ensure that participants receive the correct dose of th e correct drug/vaccine at the correct time. The details of this future biomedical research substudy are presented in Appendix 6. Rationale for the Use of Comparator /Placebo 4.2.2 No comparator or placebo arm is included in this study . This study will be conducte d as double dummy study and as appearance of MK -7264 45 mg and 15 mg tablets are different, matching placebos are used to maintain blinding. 4.3 Justification for Dose Dose sfor This Study 4.3.1 The dose for this stud y will be either MK -7264 45mg BID or MK -7264 15 mg BID as determined b y the individual allocation per the assigned treatment group (see Section 6). The known mechanism of action of MK -7264 and related clinical study results support that the efficacy of MK -7264 in decreasing cough, and the prevalence of the most common AE, dysgeusia, are both dose related. In order to allow patients and prescribers appropriate flexibility based upon individual clinical needs, the MK -7264 development program has targeted two different doses to study in the Phase 3 program . 050YZQ 05PZB6"

Participants who are administered MK- 7264 (either 15 mg BID or 45 mg BID) will be exposed to MK -7264 for approximately 52 weeks. Rationale for Dose Interv al and Study Design 4.3.3 In this stud y, MK -7264 will be orally administered as MK -7264 45 mgBID or 15 mgBID based on the safet y and pharmacokinetic efficacy results observed to date (refer to the IB) . Based on pharmacokinetic studies, MK -7264 is rapidly absor bed with a median time to reach maximum plasma concentration (T max) of 1.0 to 2.0 hours. In addition, the half -life of MK- 7264 is approximately 7 to 10 hours and consistent with a BID dosing schedule. The duration of treatment is up to 1 y ear in order to provide a more robust assessment of the long-term safet y, tolerability and efficacy of MK -7264 in the treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough. 4.4 Beginning and End of Study Definition The overall study begins when the first participant signs the ICF. The overall study ends when the last participant completes the last study -related telephone -call or visit, withdraws from the study , or is lost to follow -up (ie, the participant is unable to be contacted b y the investigator). Clinical Criteria f orEarly Study Termination 4.4.1 There are no prespecified criteria for terminating the study early. 5 STUDY POPULATION Male/Female participants with chronic cough ≥ 4month sand a diagnosis of refractory or unexplained chronic cough at least 20yearsof age will be en rolled in this study .For the purposes of this study ,refractory chronic cough is defined as participants who have had a clinical evaluation that suggested a co -morbid condition that may be related to cough (eg, gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD], asth ma,or upper airway cough sy ndrome), the participant has received appropriate diagnostic workup and therap y according to the Japan ese Respiratory Societ y (JRS) guidelines, and the participant continues to cough despite being on therap y. Also inthis study , unexplained chronic cough is defined as participants who have had a clinical evaluation of their cough per JRS guidelines and this evaluation has not suggested a co -morbid condition that may be related to cough.

Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underly ing disease, unless judged b y the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. •All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2 , must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA . •If laboratory values from nonprotocol specified laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory require a change in study participant management or are considered clinically significant by the investigator (eg, SAE or AE or dose modification), then the results must be recorded in the appropriate CRF (eg, SL AB). •For an ylaboratory tests with values considered clinically significantl y abnormal during participation in the study or within 14days after the last dose of stud y intervention , every attempt should be made to perform repeat assessments until the values return to normal or baseline or if a new baseline is established as determined by the investigator . Renal and Urological Safety Procedures 8.3.7 Safety assessments will be performed in all participants in order to monitor renal and urological safet y during the course of the stud y. Participants will be monitored for hematuria using urinary dipstick (performed at the stud y site) and urinary crystals through urinaly sis (performed at the central laboratory ).Dipstick and urinaly ses (including microscop y performed at the centr al laboratory ) will be collected as outlined in the SoA. If during screening, a participant has cry stalluria and/or unexplained hematuria (defined as participants without a history of recent menses, urinary tract infection, or recent procedure/instrumenta tion that would explain the hematuria), the investigator should: Review and confirm if the finding is a new finding or a previousl y documented finding. Evaluate the participant’s medical history to identify conditions (ie, prior renal disease, prior histor y of kidney stones, medications, gastrointestinal conditions) and make a clinical determination if the participant is at high or low risk of potential complications/worsening due to an associated renal/urinary condition or its treatment, or requires a chan ge in therap y for that condition that may interfere with interpretation of safet y data collected during the study . 050YZQ 05PZB6"

If after randomization , the participant ha sconfirmed, unexplained hematuria and/or urinary crystals, an urine sample collected via a specialized filter will be shipped to Sponsor or designee and assessed for the presence of MK- 7264 urinary crystals via Raman spectroscop y. Raman spectroscop y is sensitive to the chemical structure of the molecule and MK- 7264 has unique chemical structure compared to common urin arycrystals. See vendor’s site manual for further procedural detai ls. If a participant ha sconfirmed MK -7264 urinary crystals, the Sponsor will inform the investigator and require discontinuation of the participant from study intervention with the recommendation to follow -up at approximately 2-week intervals with additio nal specialized urine anal ysisperformed until resolution of MK -7264 urinary crystals. 8.4 Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) ,and Other Reportable Safety Events The definitions of an AE or SAE, as well as the method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causalit y of AE and SAE and the procedures for completing and transmitting AE, SAE, and other reportable safety event reports can be found in Appendix 3. Adverse events, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be reported by the participant (or, w hen appropriate, b y a caregiver or surrogate ). The investigator, who is a qualifi ed ph ysician, is responsible for detecting, assessing, documenting, and reporting e vents that meet the definition of an AE or SAE, as well as other reportable safet y events. Investigators remain responsible for following up AE, SAEs, and other reportable safet y events for outcome according to Section 8.4.3. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable 8.4.1 Safety Event Information All AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events that occur after the consent form is signed but before treatment allocation/randomization must be reported b y the investigator if the partic ipant is receiving placebo run -in or other run -in treatment, if the event cause the participant to be excluded from the study , or is the result of a protocol -specified intervention, including but not limited to washout or discontinuation of usual therap y, diet, or a procedure. From the time of treatment allocation/randomization through last stud y-related intervention safet y follow -up phone call, all AEs, SAEs and other reportable safet y events must be reported b y the investigator; however, for those partici pants who discontinue from the study intervention but continue to be monitored, only the AEs and other reportable safety events that are shown in Table 3need to be reported. This specific approach for reporting 050YZQ 05PZB6"

Additionally , any SAE brought to the attention of an investigator at an y time outside of the time period specified in the previous parag raph must be reported immediately to the Sponsor if the event is considered drug -related. Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AE or SAE or other reportable safet y events in former stud y participants. However, if the investigator learns of an y SAE, including a death, at an y time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonabl y related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor. All ini tial and follow -up AEs, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or designee within the time frames as indicated in Table 3.

Method of Detecting AE s, SAE s,and Other Reportable Safety Events 8.4.2 Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and/or SAE and other reportable safet y events. Open -ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. Follow -up of AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable Safety Event Information 8.4.3 After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AE, SAE, and other reportable safet y events including pregnancy and exposure during breastfeeding, events of clinical interest (ECI), cancer, and overdose will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is otherwise e xplained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). In addition, the investigator will make every attempt to follow all nonserious AEs that occur in randomized participants for outcome. Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3. 050YZQ 05PZB6"

The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a stud y intervention under clinical investigation. All AEs will be reported to regulatory authorities, IRB/IECs, and investigators in accordance with all applicable global laws and regul ations (ie, per ICH Topic E6 (R2 ) Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice [GCP] ). Investigator safety reports must be prep ared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR s) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific safet y information (eg, summary or listing of SAE) from the Sponsor will file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements . Pregnancy and Exposure During Breastfeeding 8.4.5 Although pregnancy and infant exposure during breastfeeding are not considered AEs, an y pregnancy or infant exposure during breastfeeding in a participant (spontaneously reported to the investigator or their designee) that occurs during the stud y are reportable to the Sponsor. All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy . Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign h ydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage, and stillbirth mu st be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported. Disease -related Events and/or Disease -related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 8.4.6 AEs or SAEs There are no disease -related events and/or disease -related outcomes not qualify ing as AEs or SAEs. Events of Clinical Interest (ECI s) 8.4.7 Selected nonserious and SAEs are also known as ECIs and must be reported to the Sponsor. 050YZQ 05PZB6"

An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value t hat is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.* *Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional evaluation for an underl ying etiology. The study site guidance for assessment and follow -up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or equivalent). 8.5 Treatment of Overdose In this stud y, an overdose is any dose higher than the amount of study intervention taken outside the intervention assignment .Study intervention should be taken once in the morning and once in the evening. If more than the protocol -specified intervention is taken within a 1 day period (ie, > 2tablets /day from either bottle ),this is regarded as an overdose. No specific information is availabl e on the treatment of overdose. Oral doses of up to 1800 mg BID for 14 days were explored in earlier clinical studies without any untoward clinical effects (see MK -7264 IB). Overdose should be treated according to the participant ’s clinical signs and s ymptoms. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the Sponsor Clinical Director based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 8.6 Pharmacokinetics PK parameters will not be evaluated in this study . 8.7 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacod ynamic para meters will not be evaluated in this study . 8.8 Biomarkers Collection of samples for other biomarker research is also part of this study.

Specific procedure -related details are provided in Section 8. Pre-screen ing 8.10.1 Participants who require washout of any therapy (see Section 6.5) should start washout after the written informed consent is obtained. The procedures scheduled at V isit 1, for participants who require washout, should be started as soon as the washout completes. Screening period , for these participants, starts from the completion of the washout of required therapy. Screening 8.10.2 Approximately 2 weeks prior to treatment randomization, participants will be evaluated t o determine that they fulfill the entry requirements as set forth in Section 5. If any participant fails to meet the study entry criteria, s creening procedures may be repeated once based on investigator judgement after initial screening, and after consulta tion with the Sponsor.

Discontinued Participan ts Continuing to be Monitored in the Study 8.10.5 If a participant is discontinued from the stud y intervention early, the Discontinuation Visit assessments are to be performed as soon as possible. It is intended that all participants should be followed through co mpletion of the study , regardless of premature discontinuation of intervention unless the participant withdraws consent. Thus, participants who discontinue from study intervention prior to completion of the study should continue to be monitored to obtain r elevant information through the end of the study . Study site visits/ telephone calls should be made at timepoints that correspond to each remaining study visit. The follow -up information, limited to AEs, concomitant medication use, and patient report outcom es (site visits only ) will be collected as outlined in the SoA. Concomitant therap ies specifically prohibited (see Section 6.5) while the participant was on study intervention are no longer prohibited after discontinuation of study intervention . For these participants who have discontinued study intervention early, sites will be instructed to exert diligent efforts to continue to contact them. To enable sites to reach participants, the participants should provide primary and secondary contact info rmation (eg, home telephone, work telephone, mobile telephone). Sites must document the outcome of the telephone contact(s), to demonstrate diligent efforts have been made. If a participant does not agree to be contacted for follow -up for each of the remai ning visits (as described in Section 7.1), the participant should be encouraged to accept a telephone contact at least at Visit 8 date. Additionally , the ICF will explain the importance of continued data collection from participants, including the use of c ontinued contact by telephone. Follow -up Period 8.10.6 All p articipants will be required to complete the safety follow -up telephone contact approximately 14 day s(+7 day s)after the last dose of study interventio n to determine if an y AEs have occurred since disco ntinuing study intervention . 9 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN This section outlines the statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study.

Primary Endpoint Adverse events (AEs) Study treatment discontinuations due to AE Statistical Methods for Key Efficacy AnalysesChange from baseline in LCQ total score at Week 12 and through Week 52 will be anal yzed using thelongitudinal analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model . The model will include terms for treatment, visit, the interactions of treatment by visit, and baseline value as covariates. The change from baseline to each visit and 95% CI s will be estimated from this model . Statistical Methods for Key Safety AnalysesAEs will be summarized by the number and percentage of the participant s who experienced respective events. Change from baseline in laboratory tests, vital signs at respective timepoints will be summarized by descriptive statistics. Interim Analyses The planned interim analy sis(safet y and efficacy) will be performed based on the data up to Week 24 when all the randomized participants have completed Week 24 or discontinued prior to Week 24. Multiplicity No multiplicity adjustment is planned in this trial. Sample Size and Power A total of 1 60 participant s will be enrolled.

Safety Analysis Population 9.5.2 The APaT populat ion will be used for the anal ysis of safet y data in this study. The APaT population consists of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. Participants will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the stud y treatment they actually received for the analy sis of safet y data using the APaT population. Discontinued participants before Week 52 will be included in APaT population . For most participants this will be the treatment group to which they are randomized. Participants who take incorrect stud y treatment for the entire treatment period will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the study treatment actually received. At least one laboratory or vital sign measurement obtained subsequent to at leas t one dose of study treatment is required for inclusion in the analy sis of each specific parameter. To assess change from baseline, a baseline measurement is also required. 9.6 Statistical Methods The results will be provided by treatment group and total (comb ined treatment group) . There is no plan to do between treatment group comparisons . Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses 9.6.1 The anal ysis of efficacy endpoints will be based on the FAS population. Thecontinuous endpoints will be analy zed using thelongitu dinal analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA) model . In this model, response variable will be change from baseline. The model will include terms for treatment, visit, and the interactions of treatment by visit and baseline value as covariates .

Regardless of the result of the interim anal ysis (safety and efficacy ), the study will continue as planned. Double blinding onl y to treatment assignment will be maintained at all investigational sites after all participants have completed Week 24. The results of interim analyses (safet y and efficacy) will not be shared with the investigators prior to the completion of the study . The study will continue as double -blind only after Week 24 acknowledging that the sponsor will be unblinded at that point in order to analyze and report the data. The study team responsible for the ongoing mo nitoring of the study will remain blinded to the treatment -level results of this interim analy sis (safet y and efficacy). 9.8 Multiplicity No multiplicity adjustment is planned in this trial. 9.9 Sample Size and Power Calculations A total of 1 60 participants will be enrolled. Assuming a discontinuation rate of approximately 47%, 84 participants are expected to complete 52 weeks of treatment. The discontinuation rate was estimated from previous study (Protocol 012), which was 12 weeks study . The probability of obse rving at least one AE in this study depends on the number of participants treated and underlying incidence with an AE in the study population.

(MSD) Code of Conduct for Interventional Clinical Trials I. Introduction A.Purpose MSD, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing and reporting these trials in compliance with the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participant s inclinical trials is the overriding concern in the design of clinical trials . In all cases, M SD clinical trials will be conducted in compliance with local and/or national regulations (eg, International Council for Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice [ICH - GCP]) and in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Hel sinki. B.Scope Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sponsored by MSD irrespective of the party (parties) employed for their execution (eg, contract research organizations, collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials that are observational in nature, or which are retrospective. Further, this Code does not apply to investigator -initiated trials , which are not under the full control of M SD. II.Scientific Issues A.Trial Conduct 1.Trial Design Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy, and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices of M SD or comparator products. Alternatively, M SDmay conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or trials to determine patient preferences, etc. The design (ie, participant population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific purpose of the trial. P articipants must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial. 2.Site Selection MSD selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access to appropriate participants, adequacy of facilities and staff, previous pe rformance in clinical trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial initiation, sites are evaluated by M SD personnel to assess the ability to successfully conduct the trial. 3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity Investigative t rial sites ar e monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and general principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP). MSD reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Data are verified versus source documentation according to standard oper ating procedures. Per M SD policies and procedures, if fraud, scientific/research misc onduct, or serious GCP -noncompliance is suspected, the issues areinvestigated. When necessary, the clinical site will be closed, the responsible regulatory authorities and ethics review committees notified. 050YZQ 05PZB6"

To the extent scientifically appropriate, MSDseeks to publish the results of other analyses it conducts that are important to patients, physicians, and payers. Some early phase or pilot trials are intended to be hypothesis -generating rather than hypothesis testing , in such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues such as multiplicity. MSD’s policy on authorship is consistent with the re commendations published by the International Committee of Medica l Journal Editors (ICMJE). In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and conduct of the trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. M SD funding of a trial will be acknowledged in publications. III.Participant Protection A. Ethics Committee Review (Institutiona Review Board [ IRB]/Independent Ethics Committee [ IEC]) All clinical trials will be reviewed and approved by an IRB/IEC before being initiated at each site. Significant changes or revisions to the protocol will be approved by the ethics committee prior to implementation, except changes required urgently to prot ect participant safety that may be enacted in anticipation of ethics committee approval. For each site, the ethics committee and M SDwill approve the par ticipant informed consent form. B. Safety The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials i s that participant welfare is of primary importance. Potential participants will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At a minimum, trial designs will take into account the local stand ard of care. All p articipation in M SD clinical trials is voluntary. Participants enter the trial only after informed consent is obtained. Participants may withdraw from a n MSD trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, or receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them. C. Confidentiality MSD is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent possible. Unless required by law, only the investigator, Sponsor (or representative), ethics committee, and/or regulator y authorities will have access to confidential medical records t hat might identify the participant by name. D. Genomic Research Genomic r esearch will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed consent authorized by an ethics c ommittee. IV. Financial Considerations A. Paym ents to Investigators Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive. It is M SD’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of M SD trials. M SD does not pay incentives to enroll participants in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional payments may be made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts. MSD does not pay for participant referrals. Howeve r, MSD may compensate referring physicians for time spent on chart review to identify potentially eligible participants. 050YZQ 05PZB6"

However, the local ethics committee may wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As noted above, all publications resulting from M SD trials will indicate M SD as a source of funding. C. Funding for Travel and Other Requests Funding of travel by investigators and support staff (eg, to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be consistent with local guidelines and practices . V.Investigator Commit ment Investigators will be expected to review M SD’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the protocol, agree to support these ethical and scientific standards. Financial Disclosure 10.1.2 Financial Disclosure requirements are outlined in the US Food and Drug Administration Regulations, Financial Disclosure b y Clinical I nvestigators (21 CFR Part 54). I t is the Sponsor's responsibility to determine, based on these regulations, whether a request for Financial Disclosure information is required. It is the investigator's/subinvestigator's responsibility to comply with any such request. The investigator/subinvestigator(s) agree, if requested by the Sponsor in accordance with 21 CFR Part 54, to provide his/her financial interests in and/or arrangements with the Sponsor to allow for the submission of complete and accurate certification and disclosure statements. The investigator/subinvestigator(s) further agree to provide this informa tion on a Certification/Disclosure Form, commonly known as a financial disclosure form, provided by the Sponsor. The investigator/subinvestigator(s) also consent to the transmission of this information to the Sponsor in the United States for these purposes . This may involve the transmission of information to countries that do not have laws protecting personal data. Data Protection 10.1.3 Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the Sponsor. An y participant records or datasets that are transferred to th e Sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names or an y information that would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred. The participant must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by the Sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be explained to the participant. The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by Clinical Quality Assurance auditors or other authori zed personne l appointed by the S ponsor, by appropriate IRB/IEC members, and b y inspectors from regulatory authorities. 050YZQ 05PZB6"

An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening •The term “ life-threatening ”in the definition of “serious ”refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which h ypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization •Hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay, even if the hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: Hospitalization for an elective procedure to treat a pre -existing c ondition that has not worsened is not an SAE. A pre -existing condition is a clinical condition that is diagnosed prior to the use of an MSD product and is documented in the participant’s medical history . d.Results in persistent or significant disability/inca pacity •The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 050YZQ 05PZB6"

Assessment of i ntensity •An event is defined as “serious ”when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rated as severe. •The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE (and other reportable safet y event) reported during the stud y and assign it to 1 of the following categories: -Mild: An event that is easily tolerated b y the participant, causing minimal discomfort, and not interfering with every day activities (for pediatric studies, awa reness of symptoms, but easily tolerated). -Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort to interfere with normal every day activities (for pediatric studies, definitely acting like something is wrong). -Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category used for rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be assessed as severe (for pediatric studies, extremely distressed or unable to do usua l activities).

A biomarker may be used to see how well the body responds to a treatment for a disease or condition . b) Pharmacogenomics: The investigation of variations of DNA and RNA characteristics as related to dr ug/vaccine response.2 c) Pharmacogenetics: A subset of pharmacogenomics, pharmacogenetics is the influence of variations in DNA sequence on drug/vaccine response.2 d) DNA: Deox yribonucleic acid. e) RNA: Ribonucleic acid. 2.Scope of Future Biomedical Research The specimens consented and/or collected in this study as outlined in Section 8.9will be used in various experiments to understand:  The biology of how drugs/vaccines work  Biomarkers responsible for how a drug/vaccine enters and is removed b y the body  Other pathway s drugs/vaccines may interact with  The biology of disease The specimen(s) may be used for future assay development and/or drug/vaccine development. It is now well recognized that information obtained from studying and testing clinical specimens of fers unique opportunities to enhance our understanding of how individuals respond to drugs/vaccines, enhance our understanding of human disease and ultimately improve public health through development of novel treatments targeted to populations with the gr eatest need. All specimens will be used by the Sponsor or those working for or with the Sponsor. 3.Summary of Procedures for Future Biomedical Research. a)Participants for Enrollment All participants enrolled in the clinical study will be considered for enroll ment in the future biomedical research substudy 050YZQ 05PZB6"
80,page_80,"PRODUCT: MK-7264 80 PROTOCOL/AMENDMENT N O.:038-01 MK-7264 -038-01FINAL PROTOCOL 26-SEP-2018 b)Informed Consent Informed consent for specimens (ie, DNA, RNA, protein, etc.) will be obtained during screening for protocol enrollment from all participants or legal guardians, at a study visit by the invest igator or his or her d esignate. Informed consent for future biomedical r esearch should be presented to the participants on the visit designated in the SoA. If delay ed, present consent at next possible Participant Visit. Consent forms signed b y the particip ant will be kept at the clinical study site under secure storage for regulatory reasons. A template of each stud y site’s approved informed consent will be stored in the Sponsor’s clinical document repository . c)eCRF Documentation for Future Biomedical Research Specimens Documentat ion of participant consent for future biomedical research will be captured in the eCRFs . Any specimens for which such an informed consent cannot be verified will be destroy ed. d)Future Biomedical Research Specimen(s) Collection o f specimens for future biomedical r esearch will be performed as outlined in the SoA. I n general, if additional blood specimens are being collected for future biomedical r esearch, these will usually be obtained at a time when the participant is having blood drawn for other study purposes. 4.Confidential Participant Information for Future Biomedical Research In order to optimize the resea rch that can be conducted with future biomedical r esearch specimens, it is critical to link participant' clinical information with future test results. I n fact little or no research can be conducted without connecting the clinical study data to the specimen. The clinical data allow specific analyses to be conducted. Knowing participant characteristics like gender, age, medical h istory and treatment outcomes are critical to understanding clinical context of anal ytical results. To maintain privacy of information collect ed from specimens obtained for future biomedical r esearch, the Sponsor has developed secure policies and procedure s. All specimens will be single -coded per ICH E15 guidelines as described below. At the clinical study site, unique codes will be placed on the future biomedical r esearch specimens. This code is a random number which does not contain an y personally identif ying information embedded within it. The link (or key ) between participant identifiers and this unique code will be held at the study site. No personal identifiers will appear on the specimen tube. 050YZQ 05PZB6"

Anal yses utilizing the future biomedical r esearch specimens may be performed by the Sponsor, or an additional third party (eg, a university investigator) designated by the Sponsor. The inve stigator conducting the anal ysis will follow the Sponsor’s privacy and confidentialit y requirements. An y contracted third part y anal yses will conform to the specific scope o f anal ysis outlined in this substudy . Future biomedical r esearch specimens remainin g with the third part y after specific anal ysis is performed will be reported to the Sponsor. 6.Withdrawal From Future Biomedical Research Participants may withdraw their consent for future biomedical research and ask that thei r biospecimens not be used for f uture biomedical r esearch. Participants may withdraw consent at an y time b y contacting the principal investigator for the main study. If medical records for the main study are still available, the investigator will contact the Sponsor using the designated mailbox (clinical.specimen.management@merck.com). Subsequently , the participant's specimens will be flagged in the biorepository and restricted to main stud y use only . If specimens were collected from study participants specificall y for future biomedical r esearch, these specimens will be removed from the biorepository and destroyed. Documentation will be sent to the investigator confirming withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the investigator to inform the participant of completion of the withdrawal and/or destruction, if applicable. Any anal yses in progress at the time of request for withdrawal/destruction or alread y performed prior to the request being received b y the Sponsor will continue to be used as part of the over all research study data and results. No new analy ses would be generated after the request is received. In the event that the medical records for the main study are no longer available (eg, if the investigator is no longer required b y regulatory authorities to retain the main study records) or the specimens have been completel y anonymized, there will no longer be a link between the participant’s personal information and their specimens. In this situation, the request for withdrawal of consent and/or destruct ion cannot be processed. 7.Retention of Specimens Future biomedical r esearch specimens will be stored in the biorepository for potential analysis for up to 20 y ears from the end of the main study . Specimens may be stored for longer if a regulatory or governm ental authorit y has active questions that are being answered. In this special circumstance, specimens will be stored until these questions have been adequatel y addressed. Specimens from the study site will be shipped to a central laboratory and then shipped to the Sponsor -designated biorepository . If a central laboratory is not utilized in a particular study , the stud y site will ship directly to the Sponsor -designated biorepository . The specimens will be stored under strict supervision in a limited access f acility which 050YZQ 05PZB6"

Analysis Populations Efficacy: Full Analysis Set (FAS) population. Safety: All Participants as Treated (APaT) population . Primary Endpoint Adverse events (AEs) Study treatment discontinuations due to AE Statistical Methods for Key Efficacy AnalysesChange from baseline in LCQ total score at Week 12 and through Week 52 will be analyzed using the longitudinal analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. The model will include terms for treatment, visit, the interactions of treatment by visit, and baseline value as covariates . The change from baseline to each visit and 95% CIs will be estimated from this model. Statistical Methods for Key Safety AnalysesAEs will be summarized by the number and percentage ofthe participants who experienced respective events. Change from baseline in laboratory tests, vital signs at respective timepoints will be summarized by descriptive statistics. Interim Analyses The planned interim efficacy analysis will be performed based on the data up to Week 24 when all the randomized participants have completed Week 24 or discontinued prior to Week 24.Safety analysis will include all available data up to the cutoff date for the interim database lock. Multiplicity No multiplicity adjustment is planned in this trial. Sample Size and Power A total of 160 participants will be enrolled. Assuming a discontinuation rate of approximately 47% at Week 52, 84participants are expected to complete 52 weeks of treatment. 3.2 Responsibility for Analyses / In- house Blinding The statistical analysis of the data obtained from this study will be the responsibility of the Sponsor. This study will be conducted as a double -blind study under in-house blinding procedures. Double blinding technique with in-house blinding will be used until all the randomized participants have completed Week 24 or discontinued prior to Week 24 after which a double blinding only technique will be used. The official, final database will not be unblinded until medical/scientific review has been performed, protocol deviations have been identified, and data have been declared final and complete. The Clinical Biostatist ics department will generate the randomized allocation schedule(s) for study treatment assignment. 3.3 Hypotheses / Estimation There areno hy potheses for this study . 05GNX3 05PZDH"

The FAS population consists of all randomized participants who have taken at least one dose of study medication and provided at least one baseline andone post-baseline endpoint observations during the treatment period. Participants will be included in the treatment group to which they are randomized for the analysis of efficacy data using the FAS populations. 3.5.2 Safety Analysis Populations The APaT population will be used for the analysis of safety data in this study . The APaT population consists of all randomized participants who received at least one dose of study treatment. Participants will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the study treatment they actuall y received for the analy sis of safety data using the APaT population. Discontinued participants before Week 52 will be included in APaT populat ion. For most participants this will be the treatment group to which they are randomized. Participants who take incorrect study treatment for the entire treatment period will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the study treatment actually received. 05GNX3 05PZDH
95,page_95,"MK-7264 PAGE 7 PROTOCOL NO. 038-01 - AMENDMENT 2 SUPPLEMENTAL SAP 14-APR -2020 If a participant is found to have taken one or more incorrect doses of study medication from that to which he/she was randomized, then the participant will be counted in the higher dose arm he/she actuall y received; that is, if a participant was originall y randomized to MK-7264 15 mg but during the course of the study has taken 1 or more doses of MK -7264 45 mg, then the participant will be included in the MK-7264 45 mg treatment arm in the safet y analysis. At least one laboratory or vital sign measurement obtained subsequent to at least one dose of study treatment is required for inclusion in the analy sis of each specific parameter. To assess change from baseline, a baseline measurement is also required. 3.6 Statistical Methods The results will be provided by treatment group and total (combined treatment group) . There is no plan to do between treatment group comparisons . 3.6.1 Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses The analysis of efficacy endpoints will be based on the FAS population. Unless specified otherwise, analyses will include all follow -up efficacy data collected for those participants who discontinued treatment. The continuous endpoints will be analy zed using thelongitudinal analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. In this model, response variable will be change from baseline. The model will include terms for treatment, visit, and the interaction of treatment by visitand baseline value as a covariate . Visit is treated as a categorical variable so that no restriction is imposed on the trajectory of the means over time. Anunstructured covariance matrix will be used to model correlations among repeated measures. If the unstructured covariance structure fails to converge with the default algorithm, then the AR(1) structure can be used to provide initial values of the covariance parameters. This model uses the maximum likelihood principle to estimate the parameters and account for missing data in an implicit fashion. The change from baseline to each visit and 95% CIs will be estimated from this model. Baseline variable is defined as the last non- missing value prior to the treatment. Categorical endpoints will be analy zed by calculating the percentage of participant s in each response category at each timepoint . For some endpoints (change from baseline in LCQ total score, change from baseline in mean weekly CSD total score) , percentage of participan ts meeting certain threshold value swill also be provided. Only observed data will be included in the anal ysis. Considerat ions for the analy sis specific to the respective endpoints are provided below. LCQ total score Change from baseline in the LCQ total score will be analyzed using the longitudinal ANCOVA model above to estimate within- treatment change from baseline and corresponding 95% CI at each time point . Percentage of participan ts who had an increase in the total score of ≥1.3 po intsfrom baseline at each time point will also be summarized. 05GNX3 05PZDH"

If there is only 1 item is missing, the Physical domain score will be based on the actual non-missing items. Psychological domain score will be derived in a similar fashion. The Social domain score will be considered as missing if any item is missing. The LCQ total score will be considered as missing if an y of the 3 domain scores is missing. Mean weekly CSD total score Change from baseline in the mean weekly CSD total score will beanaly zed using the longitudinal ANCOVA model above to estimate within -treatment change from baseline and corresponding 95% CI at each time point. Percentage of participants who had a reduction in the total score of ≥1.3 and ≥2.7 points from baseline at each time point, respectively , will also be summarized. The mean weekl y total score will be considered missing if there are less than 4 non- missing days during the week prior to each visit. If there are less than 7 but at least 4 non-missing days during the week prior to a visit, the mean weekl y total score will be based on theactual non-missing days of the week prior to the visit. Mean weekl y subscales will bederived in a similar fashion. EQ5D -5L Change from baseline in the EQ5D -5L index utility score will be analy zed using the longitudinal ANCOVA model above to estimate within -treatment change from baseline and corresponding 95% CI at each time point. If a participant has a missing response to an y of the five individual questions at a particular timepo int, then the entire response for that participant at that timepoint will be considered missing. EQ VAS Change from baseline in EQ VAS will also be analy zed using the longitudinal ANCOVA model above to estimate within -treatment change from baseline and cor responding 95% CI at each time point. PGIC Percentage of participants with each response to the PGICquestionnaire will be summarized at each timepoint. Percentage of participant s with improvements (either ""very much improved"" or ""much improved"" on thePGIC scale) will also besummarized at each time point. 05GNX3 05PZDH"

All safet y anal yses will be based on the APaT population. AEs and other safet y events will be summarized using the number and percentage of the participants who experienced respective events. The AEs observed up to 14 days after the last dose will be included in the anal ysis. Taste - related AEs (including dysgeusia, ageusia, and hypogeusia, as well as other related terms) and oral paraesthesia/hy poesthesia are considered as AEs of interest. Continuous measures such as changes from baseline in laboratory , vital signs parameters w ill be summarized using descriptive statistics. Summary statistics for baseline, on treatment, and change from baseline values will be provided in table format. 05GNX3 05PZDH"

Demographic variables (including age, gender, weight, and height), baseline characteristics, primary and comorbid conditions, and prior and concomitant therapies will be summarized either b y descriptive statistics or categorical tables. 3.7 Interim Analyses All efficacy analyses will be performed based on the data up to Week 24 when all the randomized participants have completed Week 24 or discontinued prior to Week 24.Safety analysis will include all available data up to the cutoff date for the interim database lock. Regardless of the result of the interim analy sis (safet y and efficacy ), the study will continue as planned. Double blinding only to treatment assignment will be maintained at all investigational sites after all participants have completed Week 24. The results of interim analyses (safet y and efficacy ) will not be shared with the investigators prior to the completion of the study. The study will continue as double -blind only after Week 24 acknowledging that the sponsor will be unblinded at that point in order to analyze and report the data. The study team responsi ble for the ongoing monitoring of the study will remain blinded to the treatment -level results of this interim analy sis (safet y and efficacy). 3.8 Multiplicity No multiplicity adjustment is planned in this trial. 3.9 Sample Size and Power Calculations A total of 160 participants will be enrolled. Assuming a discontinuation rate of approximately 47%, 84participants are expected to complete 52 weeks of treatment. The discontinuation rate was estimated from previous study (Protocol 012), which was a 12 week study . The probability of observing at least one AE in this study depends on the number of participants treated andtheunderl ying incidence with an AE in the study population. If the underly ing incidence of an AE is 2%, the probability of observing at least one AE is 82% among 84 participants and 57% among 42 participants. If no participants had a specific AE, then the upper bound of the 95% CI of the underly ing incidence rate would be 4.3% for 84 participants and 8.4% for 42 participants. For LCQ total score, assuming a 3.7 change from baseline and a SD of 3.9 at Week 12 based on Protocol 012, a 95% confidence interval of change from baseline in LCQ total score would be (2.9, 4.5) for 84 participants and (2.5, 4.9) for 42 participants. 05GNX3 05PZDH"

When a participant takes less than or more than the required medication on a day, that day is not cons idered an On- Therap y day. For participants who are followed for the entire study period, the “Number of Days Should Be on Therap y” is the total number of days from the first scheduled treatment day to the last scheduled treatment day. For participants who discontinue from the study medication permanentl y, the “Number of Days Should Be on Therap y” is the total number of days from the first scheduled treatment day to the last dose day . Summary statistics will be provided on percent compliance for the APaT population. 3.12 Extent of Exposure The duration of treatment for each participant will be evaluated by calculating the number of days on therap y. Exposure to study medication will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maxi mum) for the APaT population. Appendi x:Relative day ranges Since it is not alway s possible for all study participants to come in for their clinic visits on the exact dayspecified in the protocol schedule, the following relative day ranges will be define d for each time point.

If there are observations before and after the scheduled day that are equally apart from the scheduled day, then the observation after the scheduled day will be used for analysis. If two or more measurements are obtained on the same day , the average will be used as the observation for the day . Baseline variable is defined as the last non-missing value prior to treatment. Typicall y this is the measurement taken at Visit 1 or Visit 2, depending on the endpoint. 05GNX3 05PZDH"
