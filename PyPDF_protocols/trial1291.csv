14,page_14,"Novartis Confidential Page 15 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CQGE031C2202 1 Introduction 1.1 Background Chronic spontaneous urticaria ( CSU )is defined as the spontaneous occurrence of itchy wheals, angioedema or both lasting for at lea st 6 weeks ( Zuberbier et al2014). The classic description of urticaria is a wheal and flare with a pale elevated lesion and surrounding ery thema, ranging in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters across, usuall y occurring in groups and often coalescing to form large confluent lesions. CSU can be debilitating and isassociated with intense itching and has a major impact on patient’s well-being, suggested to be comparable to that of severe coronary artery disease (Greaves 2003 ,Powell et al2007). The symptoms of urticaria and urticaria associated angioedema adversel y affect daily activities and sleep (O'Donnell et al 1997 ). The lifetime prevalence of CSU is approximately 1.8%, and 20% of CSU patients still have the disease after 20 years (Zuberbier et al 2010, Greaves 2000 ).CSU is more common in adults than in children. The pathogenesis of CSU is not fully clear. Up to 50% of CSU cases are associated with histamine -releasing autoantibodies against either the high -affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) or IgE antibodies; the clinical significance of these autoantibodies is unclear, though there are suggestions that they may be involved in disease pathogenesis ( Kaplan 2002, Sabroe and Greaves 2006 ). It has also been suggested that CSU patients’ basophils may havedistinct alterations in FcεRIα -mediated degranulation, independent of any potential role of autoantibodies ( Eckman et al 2008). A majority of CSU patients can be treated with H1antihistamine monotherap y, which is frequentl y used at doses up to four fold the approved dose (Zuberbier et a l 2014). The use of H 2 antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonist ( LTRA )are not as well supported by clinical studies, although they have been recommended in treatment guidelines for patients who were symptomatic despite treatment with H1antih istamines (Bernstein et al 2014). Systemic corticosteroids are sometimes added to the treatment regimens, however this is not recommended in treatment guidelines for long term treatment as patients are then at risk of adverse effects associated with chronic s ystemic corticosteroid exposure. Omalizumab has demonstrated efficacy in patients with CSU and has been approved in several countries including europe ( EU), United States ( US), Japan and Switzerland as add -on therap y in adult and adolescent patients with symptoms despite treatment with antihistamines. The completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies demonstrated that omalizumab improves the signs and symptoms of urticaria (e.g., itch, hives) in patients with CSU who have failed treatment with H1antihistamines as well as those who have failed treatment with a combination of H 1and H2 antihistamines and a L TRA ( Gober et al 2008, Kaplan et al 2008 ,Maurer et al 2013 ,Kaplan et al2013 ). The primary endpoint, reductions from baseline in mean weekl y itch-severit y scores (ISS7) and all pre-specified secondary end points (e.g., change from basel ine in UAS7 (urticaria activity score over 7 day s), weekl y score for hive numbers (HSS7), proportion of patients with UAS7 ≤6) were dose-responsive. The exact mechanism for how omalizumab does work in CSU patients is still not completely understood. The understanding of the mode of action (MoA ) beyond suppression of free -IgE is evolving ( Fine and Bernstein 2016 ,Chang et al 2015 )."
15,page_15,"Novartis Confidential Page 16 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CQGE031C2202 Revision of recent guidelines for the management of CSU patients confirmed that the therapeutic goal is complete remission of the signs and symptoms (i.e. UAS7 score of 0) (Zuberbier et al 2014); only about 40% of patients were free of sy mptoms at week 12 with the highest omalizumab dose tested (300 mg) in published Phase 3 studies (Maurer et al 2013, Kaplan et al2013). Therefore, an unmet medical need exists in the CSU patient population despite the availability of omalizumab (Xolair®). Whilst the disease is less studied in pediatric patients its understanding in the pediatric population is also starting to evolve ( Maurer et al2017). Urticaria can occur in all age groups. The same disease classi fication with the distinction of acute and chronic urticaria, the latter distinguishing between CSU and chronic inducible urticaria (CINDU ), is currently used to classify urticaria in infants, children and adolescents. Whilst there appears to be no conclusive epidemiologic data in children and adolescents, chronic urticaria may be less common in the pedi atric and adolescent population. However, similar as in adults there is an unmet medical need in children. Recent studies indicated low rate of resolution in the pediatric age group of 10% annually suggesting that CSU is a long lasting disease in children as well ( Netchiporouk 2017 ). Ligelizumab (QGE03 1)is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) with higher affinit y binding to human immunoglobulin E (IgE) than omalizumab. Upon binding, ligelizumab is able to block the interaction of IgE with both the high and low affinit y IgE receptors (FcɛRI and FcɛRII) . Ligelizumab is unable to mediate IgE receptor cross- linking and consequentl y histamine release (i.e. non-anaph ylactogenic). When patients receive ligelizumab , circulating IgE is rapidly bound by the anti-IgE antibody and becomes inaccessible to IgE recep tors on mast cells and basophils. IgE is necessary for the enhanced expression of the FcεRI seen in atopic patients, and a decrease in FcεRI expression on circulating basophils accompanies ligelizumab treatment. Other potentiall y beneficial effects from anti-IgE therapy include decreased IgE production, reduced B cell numbers and reduced cy tokine production by T cells. Based upon the dose response observed in omalizumab CSU studies (Maurer et al2013 ), superior affinity and pharmacody namic outcomes of ligelizumab compared to omalizumab are anticipated to translate into superior clinical efficacy . Thus the ligelizumab development program in CSU aims to deliver a superior response compared with omalizumab with a similar safet y profile in patients not adequatel y controlled with H1- antihistamines. Whilst the disease presentation and medical need in adolescents appears to be the same asin adults there remains the question as to whether adolescent patients should receive the same dose as adults, as they do for Xolair®.Consequentl y , before enrolling adolescents in confirmatory Phase 3 studies, this small study will ascertain whether thisage group benefit sfrom ligelizumab and, through administration of two active dose levels anda separate exposure -response data analysis study , determine the relative potency ofligelizumab compared with adults."

The study design has been agreed with the PDCO (Pediatric Committee (EU)). It consists of 3 distinct study periods , as outlined in Figure 3-1 below. After the screening period (up to 4 weeks), at Da y 1 patients are randomized into one of the three treatment arms in 1:2:1 fashion to ligelizumab 120 mg q4w vs. ligelizumab 24 mg q4w vs. placebo. During the 24 weeks of treatment, doses are administered onDay 1 then 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks after randomization. Subjects randomized to placebo will receive placebo onDay 1,Weeks 4 and 8 ; thereafter they will receive 120 mg ligelizumab on Week 12, 16 and 20such that the same number of patients will, by the end of the study , receive 120 mg as 24 mg. Safety isassessed every 4 weeks ; efficacy is primarily assessed using daily itch and hives scores summed into the weekl y UAS7 . The treatment period (24 weeks) is followed by a follow - up period of 16 weeks to a maximum of Week 40 ."
19,page_19,"Novartis Confidential Page 20 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CQGE031C2202 Figure 3-1 Study design R: Randomization Screen ing Patients will have up to 4 week s for screening to establish eligibility for the study . Patients will be required to attend two visits during the screening period : at Day −28 and Day −7. The Day - 7 can be brought forward depending on the availability of all laboratory results and the adherence to wash- outs related to non -allowed medication. Only in exceptional circumstances, when information concerning eligibility is outstanding (e.g. pending laboratory data), will an extended screening period be permitted. For certain Inclusion/Exclusion criteria, re-screening may be allowed for patients who fail initial screening (see Section 4.1and 4.2). Only one re-screening will be allowed. If a patient rescreens for the stud y, the patient and their legal guardian (where applicable) must sign a new informed consent and child’s assent and he/she will be issued a new subject number. Informed consent for a rescreened patient must be obtained prior to performing any study-related assessments or collecting any data for the screening visit. Double -blind treatment period On Day 1, eligible patients will be randomly assigned to receive ligelizumab 24 mg, 120 mg or placebo s.c. q4w during the 24-week double -blind treatment period. It is planned to allocate approximately 12patients to the ligelizumab 120 mgq4w, 24 patients to the ligelizumab 24mg q4w and 12 patients to the placebo arm q4w. Patients are expected to attend all site visits based on the assessment schedule ( Table 6-1 )."

As background medication, all patients in this study will continue to receive H1-antihistamines. Patients should remain on a stable treatment regimen throughout the study . Post -treatment follow -up period After the completion of the double -blind treatment period , patients will enter a post-treatment follow -up period to allow for further characterization of the PK and response to ligelizumab as the drug washes out, collection of additional efficacy and safet y data (e.g. relapse), and evaluation of the presence ofanti-drug antibodies (ADAs). The follow -up period is 16weeks with the last follow -up visit at day 281 (Week 40) corresponding to 20weeks after the last treatment dose. No investigational treatment will be given during the post -treatment follow -up period, . Patients will be required to visit the study center every four weeks during post -treatment period. 3.2 Rationale for study design The study uses a placebo -controlled parallel -group design to allow the assessment of the treatm ent effects in an unbiased fashion and to account for placebo effects. The duration of the placebo treatment is restricted to twelve weeks to reduce the time adolescents are having symptoms that would require a more effective treatment. Patients having rec eived placebo will be rolled over to the 120 mg ligelizumab arm to collect further safety and efficacy data and give them an opportunity for a pronounced symptom improvement upon continuation of the study . 3.3 Rationale for dose/regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment"
21,page_21,"Novartis Confidential Page 22 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CQGE031C2202 a 3.4 Rationale for choice of comparator The comparator treatment in this study is placebo. Placebo is used in this study for the following reasons: to allow blinding of investigators and patients to their treatment and thereby minimize bias in the evaluation of safety and efficacy assessme nts, to allow assessment of the improvement in terms of CSU control for patients with disease not controlled by background medication who are treated with ligelizumab , in comparison to those continuing solely on background medication, and to allow the asse ssment of safet y of ligelizumab on top of background medication compared to background medication alone All patients, regardless of the treatment arm they are randomized to, will receive standard of care antihistamine therapy (approved doses) as background medication. Although the signs and symptoms of CSU are burdensome to patients, placebo trials have been safel y and successfully conducted in this indication ( Kaplan et al 2013 ,Maurer et al 2013). Administration of placebo has been limited to 12 weeks while still allowing statistical comparison and maintenance of blinding to active versus placebo treatment .Patients having received placebo will be rolled over to the 120 mgligelizumab arm to collect further safet y and efficac y data and give them an opportunity for a pronounced s ymptom improvement upon continuation of the study . Patients have been allocated across the treatment arms according to the number needed to satisfy data requirements for optimal modeling and the number of placebo used has been kept to the minimum that still allows a meaningful analy sis from the study data."

This will allow to identify the best dose regimen that is used in adolescent patients. At the point of enrollment of adolescents substantial safety data supporting the safe use of ligelizumab has been collected in adult patient population. Overall ligelizumab is an investigational drug considered to be safe and well tolerated . The risk to subjects in this trial will be minimized by compliance with the eligibility criteria , study procedures andclose clinical monitoring . Potential risks for study participants"

24,page_24,"Novartis Confidential Page 25 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CQGE031C2202 Blood sampling and volumes Blood volumes taken on single visit days and during the whole trial will be kept to a minimum to allow analy ses of the key parameters specified for determining safet y and pharmacod ynamics effects and also to keep within the limits of health authority recommendations ( EMA 2017 ). Possible benefits for the study participant s In a Phase 2b study in adults, ligelizumab was very effective for the treatment of CSU. In comparison to omalizumab ,another effective IgE targeted antibody ,ligelizumab was superior in suppressing the cardinal sy mptoms of CSU ,hives and itch and led to freedom of symptoms in a higher percentage of patients than with omalizumab. Patients that receive a dose of 120 mg in the current study could be expected to achieve such a response. Also the patients who receive placebo in the first part of the study and who will receive 120mg ligelizumab from week 12 onwards could expect a response as seen in adult patients with CSU . Whilst the patients who receive the lower dose of 24 mg may not achieve the same degree of sy mptom control as those who receive a 120 m g dose, they are,based on adult clinical data,expected to have a partial response . Note it is essential for the scientific integrit y of the stud y that the lower dose (24 mg) is not fully effective as otherwise no dose -response analy sis can be executed for the adolescent patient population. While all patients in the current study could achieve amelioration of their symptoms during the course of the study, i t should however be noted that there may be patients who do not respond to ligelizumab treatment at all."

A.Ligelizumab 120mg: 1 injection of ligelizumab (1mL ) every 4 weeks from Day 1 to Week 20 (inclusive) B.Ligelizumab 24 mg: 1 injection of ligelizumab (0.2mL ) every 4 weeks from Day 1 to Week 20 (inclusive) C.Placebo 0 mg: 1 injection of placebo (1 mL) at Day 1, Week 4, Week 8; followed by the same treatment as in Treatment A from week 12 onwards to week 20 (inclusive) 5.3 Treatment assignment and randomization At Day 1, all eligible patients will be randomized via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) to one of the treatment arms. The investigator or his/her delegate will inform the independent unblinded site personnel (pharmacist or authorized delegate) to contact the IRT after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The IRT will assign a randomization number to the patient, which will be used to link the patient to a treatment arm and will specify a unique medication number for the package of investigation al treatment to be dispensed to the"
29,page_29,"Novartis Confidential Page 30 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CQGE031C2202 patient and will specify the volume of dose. The randomization number will not be communicated to the caller. The randomization numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from patients and investigator staff. A patient randomization list will be produced by the IRT provider using a validated system that automates the random assignment of patient numbers to randomization numbers. These randomizatio n numbers are linked to the different treatment arms, which in turn are linked to medication numbers. A separate medication list will be produced by or under the responsibility of Novartis Drug Supply Management using a validated system that automates the random assignment of medication numbers to packs containin g the investigational drug(s). The randomization scheme for patients will be reviewed and approved by a member of the Randomization Group. 5.4 Treatment blinding Patients, investigator staff and perso nnel performing the study assessments will remain blinded to the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until final database lock. Data managers, programmers, statisticians, pharmacometricians and clinical experts of the Novartis trial team will also remain blinded until final database lock. An unblinded study monitor will visit the study site to monitor study drug related administration ( see Section 8.1) The following measures will be applied to keep the patient and study personnel blinded des pite differences of the investigational treatments in appearance, viscosit y and volume: The study drug must be prepared by an independent unblinded pharmacist (or authorized delegate) and administered by an indepe ndent unblinded administrator .If an unblinded pharmacist is not available preparation and administration of drug may also be performed by a single independent unblinded site person if he/she is authorized to do both. Any site staff involved in the prepar ation and / or administration of study drug must not be involved in an y of the study assessments .  Preparation of the investigational drug must be done in a separate space/room where patients and study personnel have no access.  To blind the liquid volume inthe syringe, the syringe must be covered by a strip of opaque tape. The differences in length of the syringe plunger, related to the differences in the volume, should also be covered by the way of administration (see pharmacist manual).  The independent unblinded authorized site persons (pharmacist/administrator) should not communicate the appearance, the volume and any perceived sensation associated with the administration of the investigational drug. The procedural details relating to treatment blinding a nd unblinded drug administration will be described in the Pharmacist Manual which will be provided separatel y. 1.Randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding, and will not be accessible b y anyone else involved in the study w ith the following exceptions:"
30,page_30,"Novartis Confidential Page 31 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CQGE031C2202  Bioanal yst (PK): to enable identification of samples from the ligelizumab treatment arms of the stud y to facilitate bioanalysis. Independent personnel (external to Novartis) involved in monitoring anaphy laxis and pre-malignanc y/malignancy events (Adjudication Committee members) if such events would occur . Unblinding during the conduct of the trial will only occur in the case of patient emergencies (Section 5.5.9). The patients, inves tigator staff and persons performing the assessments will remain blinded until after final database lock. Health authorities will be granted access to unblinded data if needed. The appropriate personnel from the study site and Novartis will assess whether study treatment should be discontinued for an y subject whose treatment code has been broken inadvertently for any reason. Study treatment must be discontinued after emergency unblinding . 5.5 Treating the patient Sponsor qualified medical personnel will be rea dily available to advise on trial related medical questions or problems. 5.5.1 Patient numbering Each patient is uniquely identified in the study by a Subject Number (Subject No.), that is assigned when the patient is first enrolled for screening and is retained as the primary identifier for the patient throughout his/her entire participation in the trial. The Subject No. consists of the Center Number (Center No.) (asassigned by Novartis to the investigative site) with a sequential subject number suffixed to it, so that each patient is numbered uniquely across the entire database. Once assigned to a patient, the Subject Number will not be reused. Upon signing the informed consent form, the patient is assigned the next sequential number available in the electronic data capture (EDC) system . The investigator or his/her staff will contact the IRT and provide the requested identify ing information for the patient to regist er them into the I RT. If the patient fails to be treated for any reason, the IRT must be notified within 2 day s that the patient was not treated. The reason for not being treated will be entered on the appropriate CRF . 5.5.2 Dispensing the study drug Each study site will be supplied with study drug in packaging of identical appearance. The study drug packaging has a 2- part label. A unique medication number is printed on each part of this label which corresponds to one of the “3” treatment a rms and a specific visit or dose/dose level . Investigator staff will identify the study drug package(s) to dispense to the patient by contacting the IRT and obtaining the medication number(s). Immediately before dispensing the package to the patient, investigator staff will detach the outer part of the label from the packaging and affix it to the source document (Drug Label Form) for that patient’s unique subject number."

Upon receipt, all study treatment must be stored according to the ins tructions specified on the labels. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in accordance with the protocol. Technical complaints are to be reported to the respective Novartis Country Organization (CO) Quality Assurance. Medication labels will be in the local language and comply with the legal requirements of each country . They will include storage conditions for the study treatment but no information about the patient except for the medication number. The independent unblinded site personnel must maintai n an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of study treatment in a drug accountability log. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by monitors during site visits or remotely and at the completion of the trial. Patients will be asked to return all unused study treatment and packaging at the end of the study or at the time of discontinuation of study treatment. At the conclusion of the study, and as appropriate during the course of the study, the unblinded dedicated site staff member will return all unused study treatment, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug accountability log to the unblinded monitor or to the appropriate address provided in the investigator folder at each site . 5.5.3.2 Handling of additional treatment The concomitant medication allowed in the trial is described in Sections 5.5.6 and 5.5.7. 5.5.4 Instructions for prescribing and taking study treatment The independent study drug administrator will administer the study treatment to the patient during the study visit without engaging in any unnecessary interactions that may have the potential to unblind the patient or any of the study site personnel. All study treatments will be administered at the hospital/clinic. The injection can be administered in the deltoid region on the right and/or left arm, and/or on the right and/or left thigh, or the abdomen as preferred by patient and/or site. The injection is administered subcutaneously after aspiration of the plunger of the syringe. If blood appears at the hub or blood is withdrawn into a syringe, the needle is removed without administration of the dose and the injection site is changed. The guidelines for the p reparation and administration of study medication are described in the pharmacist manual. Patients will remain on-site for observation for a period of 2 h post-dose for all study drug administration visits. This observation period follows the recommendatio n suggested by the National heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and by the American Academ y of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and the American College of Allergy , Asthma and Immunology Executive"

The dosing schedule for individual patients will be the same within a treatment arm and will be assigned at random ization ( Day 1). All study drug dosages prescribed and dispensed to the patient and all dose changes or missed administrations during the study must be recorded on the appropriate CRF page. All kits of study treatment assigned by the IRT will be recorded/databased in the I RT. 5.5.5 Permitted dose adjustments and interruptions of study treatment Study drug dose adjustments and interruptions are not permitted. Any missed or altered study drug administrations must be recorded on the a ppropriate CRF page in order to reconstruct an accurate d osing history for each patient. 5.5.7 Concomitant medication The investigator must instruct the patient to notify the study site about any new medications he/she takes after the patient was enrolled into the study . All medications, procedures and significant non-drug therapies (including physical therap y and blood transfusions) administered after the patient was enrolled into the study must be recorded in the appropriate CRF. Each concomitant drug must be individually assessed against all exclusion criteria/prohibited medication.

When the investigator contacts the system to break a treatment code for a patient, he/she must provide the requested patient identifying information a nd confirm the necessit y to break the treatment code for the patient. The investigator will then receive details of the investigational drug treatment for the specified patient and a fax or email confirming this information. The system will automatically inform the Novartis monitor for the site and the Study Team that the code has been broken. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a dependable procedure in place to allow access to the IRT at any time in case of emergency . The investigator will provide: protocol number study drug name (if available) subject number In addition, oral and written information to the patient must be provided on how to contact his/her backup in cases of emergency, or when he/she is unavailable, to ensure t hat un -blinding can be performed at an y time. T he appropriate personnel from the site and Novartis will assess whether investigational treatment should be discontinued for an y patient whose treatment code has been broken inadvertently for any reason. Patients who discontinue investigational treatment should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study . They will be expected to perform the Visit 170End of treatment/ Study treatment discontinuation (EOT/TD ) assessments four weeks after their last dose and will be expected to perform all follow -up assessments (Visit 180-210). If they fail to return for these assessments for unknown reasons, every effort (e.g., telephone, e-mail, letter) should be made to contact them. The investigator must also contact the IRT to register the patient ’s discontinuation from investigational treatment. 5.6 Stud y completion and d iscontinuation 5.6.1 Study completion and post- study treatment A patient will be considered to have completed the study when the patient has completed the last visit planned in the protocol. The investigator must call or logon to the IRT system to record the patient completion . No post -study treatment is planned for this trial. 5.6.2 Discontin uation of study t reatment Discontinuation of study treatment for a patient occurs when study drug is stopped earlier than the protocol planned duration, and can be initiated by either the patient or the investigator at any time ."
35,page_35,"Novartis Confidential Page 36 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CQGE031C2202 The investigator must discontinue study treatment for a given patient if, on balance, he/she believes that continuation would negativel y impact the risk/benefit of trial participation. Investigational treatment must be discontinued under the following circumstances: Patient /guardian wish Pregnancy (seeSectio n 6.5.6 and Section 7.6) Any situation in which study participation might result in a safet y risk to the patient Adverse events for which continued exposure to the study drug would be detrimental Abnormal renal labor atory results requiring discontinuation (for guidance under which conditions a study drug discontinuation needs to be considered seeAppendix 3 ) Abnormal liver laboratory results requiring discontinuation (for furt her guidance under which conditions study drug di scontinuation should be considered see Appendix 2 ) Platelets < 75000/µL Unblinding of study treatment other than to authorized personnel (see Section 5.4 ) for any reason If a patient develops a medical condition that requires use of prohibited treatment as per Section 5.5.8, or if patient exhibits a behavior of non-compliance regarding prohibited medications Patient received a live virus vaccination during the study If a patient experiences an unexpected hypersensitivity reaction of grade 4, as defined by the World Allergy Organization Grading Sy stem ( Cox 2010 ), see Appendix 6 .  Lower or upper respiratory organs: Respiratory failure with or without loss of consciousness  Or cardiovascular s ystem: Hypotension with or without loss of consciousness Requireme nt of e mergency use of epinephrine (or a similar emergency intervention) due to anaph ylactic or anaph ylactoid reaction Any other protocol deviation that results in a significant risk to the patient ’s safet y The appropriate personnel from the site and Novar tis will assess whether investigational treatment should be discontinued for any patient whose treatment code has been broken inadvertentl y for an y reason. Patients who discontinue investigational treatment should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study . They will be expected to perform theend of treatment /study treatment discontinuation visit (EOT /TD) and all follow up visits. If the y fail to return for these assessments for unknown reasons, every effort (e.g., telephone, e-mail, letter) should be made to contact them and their legal guardians. The investigator must also contact the IRT to register the patient ’s discontinuation from investigational treatment."
36,page_36,"Novartis Confidential Page 37 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00 ) Protocol No. CQGE031C2202 If study drug discontinuation occurs because treatment code has been broken, please refer to Section 5.5.9 5.6.3 Withdrawal of informed consent Patients may voluntaril y withdraw consent to participate in the study for any reason at any time. Withdrawal of consent from the study is defined as when a patient: Does not want to participate in the study anymore and Does not want an y further visits or assessments and Does not want an y further study related contacts and Does not allow anal ysis of alr eady obtained biologic material In this situation, the investigator must make every effort (e.g. telephone, e-mail, letter) to determine the primary reason for the patient’s decision to withdraw his/her consent and record this information. Study treatment must be discontinued and no further assessments conducted, and the data that would have been collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing. Further attempts to contact the patient are not allowed unless safety findings require communicating or follow -up. All efforts should be made to complete the assessments prior to study withdrawal. A final evaluation at the time of the patient’s study withdrawal should be made as detailed inthe assessment table below . 5.6.4 Loss to follow -up For subjects whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to discontinue or withdraw, the investigator must show ""due diligence"" by documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the subject, e.g. dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. A patient cannot be considered as lost to follow -up until the time point of his/her planned end of study visit has passed. 5.6.5 Early study termination by the sponsor The study can be terminated by Novartis at any time fo r any reason. This may include reasons related to the benefit risk assessment of participating in the study , practical reasons, or for regulatory or medical reasons (including slow enrolment). Should this be necessary, the patient must be seen as soon as possible and treated as a prematur ely discontinued patient. The investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient’s interests. The investigator will be responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRBs/IECs) of the early termination of the trial."

Patients must be seen for all visits on the designated day, or as close to it as possible. Missed or rescheduled visits should not lead to automatic discontinuation. Patients who prematurel y discontinue the study for any reason should be scheduled for a visit as soon as possible, at which time all of the assessments listed for the final visit will be performed. At this final visit, all dispensed investigational product should be reconciled and the adverse event and concomitant medications reconciled on the CRF. All patients who complete the treatment period will be expected to attend all follow -up visits (Week 28 – Week 40). Patients who withdraw early will be contacted for safety evaluations every 4 weeks following their last study drug administration until 20 week s post withdrawal.

Adverse events that are not SAEs will be followed by the investigator and collected onl y in the source data. 6.2 Patient demographics/other baseline characteristics Patient demographi c and baseline characteristic data to be collected on all patients include age, sex, race, ethnicity . Relevant medical history /current medical condition present before signing the informed consent will be captured. Where possible, diagnoses, and not sympto ms, will be recorded. In addition, data on patient’s family history on malignancies is collected on the respective CRF page for those patients who during the trial experience an event related to any malignancies. 6.3 Treatment exposure and compliance Patients will receive onesubcutaneous injection every 4 weeks at six visits during the double - blind treatment period. Compliance is assured as study drug needs to be administered by independent unblinded study personnel via subcutaneous injection at the site. Administration of study drug should be recorded in the source documents and the correspondi ng CRF for each administration. 6.4 Efficacy The efficacy assessments consist of Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) that have been reported in the patient eDiary.

46,page_46,"Novartis Confidential Page 47 Clinical Trial Protocol (Vers ion 00) Protocol No. CQGE031C2202 The patients will receive clear instructions on the completion of the eDiary twice dail y or once daily depending on the questions. Sites and patients will receive appropriate training and guidance on the use of the eDiary device. Patients should be given sufficient space and time to complete all study PROs. If patients experience any difficulties with submission after they complete the PROs, the study staff should assist them with submitting their PRO responses. Attempts should be made to collect responses to all PROs for all patients, including from those who prematurel y discontinue prior to the study evaluation completion visit, however, if patients refuse to complete PROs, this should be documented in study source records. Patient’s refusal to complete study PROs are not protocol deviations. Completed questionnaires will be reviewed and examined by the investigator, before the clinical examination, for responses that may indicate potential adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs). The investigator should review not only the responses to the questions in the questionnaires but also for any unsolicited comments written by the patient. If AEs or SAEs are confirmed, then the physician must record the events as per instructions given in Section 7.1 andSection 7.2 of the protocol. 6.4.1.1 Urticaria Patient Daily D iary (UPDD) UPDD includes UAS7 (itch and hives) for clinical symptoms, angioedema occurrence and its management ( Appendix 3 ). 6.4.1.1.1 Hives Severity Score (HSS) Thewheals (hives) severity score, defined by number of hives, will be recorded by the patient twice daily in their eDiary, on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (intense/severe) (see Table 6-2). A weekl y score (HSS7) is derived b y adding up the average daily scores of the 7 days preceding the visit. The possible range of the weekl y score is therefore 0 – 21. Complete hives response is defined as HSS7 = 0. Table 6 -2 Hives S everity Score Score Wheals (Hives) 0 None 1 Mild (1-6 hives/12 hours) 2 M oderate (7 -12/12 hours) 3 Severe (>12 hives/12 hours) When either the morning or evening score is missing, the non-missing score for that day (morning or evening) will be used as the daily score. When one or more of the daily scores are missing, the following principles will be applied to handle the missing data: If a patient has at least 4 non-missing daily scores within the 7 days prior to the study visit, the weekly score is calculated as the sum of the available eDiary scores in that week, divided b y the number of day s that have a non -missing diary score, multiplied by 7."

A we ekly score (ISS7) is derived by adding up the average daily scores of the 7 days preceding the visit. The possible range of the weekl y score is therefore 0 –21. Partially missing diary entries will be handled in the same way as described for the hives sev erity score. Complete itch response is defined as ISS7 = 0.

Itwill also be deploy ed to any 17 year olds participating in this trial. It is a 10-item dermato logy- specific health -related quality of life measure. Patients rate their dermatology symptoms as well as the impact of their skin condition on various aspects of their lives. An overall score will be calculated as well as for the following domains: Sy mpto ms and Feelings, Leisure, School or Holiday s, Personal Relationships, Sleep, Treatment. The patient will complete this questionnaire on the eDiary at the hospital/clinic as per the assessment schedule in Table 6 -1. 6.4.3 Other assessments: In-clinic assessment of UAS The UAS will be recorded by the Investigator at the site by rating the patient’s number of urticaria lesion (hives) and interviewing the patient for the assessment of pruritus reflective of the patient’s condition over the 12 hours prior to the visit ( Table 6- 7). Table 6-7 In-clinic UA S Score Wheals (Hives) Score Pruritus (Itch) 0 None 0 None 1 Mild (1-6 hives/ 12 hours) 1 Mild 2 M oderate (7 -12/ 12 hours) 2 Moderate 3 Severe (>12 hives /12 hours) 3 S evere 6.4.4 Appropriateness of efficacy assessments The main CSU symptoms are hives and intense itch, therefore, it is appropriate to evaluate clinical response through use of the UAS, a composite endpoint that measures both of these symptoms. In the past literature has been noted that assessment of itch is the sy mptom of greatest concern to patients, with greatest impact on their quality oflife (Mathias et al 2010). However, hives are"
50,page_50,"Novartis Confidential Page 51 Clinical Trial Protocol (Vers ion 00) Protocol No. CQGE031C2202 more objective since they can be counted on the body and thus are more easily quantifiable , whereas the itch is asubjective, non- specific sensation which could be of different origin. Thus , in this study, the primary efficacy endpoint will be the combination of both weekl y hives and itch severity as covered by the UAS7 score. In addition each symptom score component (i.e. itch and hives score during the last seven days, I SS7 and HSS7 are analy zedas secondary endpoints. Disease recurrence after study drug is withdrawn will be measured during the post-treatment follow -up period . For all patients, sy mptom scores will be measured during both the treatment and post-treatment follow -up periods .The assessment of onset and offset of effect is also important to inform the model based analy sis that is plann ed based on the data set collected in this study . 6.5 Safet y Main safet y and tolerability assessments include: AEs and SAEs . AEs leading to treatment discontinuation ; Events of special interest areinjection site reactions, anaphy laxis, pre -malignancy /malignancy , cardio - cerebrovascular events Physical examination Vital signs Laboratory evaluations ECG 6.5.1 Physical examination A complete physical examination will include the examination of general appea rance, skin, neck (including thyroid), eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, extremities, vascular and neurological. If indicated based on medical history and/or s ymptoms, rectal, external genitalia, breast, and pelvic exams w ill be performed. A short phy sical exam will include the examination of general appearance and vital signs (see section 6.5.2). A short physical exam will be at all visits starting from the first screening visit except where a complete phy sical examination is required (see Table 6.1 ). Information for all phy sical examinations must be included in the source documentation at the study site. Significant findings that are present prior to signing informed consent must be included in the Medical History part of the CRF . Significant findings made after signing the informed consent which meet the definition of an Adverse Event must be recorded on the Adverse Event section of the CRF. 6.5.2 Vital sig ns Vital signs include blood pressure and pulse measurements. After the patient has been sitting for five minutes, with back supported and both feet placed on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured using a validated device with an appropriately sized cuff. In case the cuff sizes available are not large enough for the patient’s arm circumference, a sphy gmomanometer with an appropriatel y sized cuff may be used."

Details on the collections, shipment of samples and reporting of results by the central laboratory are provided to investigators in the laboratory manual. Clinically notable laboratory findings are defined in Appendix 1. 6.5.4.1 Hematology Hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) count with differential, and platelet count will be measured. Also coagulation will be assessed by Intern ational Normalized Ratio (INR). 6.5.4.2 Clinical chemistry Albumin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, chloride, calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, LDH, creatinine, inorganic phosphorus, urea/BUN, uric acid will be measured. Ifthe total bilirubin concentration is increased above 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, direct and indirect reacting bilirubin should be differentiated. 6.5.4.3 Urinaly sis Amidstream urine sample (approximately 30 mL ) will be obtained, in order to avoid contamination with epithelial cells and sediments, and allow proper assessments. If possible ,a morning sample should be used to eliminate benign orthosta tic(postural) proteinuria. Semi - quantitative “dipstick” evaluation for specific gravity , glucose, protein, bilirubin, ketones, leukocy tes and blood will be performed at site. When a dipstick evaluation is abnormal, e.g., positive for WBC and/or blood, a urine sample needs to be sent to the Central Lab for microscopic exam ination including RBC and WBC. Details on collection of urine for analy sis by central laboratory are provided to investig ators in the laboratory manual. 6.5.4.4 Assessment of parasitic infections Reduction in IgE levels may confer increased susceptibili ty to parasitic infections. The evidence of risk of acquiring or activating infections with helminthes is not confirmed and suspected to be low after treatment with anti- IgE such as ligelizumab and Omalizumab. As indicated in Section 4.2 (exclusion criteria), all patients will need to have a stool sample collected at screening. In case the patient is unable to provide a stool sample, they should take a sample pot home to bring or send in a stool sample as soon as possi ble after the visit, preferably the day after."
52,page_52,"Novartis Confidential Page 53 Clinical Trial Protocol (Vers ion 00) Protocol No. CQGE031C2202 Stool samples and additional assessment for parasitic disease will be examined for ova and parasites by the central laboratory . Negative tests must be documented before initiation of dosing. If diarrhea or other clinical sy mptom s or signs of helminth infection develop at any time prior to the last study drug administration, additional assessments for parasitic conditions need to be performed. A stool sample will also be collected at the end of study visit (EOS) . 6.5.5 Electrocardiogram (ECG) Standard 12 lead ECGs must be recorded after 10 minutes rest in the supine position to ensure a stable baseline. The preferred sequence of cardiovascular data collection during study visits is ECG collection first, followed by vital signs, and blood sampling. The Fridericia QT correction formula (QTcF) should be used for clinical decisions. Triplicate ECGs (3 ECG measurements taken at approximately 1 m in intervals) will be recorded at Visits 1 and 170; single ECGs will be recorded at all other visits where ECG is assessed. For each ECG performed, original traces and identical duplicate traces will be produced. The original trace will be sent electronically to the Contract Research Organization (CRO) directly from the provided ECG machine. Two “identical” duplicate print- outs will be generated and kept at the investigator site as source documentation and as back -up for submission to the vendor in case of problems with the electronic transmission. The “identical” duplicates kept at th e investigator site will be dated and signed and will be archived at the study site. The patient’s number, the date and actual time of the tracing, and Study Code (CQGE031C2202) must appear on each page of the ECG tracing. Clinically significant ECG findin gs prior to dosing with investigational treatment must be discussed with the sponsor. Clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded on the relevant section of the Medical history /Current medical conditions/AE CRF page, as appropriate. Full detail s of all procedures relating to the ECG collection and reporting will be contained in an investigator manual to be provided by the CRO to each investigator site. 6.5.6 Pregnancy and assessments of fertility Females of child -bearing potential are defined as all females physiologically capable of becoming pregnant. This includes female adolescent patients who have had their menarche or who expe rience their menarche during the study . A urine pregnancy test and aserum B-hCG will be performed for all females of child -bearing potential according to the schedule in Table 6-1. A positive urine pregnancy test requires immediate interruption of study medication until serum B-hCG is performed and found to be negative. If positive, the patient must be discontinued from the investigational treatment. However, a patient may choose to remain in the study should she become pregnant, and be followed according to the protocol -defined study visits.

A single blood collection will account for ligelizumab and total IgE. Where sample collections coincide with dosage administration then the blood sample must be taken immediately before the dose is administered. Serum IgE levels will also be assessed prior to study drug administration at randomization visit (Visit 110).

Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causall y associated with the use of a medicin al (investigational) product. The investigator has the responsibility for managing the safet y of individual subject and identify ing adverse events. Novartis qualified medical personnel will be readily available to advise on trial related medical questions or problems. The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by non -directive questioning of the subject at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered b y the subject during or between visits or through physical examination findings, laboratory test findings, or other assessments. Adverse events must be recorded under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with them, accompanied by the following information (as far as possible) (if the event is serious refer to Section 7.2): 1.The severit y grade . -mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities -moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities -severe: preve nts normal activities 2.its relationship to the study treatment. If the event is due to lack of efficacy or progression of underl ying illness (i.e. progression of the study indication) the assessment of causalit y will usually be ‘Not suspected’. The rationa le for this guidance is that the sy mptoms of a lack of efficacy or progression of underly ing illness are not caused by the trial drug, they happen in spite of its administration and/or both lack of efficacy and progression of underly ing disease can only beevaluated meaningfull y by an anal ysis of cohorts, not on a single subject 3.its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing, an outcome of not recovered/not resolved must be reported."

All adverse events must be treated appropriately . Treatment may include one or more of the following: -Dose not changed -Dose Reduced/increased -Drug interrupted/withdrawn 6.its outcome i.e., its recovery status or whether it was fatal Conditions that were alread y present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in medical history of the subject. Adverse events (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underly ing signs and s ymptoms. Adverse event monitoring should be continued for at least 30 days following the last dose of study treatment. Once an adverse event is detected, it must be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent (e.g. Continuing at the end of the study ), and assessment must be made at each visit (or more frequently, if necessary) of an y changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. Information about adverse drug reactions for the investigational drug can be found in the Investigator ’sBrochure (IB). Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria: -they induce clinical signs or sy mptoms -they are considered clinically significant -they require therapy Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results must be identified through a review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non -typical in subjects with the underl ying disea se. Alert ranges for laboratory and other test abnormalities are included in Appendix 1 . 7.2 Serious adverse events 7.2.1 Definition of SA E An SAE is defined as any adverse event (appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing)) undesirable sign(s), symptom(s) or medical conditions(s) which meets any one of the following criteria: fatal life-threatening"
57,page_57,"Novartis Confidential Page 58 Clinical Trial Protocol (Vers ion 00) Protocol No. CQGE031C2202 Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (please refer to the I CH-E2D Guidelines). results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity constitutes a congenital anomaly /birth def ect requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless hospitalization is for: routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition elective or pre -planned treat ment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the subject’s general condition treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission is medically significant, e.g. defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but might jeopardize the subject or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Such events should be considered as “medicall y significant”. Examples of such events are intens ive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse (please refer to the Annex IV, ICH-E2D Guidelines) . All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other seriousness criteria are not met. Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction. All reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered serious adverse event irrespective if a clinical event has occurred. 7.2.2 SAE reporting To ensure patient safet y, every SAE, regardless of causalit y, occurring after the patient has provided informed consent and until 30 days after the last study visitmust be reported to Novartis safet y within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Any SAEs experienced after the 30 day period after the last study visitshould only be reported to Novartis safet y if the investigat or suspects a causal relationship to study treatment. All follow -up information for the SAE including information on complications, progression of the initial SAE and recurrent episodes must be reported as follow -up to the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE occurring at a"
58,page_58,"Novartis Confidential Page 59 Clinical Trial Protocol (Vers ion 00) Protocol No. CQGE031C2202 different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one must be reported separatel y as a new event. Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically thorough report. The investigator must assess the relationship of each SAE to each specific component of study treatment, (if study treatment consists of several components) complete the SAE Report Form in English, and submit the completed form within 24 hours to Novartis. Detailed instructions regarding the submission process and requirements for signature are to be found in the investigator folder provided to each site. Follow -up information is submitted as instructed in the investigator folder. Each re-occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event must be reported as a follow -up to that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow -up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not, and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation. Ifthe SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study treatment a Drug Safety and Epidemiolog y Department associate may urgentl y require further information from th e investigator for health authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same study treatment that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Advers e Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with EU Guidance 2011/C 172/01 or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries. Note: SAEs must be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of the investigator learning of its occurrence/receiving follow -up information. 7.3 Liver safet y monitoring To ensure patient safet y and enhance reliability in determining the hepatotoxic potential of an investigational drug, a standardized process for identification, monitoring and evaluation of liver events has to be followed. The following two categories of abnormalities / adverse events have to be considered during the course of the study (irrespective of whether classified/reported as AE/SAE): Liver laboratory triggers, which will require repeated assessments of the abnormal laboratory parameter Liver events, which will require close observation, follow- up monitoring and contributing factors are recorded on the appropriate CRFs Please refer to Table 13.1 in Appendix 2for complete definitions of liver laboratory triggers and liver events. Every liver event defined in Table 13.1 should be followed up by the investigator or designated personnel at t he trial site, as summarized below. Additional details on actions required in case of liver events are outlined inTable 13.2. Repeat liver chemistry tests (ALT, AST, TBL, PT/INR, ALP and G -GT) to confirm elevation."
59,page_59,"Novartis Confidential Page 60 Clinical Trial Protocol (Vers ion 00) Protocol No. CQGE031C2202 These liver chemistry repeats will be performed using the central laboratory. If results will not be available from the central laboratory , then the repeats can also be performe d at a local laboratory to monitor the safet y of the subject. If a liver event is subsequently reported, an y local liver chemistry tests previously conducted that are associated with this event should have results recorded on the appropriate CRF. If the initial elevation is confirmed, close observation of the subject will be initiated, including consideration of treatment interruption if deemed appropriate. Discontinuation of the investigational drug (refer to the Discontinuation of study treatment section) , if appropriate Hospitalization of the subject if appropriate Causality assessment of the liver event These investigations can include based on investigator’s discretion: serology tests, imaging and pathology assessments, hepatologist’s consultancy ; obtaining more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases, history of concomitant drug use, exclusion of underly ing liver disease All follow -up information, and the procedures performed must be recorded as appropriate in the CRF. 7.4 Renal safety monitoring Routine renal safety monitoring includes the asses sment of creatinine, BUN , urine dipstick measurements. e GFR will be calculated using the Schwartz formula. For diagnosis and actions related to renal adverse events pl ease refer to Appendix 3 . 7.5 Reporting of study treatment errors including misuse/abuse Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration or monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, patient or consumer (EMA definition). Misuse refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriatel y used not in accordance with the protocol. Abuse corresponds to the persistent or sporadic , intentional excessive use of a medicinal product, which is accompanied b y harmful ph ysical or ps ychological effects. Study treatment errors and uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol will be collected in the appropriate CRF, irrespective of whe ther or not associated with an AE/SAE and reported to Safety only if associated with an SAE. Misuse or abuse will be collected and reported in the safet y database irrespective of it being associated with an AE/SAE."

The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. The newborn will be followed up to 3 months after the birth to collect an y information on any development issue that would not be seen at birth. Pregnancy must be recorded on the Pharmacovigilance Pregnancy Form and reported by the investigator to the local Novartis Drug Safet y and Epidemiology Department. Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the stud y treatment. Any SAE experienced during the pregnancy and unrelated to the pregnancy must be reported on a SAE form. 7.7 Other safety assessments 7.7.1 Immunogenicity assessmen ts The presence of anti-QGE031 antibodies will be determined in samples collected prior to the first dose and on Week 8, 16, 24, 32 and 40. The presence of anti-QGE031 antibodies will be assay ed using a MSD -based homogenous bridging assay . In this assay anti-QGE031 antibodies are captured in solution by combination of biotiny lated and rutheniu m-labeled forms of ligelizumab . Formed complex is subsequentl y detected by the ECL using streptavidin coated plates (MSD). Interference of endogenous IgE will be minimized by pre-treatment with an anti-IgE antibody coupled to magnetic beads to remove IgE and interference with ligelizumab will be minimized by an acid-treatment step to disrupt pre-existing anti-QGE031 -QGE031 complexes. The detailed method to assess immunogenicit y will be described in the bioanaly tical raw data of the study and in the bioanaly tical data report."

During the study , Novartis employ s several methods of ensuring protocol and GCP compliance and the quality /integrity of the sites’ data. The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of data capture / data entry , the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specificati ons. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each site’s data may be performed by a centralized Novartis CRA organization. Additionally , a central analytics organization may analyze data & identify risks & trends for site operational parameters, and provide reports to Novartis Clinical Teams to assist with trial oversight. The investigator must maintain source documents for each patient in the study , consisting of case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information on CRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the patient's file. Data not requiring a separate written record will be defined before stud y start and will be recorded directl y on the CRFs. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed b y the patient (a signed cop y is given to the patient). The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their consistency with the data capture and/or data entry . Novartis monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, a dherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study - specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the patients/subjects will be disclosed. 8.2 Data collection Designated investigator staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF). The eCRFs have been built using fully validated secure web- enabled software that conforms to 21 CFR Part 11 requirements, Investigator site staff will not be given access to the EDC system until they have been trained. Automatic validation programs check for data discrepan cies in the eCRFs, allow modification and/or verification of the entered data b y the investigator staff. The investigator/designee is responsible for assuring that the data (recorded on CRFs) (entered into eCRF) is complete, accurate, and that entry and updates are performed in a timely manner. The Investigator must certify that the data entered are complete and accurate After final database lock, the investigator will receive copies of the subject data for archiving at the investigational site."
62,page_62,"Novartis Confidential Page 63 Clinical Trial Protocol (Vers ion 00) Protocol No. CQGE031C2202 8.3 Database ma nagement and quality control Novartis personnel (or designated CRO) will review the data entered by investigational staff for completeness and accuracy . Electronic data queries stating the nature of the problem and requesting clarification will be created for discrepancies and missing values and sent to the investigational site via the EDC system. Designated investigator site staff is required to respond promptly to queries and to make an y necessary changes to the data. Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug Reference List, which employ s the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Concomitant procedures, non-drug therapies and adverse events will be coded using the Medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) terminology . Laboratory samples will be processed centrall y and the results will be sent electronicall y to Novartis (or a designated CRO). ECG readings will be processed centrall y and the results will be sent electronically to Novartis (or a designated CRO). Diary data will be entered into an electronic diary . The sy stem will be supplied by a vendor(s), who will also manage the database. The database will be sent electronically to Novartis personnel (or designated CRO). Randomization codes and data about all study drug(s) dispensed to the patient and all dosage changes will be tracked using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT). The system will be supplied by a vendor, who will also manage the database. The data will be sent electroni cally to Novartis (or a designated CRO). Each occurrence of a code break via IRT will be reported to the clinical team and monitor. The code break functionality will remain available until study shut down or upon request of Novartis. The occurrence of relevant protocol deviations will be determined. After these actions have been completed and the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, it will be locked and the treatment codes will be unblinded and made available for data analysis. Any changes to the database after that time can only be made after written agreement by Novartis Development management. 8.4 Data Monitoring Committee This study will include a data monitoring committee (DMC) which will function independentl y of all other individual s associated with the conduct of this clinical trial, including the site investigators participating in the study . The DMC will assess at defined intervals the progress of a clinical trial, safet y data, and critical efficacy variables and recommend to the sponsor whether to continue, modify or terminate a trial. Specific details regarding composition, responsibilities, data monitoring and meeting frequency , and documentation of DMC reports, minutes, and recommendations will be described in a separate charte r that is established between the sponsor and the DMC."
63,page_63,"Novartis Confidential Page 64 Clinical Trial Protocol (Vers ion 00) Protocol No. CQGE031C2202 8.5 Adjudication Committee The role of the Adjudication Committee (AC) is to ensure that all treatment outcomes are judged uniformly , using standard criteria and processes. The AC will be composed of clin ical experts to evaluate disease progression and harmonize endpoint assessment criteria using data provided by the sponsor. All personnel involved in the adjudication process will remain blinded to treatment allocation throughout the trial. Specific detail s regarding endpoint definitions can be found in the adjudication charter. 9 Data analy sis The analy sis will be conducted on all patient data at the time the trial ends. Any data analysis carried out independently by the investigator should be submitted to Novartis before publication or presentation. 9.1 Analysis sets The randomized set (RAN), which comprises all randomized patients, regardless of whether or not they actuall y received study medication, will be used for summaries of patient disposition and analysis sets. The Full Anal ysis set (FAS) comprises all patients to whom study treatment has been assigned. Following the intent -to-treat principle, patients will be analy zed according to the treatment they were assigned to at randomization. FAS will be used for all efficacy variables, unless otherwise stated. The safet y set (SAF) will include all patients who received at least one dose of study drug whether or not being randomized. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they received. The sa fety set will be used in the anal ysis of all safet y variables. Note that the FAS and safety set are the same except that the safety set allows the inclusion of non-randomized patients who receive study drug in error. Also the FAS assigns randomized treatm ent and the safet y set assigns received treatment. 9.2 Patient demographics and other baseline characteristics Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized using the safet y set including disease characteristics, prior and background medicati ons to treat urticaria, and relevant medical histories. 9.3 Treatments The number of patients and the length of time (in days) exposed to each study drug and dose will be summarized by treatment for the safet y set. Concomitant medications will be summarized by treatment for the safety set separated for urticaria related background medications and non-urticaria related medications.

Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by the investigator must be agreed to by Novartis before submission to the IRB/IE C, and a copy of the approved version must be provided to the Novartis monitor after IRB/ IEC approval. Females of child bearing potential must be informed that taking the study treatment may involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement for the duration of the study . If there is any question that the patient will not reliably compl y, they must not be entered in the stud y. 10.3 Responsibilities of the investigator and IRB/IEC Before initiating a trial, the investigator/institution should obtain approval/favorable opinion from the IRB/IEC for the trial protocol, written informed consent form, consent form updates, patient recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements) and any other written information to be provided to patients. Prior to study start, the investigator is required to sign a protocol signature page confirming his/her agreement to conduct the study in accordance with these documents and all of the instructions and procedures found in this protocol and to give access to allrelevant data and records to Novartis monitors, auditors, Novartis Qualit y Assurance representatives, designated agents of Novartis, IRBs/IECs, and regulatory authorities as required. If an inspection of the clinical site is requested by a regulatory authority, the investigator must inform Novartis immediately that this request has been made. Before initiating a trial, the investigator/institution must obtain approval/favorable opinion from the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (I RB/I EC) for the trial protocol,"

Prior to study start, the investigator is required to sign a protocol signature page confirming his/her agreement to conduct the study in accordance with these documents and all of the instructions and procedures found in this protocol and to give access to all relevant data and records to Novarti s monitors, auditors, Novartis Qualit y Assurance representatives, designated agents of Novartis, IRBs/IECs, and regulatory authorities as required. If an inspection of the clinical site is requested by a regulatory authorit y, the investigator must inform Novartis immediately that this request has been made. 10.4 Publication of study protocol and results The key design elements of this protocol will be posted in a publicly accessible database such as clinicaltrials.gov. In addition, upon study completion and fin alization of the study report the results of this trial will be either submitted for publication and/or posted in a publicly accessible database of clinical trial results. 10.5 Qualit y Control and Quality Assurance Novartis maintains a robust Quality Managemen t (QM) system that includes all activities involved in quality assurance and qualit y control, including the assignment of roles and responsibilities, the reporting of results, and the documentation of actions and escalation of issues identified during the review of qualit y metrics, incidents, audits and inspections. Audits of investigator sites, vendors, and Novartis sy stems are performed by Novartis Pharma Auditing and Compliance Quality Assurance, a group independent from those involved in conducting, monitoring or performing quality control of the clinical trial. The clinical audit process uses a knowledge/risk based approach. Audits are conducted to assess GCP compliance with global and local regulatory requirements, protocols and internal standard opera ting procedures (SOP), and are performed according to written Novartis processes. 11 Protocol adherence This protocol defines the study objectives, the study procedures and the data to be collected on study participants. Additional assessments required to ensure safet y of patients/subjects should be administered as deemed necessary on a case by case basis. Under no circumstances including incidental collection is an investigator allowed to collect additional data or conduct any additional procedures for any purpose involving any investigational drugs under the protocol , other than the purpose of the study . If despite this interdiction, data, information, observation would be incidentally collected, the investigator shall immediately disclose it to Novartis and not use it for any purpose other than the study , except for the appropriate monitoring on study participants. Investigators ascertain they will apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations. If an investigator feels a protocol deviation would improve the conduct of the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment is agreed upon by Novartis and approved by the IR B/IEC and health authorities, where required, it cannot be implemented."
71,page_71,"Novartis Confidential Page 72 Clinical Trial Protocol (Vers ion 00) Protocol No. CQGE031C2202 11.1 Protocol a mendments Any change or a ddition to the protocol can onl y be made in a written protocol amendment that must be approved by Novartis, health authorities where required, and the IRB/IEC prior to implementation. Only amendments that are intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients/subjects may be implemented immediately provided the health authorities are subsequently notified by protocol amendment and the reviewing IRB/IEC is notified. Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal protocol amendments, the investigator is expected to take any immediate action required for the safet y of any patient included in this study , even if this action represents a deviation from the protocol. In such cases, the reporting requirements identified in Section 7 Safety Monitoring must be followed."
