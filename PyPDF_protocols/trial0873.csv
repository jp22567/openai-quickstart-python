Study design This is a 52 -week multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group trial in approximately 120 subjects with moderate to severe plaque -type psoriasis. The study consists of 3 periods: Screening Period (of at least 1 week and up to 4 weeks), Treatment Period 1 (12 weeks) and Treatment Period 2 (40 weeks). Subjects will be randomized using a 2:2:1:1 ratio to the following groups following a stratification by body weight (< 90 .kg or ≥ 90 kg): secukinumab 300 mg regimen group (2 mL auto -injector), secukinumab 300 mg regimen group (2 x 1 mL pre -filled syringes (PFS)). Placebo – Secukinumab 300 mg (2 mL AI) or to Placebo – Secukinumab 300 mg (2 x 1mL PFS). The treatment of the 2 placebo gr oups will be the same during treatment Period 1 and will only differ after Week 12 in treatment period 2 for non -responders only. Prior to administration of the Week 12 dose, PASI 90 response will be evaluated and subjects classified accordingly. Based on the PASI 90 responders at the Week 12 visit, subjects on placebo will either remain on placebo during the Treatment Period 2 or be re -assigned to secukinumab 300 mg treatment (2 mL AI or 2 x 1mL PFS). Population Approximately 120 subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will be randomized in approximately 30 centers worldwide. Approximately 150 subjects are expected to be screened to provide the number of randomized subjects. Key Inclusion criteria 1.

15,page_15,"Novartis Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Confidential Page 16 0 Protocol No. CAIN457A2325 1 Introduction 1.1 Background Psoriasis is a chronic relapsing disease of the skin characterized by variable clinical features. The lesions are classified as erythemato -squamous, which indicates that both the vasculature (erythema) and the epidermis (increased scale formation) are invo lved ( Christophers and Mrowietz 2003, Griffiths and Barker JNWN 2007 ). Plaque -type psoriasis (also called plaque or chronic plaque psoriasis) is the most frequent clinical presentation and there fore, also called psoriasis vulgaris. The erythematous plaques are well defined with sharp borders. The silvery grey scale on the surface of the lesions is easily removed. Sharply demarcated lesions can present on the extensor surfaces of the knees and elbows and on the trunk. Lesions are often symmetrically distribut ed. The size of the lesions is highly variable. In approximately one -third of patients, more than 10% of the body is covered, and this is termed moderate to severe psoriasis. Clinical disease can be assessed by a trained healthcare practitioner, using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score. This tool ranks severity and area of erythema (redness), induration (thickness), and desquamation (scale) of the plaques in different body sections, with 72 as the maximal score. PASI score of at least 12 is required to classify for moderate to severe psoriasis. Treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis is based on phototherapy, systemic treatment (eg, methotrexate, cyclosporine, acitretin, apremilast) and biologics. The introduction of tumor necrosis factor a lpha (TNFα) -inhibitors such as etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab, increased treatment options for physicians. The primary indication for these biological products is the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis not responding satisfactorily to convent ional treatment such as phototherapy, methotrexate or acitretin. Extensive clinical experience with TNFα -inhibitors has been collected over the past 10 years and these agents are generally considered to be effective and relatively safe ( Papp et al 2005 ). However, a substantial percentage of patients do not respond well to treatment with a TNFα - inhibitor. This inadequate response may imply either a primary unsatisfactory response (eg, not achieving a decrease in PASI score of at least 75% after adequate duration of treatment), an initially adequate response that is lost over time (secondary failure) or intolerance for the TNFα - inhibitor. The percentage of patients with an inadequate re sponse to TNFα -inhibitors can be as high as 40% -60% ( Van Lümig et al 2010 ). The arrival of the anti -Interleukin (IL) 12/23 class of biological drugs provided clinicians with another treatment option ( Kerdel and Zaiac 2015 ). Ustekinumab has shown good clinical efficacy in a Phase III study ( Papp et al 2008 ). PASI response rates were better than those of etanercept, and efficacy was generally maintained up to 3 years after initiation of treatment (Kimball et al 2012 ). More recently, a number of IL-17A and IL-17RA inhibitors have been investigated in Phase III studies for the treatment of a range of immune mediated inflammatory diseases ( Puig 2014 ) amongst which ixekizumab and brodalumab have been approved in 2017 in USA for moderate to severe psoriasis patients. Secukinumab (AIN457) is a recombinant high-affinity fully human monoclonal anti-human IL- 17A antibody of the immunoglobulin (Ig) G1/κ -class. Secukinumab binds to human IL-17A"
16,page_16,"Novartis Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Confidential Page 17 0 Protocol No. CAIN457A2325 and neutralizes the bioactivity of this cytokine. IL-17A is the central cytokine of a newly defined subset of inflammatory T cells, the T helper 17 cells which, in several animal models, are pivotal in multiple autoimmune and inflammatory processes. IL -17A is produced by memory effector CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, but also largely by innate immune cells (including neutrophils, mast cells, γδ -T cells, ILC3 cells, NK and iNKT cells), and is being recognized as one of the principal pro inflammatory cytokines in immune mediated inflammatory diseases. Its neutralization is expected to treat the underlying pathophysiology of immune mediated disease, and as a consequence provide relief of (psoriatic) symptoms. Secukinumab has been shown to be superior to etanercept ( Langley et al 2014 ) and superior to ustekinumab ( Thaci et al 2015 ) in clearing skin of subject with moderate to severe psoriasis with a comparable safety profile. Secukinumab has a different mode of action to TNFα -inhibitors and IL -12/23 inhibitors as it targets a different interleukin (i.e., IL -17A). Secukinumab (Cosentyx®) with a recommended dose of 300 mg was approved in 2014 in Japan, and 2015 in USA, EU, Switzerland, and in many other countries for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis in adults. Secukinumab is available as a powder for sol ution for injection, and as a solution of 150 mg in 1 mL for injection using pre -filled syringe or a pen/auto -injector (AI). Currently two injections (each with 150 mg) for the recommended dose (300 mg) are required. In order to allow patients to receive o nly one injection for the delivery of secukinumab 300 mg instead of two injections of 150 mg, Novartis is currently developing the 2 mL pre-filled syringe and the 2 mL auto-injector containing 300 mg of secukinumab. As of 25 June 2017, over 28 000 subjects have been enrolled in studies with secukinumab, with over 25000 having received secukinumab at doses ranging from 0.1 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.), and from 25 mg to 300 mg subcutaneously (s.c.), given as single or multiple doses. As of 25 June 2017, there are over 50 completed and multiple ongoing trials conducted with secukinumab in indications including psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), ankylosing spondylitis, uveitis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, rheumatic polymyalgia , type I diabetes mellitus, and asthma. These studies support a favorable safety profile without indication of any specific organ toxicity. The Novartis Investigator’s Brochure (IB) provides a more detailed review of the pre -clinical and clinical informati on on secukinumab. The aim of the present study is to assess the efficacy, safety, and local tolerability of a 2 mL auto -injector of 300 mg secukinumab. 1.2 Purpose The purpose of this study is to demonstrate efficacy of secukinumab 300 mg in 2 mL auto - injector at Week 12 based on PASI and IGA mod 2011 response rates versus placebo in subjects with moderate to severe plaque -type psoriasis. Moreover this study will as sess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of secukinumab when used for 52 weeks as well as usability (ability to follow instruction for use and potential use -related hazards) of the 2 mL AI. As a result, this study will provide efficacy, and safety data ( ) to support the registration of the secukinumab 300 mg in 2 mL AI."

It is expected that subjects will be enrolled at around 30 study sites worldwide. The study consists of 3 periods: • Screening Period (of at least 1 week and up to 4 weeks between Screening and Randomization) The screening period is used to assess eligibility of the subjects and to taper subjects off prohibited medications. • Treatment Period 1 (of 12 weeks, double -blind between Randomization and Week 12 pre - dose) The Treatment Period 1 starts with the randomiza tion of eligible subjects followed by the first dosing. At the start of Treatment Period I, eligible subjects will be randomized at a 2:2:1:1 ratio to one of the four treatment groups ( Section 6.1.1 ). In order to achieve a balanced weight distribution in each treatment arm, randomization in these four groups will be stratified by body weight at baseline (< 90 kg or ≥ 90 kg). Subjects are then visiting the study site at Week 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 12, wher e they will receive study treatment (secukinumab 300 mg 2 mL AI, secukinumab 300 mg 2 x 1mL PFS, or placebo)."

This time -point is the End of Treat ment Period 1 (EOT1). • Treatment Period 2 (of 40 weeks, double -blind between Week 12 dosing and Week 52) The Treatment Period 2 is a maintenance period for the study treatment and starts with the Week 12 dosing. Doses of study treatment are then self-administered weekly up to Week 16 and every four weeks up to Week 48 for all treatment arms. Week 52 is the planned End of Treatment Period 2/End of Study (EOT2/EOS). Subjects who prematurely discontinue study treatment must perform EOT1 or EOT2/EOS approximately four weeks after their last dose of study treatment, depending if they are in Treatment Period 1 or 2, respectively.

20,page_20,"Novartis Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Confidential Page 21 0 Protocol No. CAIN457A2325 This 52-week, double -blind, randomized, parallel -group, and placebo -controlled study is using the recommended dose of 300 mg secukinumab which has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis in adults. The study has been designed in accordance with Health Authorities guidelines and feedback on the clinical development program for the 2 mL auto -injector, including the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The principle of a 2 mL s.c. injection is supported by a patient education document published by the National Institute of Health ( NIH) that outlines the possibility to administer more than 1 mL of volume ( NIH 2016 ). Based upon a recently conducted No vartis relative bioavailability study (CAIN457A2107) that assessed the 300 mg dose with a 2 mL s.c. injection using different devices, the pharmacokinetic data with 2 mL s.c. were similar to two marketed forms of 1 mL s.c. (pre -filled syringe and auto -injector/pen) and safety data showed no issues with 2 mL s.c. injections, including local tolerability. Therefore, it is appropriate to initiate study CAIN457A2325. The primary endpoint of this study is at Week 12. This will allow for assessment of efficacy at a point in time for which efficacy data of current approved biologic therapies are available and which was the primary endpoint for the phase III studies with secukinumab in psoriasis, including those studies that introduced the liquid formulations (1 mL pre-filled syringe in CAIN457A2308, and 1 mL auto -injector in CAIN457A2309; Blauvelt et al 2014 , Paul C et al 2015 ). Overall, this study will assess the efficacy, safety ( ) and tolerability of secukinumab when used both, short -term (up to 12 weeks) and long -term (up to 52 weeks) and includes an usabilit y and satisfaction assessment (ability to follow instruction for use and potential use -related hazards) and satisfaction) of secukinumab with a 2 mL auto - injector. These data will support the registration of secukinumab 300 mg 2 mL auto -injector. The subj ect population will be described in more detail in Section 5 below. 4.2 Rationale for dose/regimen and duration of treatment The placebo -controlled study design was chosen to demonstrate the efficacy of 300 mg secukinumab administered with a 2 mL auto-injector in adult subjects suffering from moderate to severe psoriasis compared to placebo. The selected dose regimen for this study with an initial weekly schedule up to 4 weeks followed by a s.c administration of every four weeks up to Week 48 is in line with the posology and method of administration as described in the approved product labelling. The selected design with the two injections of secukinumab 1 mL pre -filled syringes will also allow the comparison of the and safety profil e with the secukinumab 300 mg 2 mL auto-injector. 4.3 Rationale for choice of comparator Due to the nature of psoriasis and the outcome measures for the primary and the key secondary endpoints used (PASI 75, 90 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1), a placebo arm is necessary for reliable results on efficacy and safety. Moreover, the inclusion of a placebo group is in accordance with health authority guidelines ( CHMP Psoriasis Guideline 2004 ). The duration of 3 months treatment within the placebo group up to the primary endpoint at Week 12 is accepted for"

Subjects from the placebo group that will not achieve PASI 90 after Week 12 will re ceive secukinumab. An arm with secukinumab 300 mg as 2 injections of 1 mL PFS has been added to assess and as a reference for comparisons of efficacy and safety with secukinumab 300 mg 2 mL AI. 4.4 Purpose and timing of interim analyses/desig n adaptations An analysis is planned to be performed after all subjects have completed the Week 16 visit to assess the data up to Week 16 with the coprimary endpoints. All data up to Week 16 will be collected with the clinical team being blinded. The de signated Novartis personnel (eg, statistician, programmer and a clinical representative) will be unblinded following database lock for the Week 16 analysis after all subjects have completed Week 16. Investigators, site personnel, and subjects will remain b linded until the end of the study. It is planned that data from the Week 16 analysis will be used for submission to the Health Authorities. Trial modifications are not planned based on any Week 16 analysis. Additional analyses are not planned, they may be performed to support Health Authorities interactions, as necessary. 4.5 Risks and benefits Secukinumab (Cosentyx®) 300 mg has been approved in moderate to severe psoriasis based on substantial clinical benefit and a favorable safety profile. Approximately 4,000 patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were included in studies in the registration program. This included 3,430 subjects treated with secukinumab in 10 phase II/III studies, 2,727 of whom were treated for at least 6 months and 2,029 of whom were treated for at least 48 weeks. Superiority of secukinumab to placebo was demonstrated for the co-primary efficacy criteria of PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 at 12 weeks in all 4 pivotal placebo -controlled trials (> 62% for PASI 75 and > 48% for IGA mod 2011 0 or 1). Secukinumab was also found to be superior in efficacy compared to etanercept with a rapid onset of action in the etanercept and placebo - controlled studies, CAIN457A2302 and C AIN457A2303 and superior to ustekinumab in CAIN457A2317. The safety data from the completed and ongoing studies including AE and SAE data, laboratory parameters and data demonstrate a favorable safety profile. Observed risks included infecti ons in particular upper respiratory tract infections, neutropenia and hypersensitivity reactions that can be seen with administration of foreign proteins. Most of the infections were non-serious, mild to moderate in severity, clinically easily manageable a nd did not lead to treatment discontinuation. Cases of neutropenia were uncommon, generally mild to moderate and transient and did not lead to treatment discontinuation, and only a few cases were temporally associated with non -serious infections. Subjects with pre -existing malignancies within the past 5 years are generally excluded from studies with secukinumab although there is no scientific basis to suggest that secukinumab would increase the risk for malignancies. Indeed, the majority of preclin ical data, available in the literature, suggest that blocking IL -17A may actually prevent tumor growth."
22,page_22,"Novartis Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Confidential Page 23 0 Protocol No. CAIN457A2325 Indirect comparisons across phase III trials revealed that fewer injection site reactions were reported with secukinumab 1 mL pre -filled syringe (containing 150 mg secukinumab), compared to etanercept, while the active treatment groups were higher vs. placebo. In the phase III studies CAIN457A2308 and CAIN457A2309, evaluating the safety and efficacy of secukinumab in liquid formulation in t he 1 mL pre -filled syringe and 1 mL pre -filled pen/auto -injector, respectively, the data showed that the PASI response with both 150 mg and 300 mg doses were superior to placebo (p < 0.0001). Comparing the efficacy and safety results across the phase III t rials, the response rates in trials A2308 and A2309 were generally similar to those of the trials involving the lyophilized form (studies A2302 and A2303). It is expected that the 2 mL pre -filled syringe and 2 mL pre -filled pen/auto -injector are also compa rable and have the same efficacy and safety profile as the liquid formulation remains the same. A recent relative bioavailability study (CAIN457A2107) to assess the pharmacokinetic parameters, safety and tolerability of a single administration of 300 mg se cukinumab administered subcutaneously (s.c.) in healthy volunteers investigated several delivery systems to identify administration options for secukinumab. The data suggest that with a “simulated” 2 mL pre -filled syringe (i.e.,. manual injection of 2 mL 3 00 mg in 10 seconds) i/ the pharmacokinetic profiles are similar to the 1 mL pre -filled syringe (with 2 injections), ii/ the tolerability (pain score) is acceptable, iii/ local reactions such as erythema, induration, hemorrhage, pruritus and leakage are minimum and finally, iv/ the safety profile is also similar to the 1 mL pre -filled syringe (with 2 x 1 mL s.c. injections). The 2 mL “simulated” form represented the best option from that study to provide the subjects with a simple easy to use single -injection device for the treatment of psoriasis. The principle of a 2 mL s.c. injection in patients is supported by the Patient Education document from the US National Institute of Health ( NIH) that outlines the possibility to administer more than 1 mL of volume ( NIH 2016 ). All quality, non -clinical pharmacology and toxicology data, as well as the available clinical efficacy and safety data, are considered sufficient to expect a positive benefit/risk ratio for the treatment of psoriasis with secukinumab with the 2 mL 300 mg a uto-injector, and therefore it is appropriate to initiate study CAIN457A2325 for registration purposes. The risk to subjects in this trial will be minimized by compliance with the eligibility criteria and study procedures, and close clinical monitoring Wom en of child bearing potential and sexually active males must be informed that taking the study treatment may involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study, and agree that in order to participate in the study they must adher e to the contraception requirements outlined in the exclusion criteria. If there is any question that the subject will not reliably comply, they should not be entered or continue in the study. 5 Population Approximately 120 subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will be randomized in approximately 30 centers worldwide. Approximately 150 subjects are expected to be screened to provide the number of randomized subjects. Drop -outs after randomization will not be replaced."

Any treatment known to worsen psoriasis (eg, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, lithium) should be stab le at least 4 weeks before randomization. 6.2.2 Prohibited medication Use of any treatments displayed in Table 6 -1 that could confound the efficacy of the investigational drug is NOT allowed during the study for any indication. Al l prohibited treatments should be washed out as shown in Table 6 -1. The investigator should instruct the subject to notify the study site about any new treatments. At the discretion of the investigator, if any use of a prohib ited treatment presents an undue safety risk for the subject, the study treatment must be discontinued. If a live vaccination has to be administered, the study treatment must be discontinued.

The Subject No. consists of the Center Number (Center No.) (as assigned by Novartis to the investigative site) with a sequential subject number suffixed to it, so that each subject is numbered uniquely across the entire database."
30,page_30,"Novartis Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Confidential Page 31 0 Protocol No. CAIN457A2325 Upon signing the informed consent form, the subject is assigned to the next sequential Subject No. available. If a subject is re -screened for the study, then he/she must sign a new ICF and be issued a new Subject Number prior to any assessment being cond ucted for the subject under the new Subject Number 6.3.2 Treatment assignment, randomization At Randomization visit, all eligible subjects will be randomized via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) to one of the treatment arms. No re -randomization will be done at Week 12 as the original randomization is already including the Period 2 treatment g roup to be assigned to for Non -responders of the placebo arm. The investigator or his/her delegate will contact the IRT after confirming that the subject fulfills all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The IRT will assign one randomization number to the sub ject, which will be used to link the subject to a treatment arm and will specify a unique medication number for the package of study drug to be dispensed to the subject. The randomization number will not be communicated to the subject. The randomization nu mbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from subjects and investigator staff. A subject randomization list will be produced by the IRT using a validated system that automates the random assignment of subject numbers to randomization numbers. These randomization numbers are linked to the different treatment arms, which in turn are linked to medication numbers. A separate medication list will be produced by or under the responsibility of Novartis Global Clinical Supplies using a validated system that automates the random assignment of medication numbers to packs containing the investigational drug(s) If a subject discontinues before Randomization, the IRT should be notified within five days and the reason for not being randomized should be recorded on the appropriate Case Report Forms. Randomization will be stratified by body weight assessed at baseline. Stratification ensures a balanced allocation of subjects to treatment gr oups within the two weight strata: “body weight < 90 kg” or “body weight ≥ 90 kg”. The randomization scheme for subjects will be reviewed and approved by a member of the Randomization Office. 6.4 Treatment blinding A double -dummy design is used to ensure that the identity of the study drug cannot be disguised, as the drug products are visibly different. Subjects, investigator staff and persons performing the assessments, and data analysts will remain blind to the identity of the study treatment from the time of randomization until the end of study database lock, using the following methods: 1. Randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding, and will not be accessible by anyone else involved in the study with the following exceptions: • Specific vendors whose role in trial conduct requires their unblinding (eg, IRT) • Global Clinica l Supplies"
31,page_31,"Novartis Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Confidential Page 32 0 Protocol No. CAIN457A2325 • The designated Novartis study team members involved in the primary endpoint analysis, as described in Section 4.4. 2. The identity of the treatments will be concealed by the use of investigational treatments that are all identical in packaging, labeling, schedule of administration, appearance, taste and odor. Unblinding will only occur in the case of subject emergencies, at the time of the endpoint analysis as described below. The blind will be kept until the final database lock. The appropriate personnel from the study site and Novartis will assess whether study treatment should be discontinued for any subject whose treatment code has been br oken inadvertently for any reason. Study treatment must be discontinued after emergency unblinding ( Section 6.6.2 ). 6.5 Dose escalation and dose modification Study treatment dose adjustments and/or interruptions are not permitted. However a positive urine pregnancy test during the study requires immediate interruption of study treatment until serum pregnancy test is performed and found to be negative. If the serum test is positive, study treatment must be permanently discontinued. 6.5.1 Follow -up for toxicities Not applicable. 6.6 Additional treatment guidance 6.6.1 Treatment compliance All doses of study treatment administration will be recorded on the appropriate case report form. Compliance will also be assessed and confirmed by a field monitor by drug accountability logs, by documentation and information provided by IRT and by the qualified site personnel that is responsible for treatment dispensation, preparation, administration and accountability. Cross -checks should be performed in case of home admin istrations and empty medication boxes/outer packing/devices should be collected (as permitted by local regulations) for compliance checks by field monitors. 6.6.2 Emergency breaking of assigned treatment code Emergency code breaks must only be undertaken when i t is required to in order to treat the subject safely. Most often, study treatment discontinuation and knowledge of the possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study subject who presents with an emergency condition. Emergency treatment cod e breaks are performed using the IRT. When the investigator contacts the system to break a treatment code for a subject, he/she must provide the requested subject identifying information and confirm the necessity to break the treatment code for the subject . The investigator will then receive details of the investigational drug treatment for the specified subject and a fax or email confirming this information. The system will"
32,page_32,"Novartis Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Confidential Page 33 0 Protocol No. CAIN457A2325 automatically inform the Novartis monitor for the site and the study team that the code has been broken. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a dependable procedure in place to allow access to the IRT at any time in case of emergency. The investigator will provide: • protocol number • study drug name (if available) • subject number In addition, oral and written information to the subject must be provided on how to contact his/her back -up in cases of emergency, or when he/she is unavailable, to ensure that un-blinding can be performed at any time. 6.7 Preparation and dispensation Each study site will be supplied with study drug in packaging as described under investigational and control drugs section. A unique medication number is printed on the study medication label. Investigator staff will identify the study medication kits to dispense to the subject by contacting the IRT and obtaining the medication number(s). The study medication has a 2-part label (base plus tear -off label), immediately before dispensing the medication kit to the subject, site personnel will detach the outer part of the label from the packaging and affix it to the source document. 6.7.1 Handling of study treatment and additional treatment 6.7.1.1 Handling of study treatment Study treatment must be received by a designated person at the study site, handled and stored safely and properly and kept in a secured location to which only the investigator and designated site personnel have access. Upon receipt, all study treatment must be stored according to the instructions specified on the labels. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in accordance with the protocol. Technical complaints are to be report ed to the respective Novartis CO Quality Assurance. Medication labels will be in the local language and comply with the legal requirements of each country. They will include storage conditions for the study treatment but no information about the subject ex cept for the medication number. The investigator must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of study treatment in a drug accountability log. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by monitors during site visits or remotely and at the completion of the trial. Subjects will be asked to return all unused study treatment and packaging at the end of the study or at the time of discontinuation of study treatment. The subjects will record the date(s) of administration at home on a diary/form and will return the used medication and packaging at their next visit to the site. Subjects will be asked to return all unused medication and packaging the latest at the completion of the study or at the time of"

Site staff will record in the appropriate documents the dates of the administration. Detailed instructions will be provided separately. At the conclusion of the study, and as appropriate during the course of the study, the investigator will return all unused study treatment, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug accountability log to the Novartis monitor or to the Novartis address provided in the investigator folder at each site. 6.7.1.2 Handling of additional treatment Not applicable. 6.7.2 Instruction for prescribing and taking study treatment All doses of study treatment (secukinumab and/or placebo) will be self -administered by the subject either at the study site or at home. The first use at Randomization and the Visit Week 1 assessments of the self-injection will take place in the context of an observed assessment under the supervision of one site staff member. Each assessment will be conducted on a 1:1 basis. At the Randomization Visit the subjects will be instructed by the site staff walking them through the Instructions For Use (IFU) on how to self -inject via the PFS and AI (the IFU brochure containing detailed information about self-administration of study treatment should be provided to each subject at the beginning of the study). After providing detailed explanations/instructions, subjects will then be asked to raise any questions. Thereafter, they will proceed with self -injection. At Week 1 subjects will be asked to refer to the IFU and to proceed with self -injection of the actual study drug (i.e., without a detailed explanation/instruction on handling the syringe and auto -injector). At Randomization and Week 1, site staff will observe and complete the self-injection assessment checklist (Table 8-5) and the possible hazard assessment check list ( Table 8 -6) for the 2 mL auto-injector. Home administrations should be done at pre -defined visits ( Table 8 -1) and can be performed by the subject. If self-administration is not chosen, these administrations can be performed by a trained caregiver. If the subject or caregiver is not able/confident to perform home administration, the subject will be allowed to return to the site for administration of the medication. However, during those site visits no additional assessments will be required. During home administrations subjects are expected to contact the investigator/site staff in case they are experiencing any AE/SAEs or have any concerns. Administration All doses of study treatment that are administered at the study site should be performed after the study assessments for the visit, including blood sampling and the completion of DLQI questionnaire by the subjects, have been completed. The f irst study treatment administration will occur at the Randomization/baseline Visit, after all study scheduled assessments have been performed (and inclusion/exclusion criteria confirmed) and only after the scheduled blood samples have been drawn."

Administration of study treatment may vary on the body regions, i.e., changing the injection site from visit to visit : right thigh, left thigh, right stomach, left stomach, upper outer arm (when assisted by attendant), whilst separating the 2 mL AI and the two 1 mL PFS injection sites. Used syringes and AI should be disposed immediately after use in a sharps container or according to the regulatory needs of the respective countries. More information can be found in the study -specific IFU. All dates and times of injections during the study must be recorded on the appropriate CR F. All kits of study treatment assigned by the IRT will be recorded/databased in the IRT. The investigator must promote compliance by instructing the subject to take the study treatment exactly as prescribed and by stating that compliance is necessary for the subject’s safety and the validity of the study. The subject must also be instructed to contact the investigator if he/she is unable for any reason to take the study treatment as prescribed. 7 Informed consent procedures Eligible subjects may only be inc luded in the study after providing (witnessed, where required by law or regulation), IRB/IEC -approved informed consent. If applicable, in cases where the subject's representative(s) gives consent (if allowed according to local requirements), the subject must be informed about the study to the extent possible given his/her understanding. If the subject is capable of doing so, he/she must indicate agreement by personally signing and dating the written informed consent document. Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study -specific procedures (eg, all of the procedures described in the protocol). The process of obtaining informed consent must be documented in the subject source documents. Novartis will provide to investigators in a separate document a proposed informed consent form that complies with the International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and regulatory requirements and is considered appropriate for this study. Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by the investigator must be agreed by Novartis before submission to the IRB/IEC. Information about common side effects already known ab out the investigational drug can be found in the Investigator's Brochure (IB). This information will be included in the subject informed consent and should be discussed with the subject during the study as needed. Any new information regarding the safety profile of the investigational drug that is identified between IB updates will be communicated as appropriate, for example, via an investigator notification (IN) or an aggregate safety finding. New information might require an update to the informed consen t and then must be discussed with the subject. Women of child bearing potential must be informed that taking the study treatment may involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that in order to participate in th e study they must adhere to the contraception requirements."

A copy of the approved version of all consent forms must be provided to Novartis/sponsor after IRB/IEC approval. 8 Visit schedule and assessments Assessment schedule lists all of the assessments and when they are performed. All data obtained from these assessments must be supported in the subject’s source documentat ion. Subjects should be seen for all visits as outlined in the assessment schedule or as close to the designated day/time as possible. Every effort should be made to respect the timeframe for all visits and particularly when . Misse d or rescheduled visits should not lead to automatic discontinuation. Subjects who prematurely discontinue the study for any reason should be scheduled for the final visit as soon as possible at which time all of the assessments listed for the final visit will be performed. At this final visit, all dispensed investigational product should be reconciled, and the adverse events and concomitant medications recorded on the CRF. For subjects who discontinue study treatment prematurely for any reason other than withdrawal of informed consent or loss to follow -up procedures as described in Section 9 should be followed. During Treatment Periods 1 and 2, subjects may be seen at an unscheduled visit, eg, if they experience deterior ation of psoriasis, or AEs that in the opinion of the investigator need intervention or repeated laboratory testing. During these unscheduled visits, study treatment will NOT be administered. The assessment(s) performed at an unscheduled visit are at the investigator’s discretion. Order of assessments Guidance for the order of assessments as shown in Table 8 -1 is as follows (may vary depending on different type of visits): Investigator / Qualified Site Staff 1. IGA mod 2011 2. PASI 3. Other procedures • All remaining study visit procedures (eg, laboratory and collection, vital signs measurements) must be completed prior to study treatment administration. • Enter PASI and IGA mod 2011 assessments into eCRFs BEFORE contacting IRT at Randomization Visit and EOT1 Visit Week 12. • Contact IRT to register the subject visit. • Prepare the corresponding study medication packs as indicated in the study -specific IFU brochure (dispense for h ome administrations, as required). • Provide guidance to subjects for self -administration prior to the first treatment administration ( Section 6.7.2 ) at Randomization; from Visit Week 1 until End of Treatment Period 2 subjects should refer to the IFU and proceed with self-"

The date of the new informed consent signature must be entered on the appropriate eCRF page to correspond to the new screening subject number. For re-screening, all screening assessments must be performed per protocol, except for the tuberculosis (TB) work up (including any chest x-ray), if applicable, if performed not more than 12 weeks before randomization. 8.1.1 Information to be collected on screening failures Subjects who sign the ICF and discontinue prior to randomization at the Randomization Visit are considered screening failures. IRT must be notified within fiv e days and the reason for not being randomized will be entered in the appropriate eCRF page. The Screening Visit date, the Demography, Informed Consent, and Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria eCRF sections should be completed. The Adverse Event eCRF section and a SAE Form should be completed for any SAE that occurred during the Screening Period. Adverse events that are not SAEs will be followed by the investigator and collected only in the source data. The Withdrawal of consent eCRF section should be completed if consent was withdrawn prior to the randomization. 8.2 Subject demographics/other baseline characteristics Country specific regulations should be considered for the collection of demographic and baseline characteristics in alignment with CRF 8.2.1 Demographics Subject demographic data will include: age (in years), sex, race, ethnicity, and child -bearing potential (for females only). 8.2.2 Psoriasis medical history/previous psoriasis therapies The following information should be collected and entered in the eCRF secti on in addition to pre-psoriasis therapies: • The date of first diagnosis of plaque -type psoriasis • The date of first diagnosis of other locations or clinical forms of psoriasis, eg: • Generalized pustular or pustular palmoplantar psoriasis • Guttate, palmoplantar, nail, inverse, scalp or erythrodermic psoriasis"

Note : Involvement of nails is not part of the assessment Based on this scale, the following criteria apply: • A subject will be eligible to participate in the study if she/he has an IGA mod 2011 score at the Randomization Visit of 3 or 4. • A subject will be considered as IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 responder if she/he achieves a score of 0 or 1, and improved by at least 2 points on the IGA scale at a given time point compared to baseline. 8.3.2 Assessment of total Body Surface Area (BSA) and Psoriasis Ar ea Severity Index (PASI) The investigator or qualified designee will complete the PASI assessment. Whenever possible, PASI assessments should be performed by the same evaluator throughout the study. The total BSA affected by plaque -type psoriasis will be e stimated as first step of PASI calculation from the percentages of areas affected, including head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs (see Table 8 -3). The following calculations will be done: each reported percentage will be multiplied by its respective body region corresponding factor (head = 0.1, trunk = 0.3, upper limbs = 0.2, lower limbs = 0.4). The resulting 4 percentages will be added up to estimate the total BSA affected by plaque -type psoriasis. A PASI score ( Fredriksson and Pettersson 1978, Weisman et al 2003, Gottlieb et a l 2005 ) will be derived as indicated in Table 8 -3. The head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs are assessed separately for erythema, thickening (plaque elevation, induration), and scaling (desquamation). The average degree o f severity of each sign in each of the four body regions is assigned a score of 0 -4. The area covered by lesions on each body region is estimated as a percentage of the total area of that particular body region.

Significant findings made after first administration of investigational drug which meet the definition of an AE must be record ed on the Adverse Event section of the eCRF Vital signs (including blood pressure and pulse measurements) will be assessed at every scheduled visit as indicated in Table 8 -1. Whenever possible, assessments should be performed by the same study site staff member throughout the study. After the subject has been sitting for five minutes, with back supported and both feet placed on the floor, systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be measured twice (measurements separated by 1 to 2 minutes) using a validated device, with an appropriately sized cuff ( Mancia et al 2007 ). In case the cuf f sizes available are not large enough for the subject’s arm circumference, a sphygmomanometer with an appropriately sized cuff may be used. Measurements will be recorded in the source documentation and the average of the two measurements will be entered o n the Vital Signs eCRF section. Normal blood pressure will be defined as a systolic pressure of 90 to < 120mmHg, and a diastolic blood pressure of 60 to < 80 mmHg under measurement conditions as outlined above. Notable blood pressure will be hypertension ( systolic ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic > 90 mmHg) or hypotension (systolic < 90 mmHg and/or diastolic < 60 mmHg). A blood pressure indicative of pre -hypertension (systolic 120 to < 140 mmHg and/or diastolic 80 to < 90 mmHg) will not be regarded as notable (Chobanian et al 2003 ).

Assessment of possible administration hazards will be based on identified hazards list ( Table 8 -6) as well as non-directed querying for any observed p roblems during self -injection. The First Use at Randomization and the Week 1 assessments will take place in the context of an observed assessment under the supervision of one site staff member. Each assessment will be conducted on a 1:1 basis. At the Rando mization visit the subjects will be instructed through the site staff by walking them through the IFU on how to self-inject via AI (and PFS). Subjects will then be asked to raise any questions if they have any. Thereafter, they should proceed with self -injection. At Visit Week 1 subjects will be asked to refer to the IFU and to proceed with self-injection of the actual study drug (i.e., without providing explanations/instructions). During the self -injections at the respective visits (Randomization and Week 1) site staff will observe and complete the 2mL self -injection assessment checklist ( Table 8 -5) and the possible hazard assessment check list ( Table 8 -6) for the auto -injector. The primary usability variables will be assessed based on binary (performed correctly: yes/no) response for the self -injection assessment check list.

During the self-injection the observing site staff member must exercise judgment and intervene in the self -administration should a subject not be acting in a safe or reasonable manner, or any manner which does not fall within the scope of the study objectives, including but not limited to: a. In the event that a subject performs (or is judged to be about to perform) a use error which could pose a risk to the health or well -being of a subject the observing site staff member will pause the subject to point out the error and decide whether it is better to terminate the self-injection. If in his o r her judgment the self -injection can continue, he or she will correct the subject’s usage of the product and notify the subject to recommence at the same point. Any such use error will be documented. b. If there is, or appears to be, any risk of a health and safety incident including injury to any party. It is likely that this will require the self -injection to be terminated at the discretion of the observing site staff member. Any auto -injector for which a defect or malfunction is noticed prior to or during the injection at any of the study visits, must be kept at the site until guidance is received from Novartis on whether it should be returned to Novartis or discarded. Additionally, from Visit Week 2 onwards, any noticed defect, malfunction, and problem dur ing the injections or product complaints with the auto -injector should be recorded in the source document by the site, detailing the issue, the date and the visit number.

Successful self -injection is achieved when the subject performs all required steps effectively and safely to deliver the correct dose from the device at the correct injection site. The sequence of user steps as per IFU “required to be completed for successful administration” are identified in Table 8 -5, these 4 critical steps will be used to define successful admin istration. The general passing usability goal for ‘successful use’ task completion will be defined as ≥ 90% pass rate of following these steps. Secondary usability assessment: • This consist of the assessment of 2mL AI subject use errors that occur during the First Use at Randomization (after providing initial explanations/instructions) and repeated self - injection at Visit Week 1 (without a detailed explanation/instruction on handling the new form) by investigating the frequency of observed or reported difficulties in completing the 2mL AI self -injection after initial explanations/instructions and self -injection without explanations/instructions after a time lag that represents standard treatment. The number and percentage of subjects who successfully complete each of the indicated steps as per the IFU ( Table 8 -5 self-injection assessment check list) as well as the number and percentage of subjects who experience any of the defined possible hazards (based on identified hazards list) as well as non-directed querying for any observed problems during self-injection (Table 8-6) will be computed by visit. • This consist of the assessment of successful First Use by subject after initial explanations/instructions, by studying the number and percentage of subjects at Randomization who successfully perform the self-injection as defined above for the primary usabi lity assessment. 8.5.1.1 Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) All subjects will complete the PRO questions via an electronic tablet. The subject should be given sufficient space and time to complete the questionnaires. In case of any issues with tablet use, which cannot be resolved within the visit time window subject can complete PRO questions on paper form. If subject experiences any difficulties with submission after they complete the PROs, the study staff should assist with submitting the PRO responses. Attempt s should be made to collect responses to all PROs for all subjects, including from those who prematurely discontinue prior to the study evaluation completion visit, however, if subjects refuse to complete PROs, this should be documented in study source rec ords. Subject’s refusal to complete study PROs are not protocol deviations. 8.5.1.1.1 Self-Injection Assessment Questionnaire (SIAQ) The SIAQ measures the overall subject experience with subcutaneous self -injection, and to investigate the psychometric properties ( Keininger and Coteur 2011 , Appendix 4 ). The SIAQ"
52,page_52,"Novartis Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Confidential Page 53 1 Protocol No. CAIN457A2325 will be performed as a summary assessment for the auto-injector as outlined in the visit schedule (see Table 8-1). The SIAQ PRE module is to be self-completed before the first self-injection at Randomization. The SIAQ POST module is to be completed following the 2 mL AI self -injections and before the 1 mL PFS injections at the self -injections as the visits indicated in Table 8 -1, including Randomization. The PRE module includes 7 items grouped into th ree domains: Feelings about injections, Self - confidence and Satisfaction with self -injection (see Appendix 4 ) The POST module includes several items addressing four principal domains: Feelings about injections, Self -confidence, Injection site reactions, Ease of use plus a single item assessing Self-image. The two modules of the SIAQ should be completed by subjects while alone in a quiet environment. The PRE module is completed immediately before the first self -injection and the POST module is completed 20 -40 minutes after the 2 mL AI dosing but before the 1 mL PFS injection (three injections). There is no stipulate d recall period for the SIAQ, because the recall period varies from one domain to another. For example, items from the injection -site reaction burden domain refer to the subject’s experience during or after the injection, whereas items from the general feelings about injections domain refer to general attitudes. Subjects should rate each item of the SIAQ on a 5-point semantic Likert -type scale, where a score of 1 corresponded to the subject’s worst experience and a score of 5 corresponds to the subject’s best experience. Item scores will be transformed to obtain a score ranging from 0 (worst experience) to 10 (best experience) for each item. The domain score will be the mean of the item scores included in the domain. Domain scores will be calculated only if at least half of the domain items were completed. The SIAQ questionnaire (date of publication 2011) will be completed by the subject as indicated in Table 8-1. 8.5.1.1.2 Health -related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaires The impact of psoriasis on various aspects of subject’s health -related quality of life (HRQoL) will be assessed by the DLQI. This questionnaire sh ould be completed by subjects before they see the study physician (investigator or designee) who will perform the investigator assessments. It will be completed in the language the respondent is most familiar with. The subject should be given sufficient space and time to complete the questionnaires. The study coordinator should check it for completeness and encourage the subject to complete any missing responses. Completed questionnaires will be reviewed and examined by the investigator only after the clinical efficacy assessments (IGA mod 2011, PASI), for responses that may indicate potential AEs or SAEs. The investigator should review not only the responses to th e questions in the questionnaires but also for any unsolicited comments written by the subject. If AEs or SAEs are confirmed then the investigator must record the events as per instructions given in Section"

Investigator should not encourage the subject to change the responses reported in the completed questionnaires. The DLQI is a 10 -item general dermatology disability index designed to assess health -related quality of life in adult subjects with skin diseases such as eczema, psoriasis, acne, and viral warts ( Finlay and Khan 1994 , Appendix 5 ). The measure is self -administered and includes domains of daily activities, leisure, personal relationships, symptoms and feelings, treatment, and work/school. The measure is widely used: it has been tested across 32 different skin conditions and is available in 55 languages. The recall period is the last week, and the instrument requires 1 to 2 minutes for completion. Each item has four response categories, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). ""Not relevant"" is also a valid response and is scored as 0. The DLQI total score is a sum of the 10 quest ions. Scores range from 0 to 30, and higher scores indicate greater health -related quality -of-life impairment. Additionally, each subscale of the DLQI may be analyzed separately. The purpose of the DLQI in this study is to investigate the effects of treatment of secukinumab with respect at Week 12, compared to placebo, and over time up to Week 52, compared to placebo.

57,page_57,"Novartis Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Confidential Page 58 1 Protocol No. CAIN457A2325 slow enrollment), or for regulatory or medical reasons. In taking the decision to terminate, Novartis will always consider the subject welfare and safety. Sho uld early termination be necessary, subjects must be seen as soon as possible (provide instruction for contacting the subject, when the subject should stop taking drug, when the subject should come for a final visit) and treated as a prematurely withdrawn subject. The investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subject’s interests. The investigator or sponsor depending on the local regulation will be re sponsible for informing IRBs/IECs of the early termination of the trial. 9.2 Study completion and post -study treatment Study completion is defined as when the last subject finishes their Study Completion visit (Visit Week 52), and any repeat assessments associated with this visit have been documented and followed -up appropriately by the Investigator, or in the event of an early study termination decision, the date of that decision (eg, each subject will be requi red to complete the study in its entirety and thereafter no further study treatment will be made available to them). 10 Safety monitoring and reporting 10.1 Definition of adverse events and reporting requirements 10.1.1 Adverse events An adverse event (AE) is any untowa rd medical occurrence (eg, any unfavorable and unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a subject or clinical investigation subject after providing written informed consent for participation in the study until the en d of study visit. Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product. Novartis qualified medical personnel will be readily available to advise on trial related medical questions and problems. In addition, all reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered an adverse event irrespective if a clinical event has occurred. The occurrence of adverse events must be sought by non -directive que stioning of the subject at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by the subject during or between visits or through physical examination findings, laboratory test findings, or other assessments. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events (Information about adverse drug reactions for the investigational drug can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB)) only if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria: • they induce c linical signs or symptoms, • they are considered clinically significant, • they require therapy."
58,page_58,"Novartis Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Confidential Page 59 1 Protocol No. CAIN457A2325 Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results must be identified through a review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to b e non -typical in subject with underlying disease. Investigators have the responsibility for managing the safety of individual subject and identifying adverse events. Alert ranges for laboratory and other test abnormalities are included in Appendix 1 . Adverse events must be recorded in the appropriate CRF capturing Adverse Events under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with them, accompanied by the following information: 1. the severity grade • mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities • moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities • severe: prevents normal activities 2. its relationship to the study treatment (suspected: Yes / No) 3. its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing an outcome of not recovered/not resolved must be reported. 4. whether it constitutes a serious adverse event SAE – (See Section 10.1.2 for definition of SAE) and which seriousness criteria have been met. 5. action taken regarding study treatment. All adverse events must be treated appropriately. Treatment may include one or more of the following: • Dose not changed • Dose Reduced/increased • Drug interrupted/withdrawn 6. its outcome (not recovered/not resolved; recovered/resolved; recovered/resolved with sequelae; fatal; or unknown 7. concomitant medication or non -drug therapy given 8. subject hospitalized/subject’s hospitalization pr olonged (see Section 10.1.2 for definition of SAE) Once an adverse event is detected, it must be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and assessment must be made at each visit (or more frequent ly, if necessary) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. Worsening of psoriasis in this study is evaluated via the use of PASI, IGA mod 2011 and DLQI assessments and is not expected to be captured as an AE in the CRF capturing adverse events. Exceptions include cases when a) a new type of psoriasis is diagnosed eg, guttate psoriasis or b) the worsening of psoriasis is so severe that a qualitatively different status is reached. Information about common side effects already known about the investigational drug can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB). This information will be included in the subject informed consent and should be discussed with the subject during the study as needed. Any new"
59,page_59,"Novartis Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Confidential Page 60 1 Protocol No. CAIN457A2325 information regarding the safety profile of the medicinal product that is identified between IB updates will be communicated as appropriate, for example, via an Investigator Not ification or an Aggregate Safety Finding. New information might require an update to the informed consent and has then to be discussed with the subject. The investigator must also instruct each subject to report any new adverse event (beyond the protocol observation period) that the subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to study treatment. This information must be recorded in the investigator’s source documents; however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE, it must be reported to Novartis. 10.1.2 Serious adverse events An SAE is defined as any adverse event [appearance of (or worsening of any pre -existing)] undesirable sign(s), sympto m(s) or medical conditions(s)) which meets any one of the following criteria: • is fatal or life-threatening • results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity • constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect • requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless hospitalization is for: • routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition • elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent • treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission • social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the subje ct’s general condition • is medically significant, eg, defined as an event that jeopardizes the subject or may require medical or surgical intervention. All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other seriousness cr iteria are not met. Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (ple ase refer to Annex IV, ICH -E2D Guideline). Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or r esult in death or hospitalization but might jeopardize the subject or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Examples of such events considered as “medically significant” are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse (please refer to Annex IV, ICH -E2D Guideline)."
60,page_60,"Novartis Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 00) Confidential Page 61 1 Protocol No. CAIN457A2325 Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction. 10.1.3 SAE reporting To ensure subject safety, every SAE, regardless of causality, occurring after the subject has provided informed consent and until 12 weeks following the last administration of study treatment must be reported to Novartis safety within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Any SAEs experienced after 12 week period following the last administration of study treatment should only be reported to Novartis safety if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to study treatment. All SAEs reported up to the subject’s last visi t will be reported in the appropriate eCRF. SAEs beyond the last visit will only be recorded in the Novartis Drug Safety and Epidemiology database. All follow -up information for the SAE including information on complications, progression of the initial SAE and recurrent episodes must be reported as follow -up to the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previousl y reported one must be reported separately as a new event. Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically thorough report . The investigator must assess the relationship of each SAE to study treatment, complete the SAE Report Form in English, and submit the completed form within 24 hours to Novartis. Detailed instructions regarding the submission process and requirements for signature are to be found in the investigator folder provided to each site. Follow -up information is submitted as instructed in the investigator folder. Each re-occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event must be reported as a follow -up to that event regardless of when it occurs. The follow -up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not, and whether the subject continued or withdrew from study participation. If the SAE is not previously documented in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study treatment a Drug Safety and Epidemiology Department associate may urgently require further information from the investigator for health authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same study treatment that this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with EU Guidance 2011/C 172/01 or as per national regulatory requirements in participating coun tries."

The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. Pregnancy must be recorded on the Pharmacovigilance Pregnancy Form and reported by the investigator to the Novartis Chief Medical Office and Patient Safety (CMO & PS) Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study treatment. Any SAE experienced during the pregnancy and unrelated to the pregnancy must be reported on a SAE form. 10.1.5 Reporting of study treatment e rrors including misuse/abuse Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration or monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, subject or consumer (EMA definition). Misuse refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately used not in accordance with the protocol. Abuse corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of a medicinal product, which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effects. Study treatment errors and uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol will be recorded on the appropriate CRF irrespective of whether or not associated with an AE/SAE and reported to Safety only if associated with an SAE. Misuse or abuse will be collected and reported in the safety database irrespective of it being associated with an AE/SAE within 24 hours of Investigator’s awareness.

Designated investigator site staff will not be given access to the system until they have been trained. Automatic validation procedures within the system check for data discrepancies during and after data entry and, by generating appropriate error messages, allow the data to be confirmed or correct ed online by the designated investigator site staff. The Investigator must certify that the data entered into the electronic Case Report Forms are complete and accurate. After database lock, the investigator will receive copies of the subject data for arch iving at the investigational site. All data should be recorded, handled and stored in a way that allows its accurate reporting, interpretation and verification. 11.2 Database management and quality control Novartis personnel (or designated Contract Research Organization (CRO) will review the da ta entered by investigational staff for completeness and accuracy. Electronic data queries stating the nature of the problem and requesting clarification will be created for discrepancies and missing values and sent to the investigational site via the EDC system. Designated investigator site staff is required to respond promptly to queries and to make any necessary changes to the data. Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Reference Li st, which employs the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification system. Concomitant procedures, non -drug therapies and adverse events will be coded using the Medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) terminology. Laboratory samples will be processed centrally and the results will be sent electronically to Novartis (or a designated CRO). ECGs will be analyzed centrally and results will be sent electronically to Novartis (or a designated CRO). Any clinically significant findings will be repor ted as (cardiovascular) medical history or AE depending upon timing of ECG assessment compared to screening. Subjects will fill in their PRO data in a site based tablet. The system will be supplied by a vendor, who will also manage the database. The database will be sent electronically to Novartis personnel (or designated CRO)."

The system will be supplied by a vendor, who will also manage the database. The data will be sent electronically to Novartis (or a designated CRO). Each occurrence of a code break via IRT will be reported to the clinical team and monitor. The code break functionality will remain available until study shut down or upon request of Novartis. The occurrence of relevant protocol deviations will be determined. After these actions have been completed and the database has been declared to be complete and accur ate, it will be locked and the treatment codes will be unblinded and made available for data analysis. Any changes to the database after that time can only be made after written agreement by Novartis Development management. 11.3 Site monitoring Before study initiation, at a site initiation visit or at an investigator’s meeting, a Novartis/ representative will review the protocol and data capture requirements (i.e., eCRFs) with the investigators and their staff. During the study, Novartis employs several methods of ensuring protocol and GCP compliance and the quality/integrity of the sites’ data. The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of subject records, the accuracy of data capture / data entry, the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispen sed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. Additionally, a central analytics organization may analyze data & identify risks & trends for site operational parame ters, and provide reports to Novartis clinical teams to assist with trial oversight. The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their consistency with the data capture and/or data entry. Novartis monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the CRFs are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the subjects will be disclosed. 12 Data anal ysis and statistical methods The analysis will be conducted on all subject data up to Week 16 for the week 16 interim analysis and on all data at the time of the trial ends for the final analysis.

Unless otherwise specified, subjects with missing informed consent form as well as mis-randomized subjects (mis-randomized in IRT) will be excluded from the randomize d set. (Mis -randomized subjects are subjects who are screen -failures, but have been randomized by the investigator before eligibility was finally assessed, however have not been treated. If subjects were re-screened and successfully randomized, they will be included in the randomized set according to the treatment assigned in the last randomization.). Full analysis set (FAS) : The FAS will be comprised of all subjects from the randomized set to whom study treatment has been assigned. Following the inte nt-to-treat principle, subjects will be analyzed according to the treatment assigned to at randomization. Safety set : The safety set includes all subjects who took at least one dose of study treatment during the treatment period. Subjects will be analyzed according to treatment received. 12.2 Subject demographics and other baseline characteristics Unless otherwise specified, for subject demographics and other baseline characteristics, analyses will be based on the randomized set.

The statistical hypothesis is that secukinumab 300 mg (2 mL AI) is not superior to placebo with respect to the proportion of subjects with PASI 75 response and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response at Week 12. Let pj denote the proportion of PASI 75 responders at Week 12 for treatment group j and rj denote the proportion of IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 responders at Week 12 for treatment group j, j = 1, 0 where, • 0 corresponds to placebo • 1 corresponds to secukinumab 300 mg (2 mL AI) The following hypothesis will be tested: • H1: p1 − p0 ≤ 0 versus HA1: p1 − p0 > 0, • H2: r1 − r0 ≤ 0 versus HA2: r1 − r0 > 0 In other words: H1: Secukinumab 300 mg (2 mL AI) is not superior to placebo with respect to PASI 75 response at Week 12 H2: Secukinumab 300 mg (2 mL AI) is not superior to placebo with respect to IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response at Week 12 The primary analysis method will be the logistic regression with treatment group (secukinumab 2mL AI vs Placebo); baseline bodyweight strata and baseline PASI score as explanatory variables. Odds ratios will be computed for comparisons of secukinumab dose regimen versus placebo utilizing the logistic regression model fitted. In case of response rates of 0% or of 100% in one of the treatment groups, Fisher’s exact test will be applied. Confidence intervals for risk difference will be derived based on the exact method. If logistic regression model does not converge the following steps wil l be performed: 1. Run the PROC GENMOD procedure with EXACT statement; 2. If convergence not reached, remove the covariates from the model one by one until convergence is reached; start with continuous covariates (baselines PASI score), followed by removing cate gorical covariates (i.e., weight stratum etc.,); 3. If convergence not reached, perform Fisher’s exact test. In case of response rates of 0% or of 100% in one of the treatment groups, Fisher’s exact test will be applied. Confidence intervals for risk difference will be derived based on the exact method. The hypotheses H1 and H2 will both be tested at level 2.5% ( one-sided), and significant results will only be achieved if both tests are rejected. If only one hypothesis is rejected and the other hypothesis is not rejected, superiority of secukinumab 300 mg (2 mL AI) has not been demonstrated."

MI is a simulation based approach where missing values are replaced by multiple Bayesian draws from the conditional distribution of missing data given the observed data and covariates, creating multiple completed data sets. These completed data sets can then be analyzed using standard methods. Within this analysis the PASI score or IGA mod 2011 categories will be imputed and response variables will be derived based on the imputed scores. In the multiple imputation analysis the response status will b e imputed based on the individual treatment arm information. • Non-responder imputation will be used as sensitivity method: Missing values with respect to response variables based on PASI score and IGA mod 2011 categories will be imputed with non -response re gardless to the reason for missing data (eg, premature study discontinuation, missed visit, administrative issues), exceptions will apply to the following: • If a subject dropped out of the study prior to last scheduled efficacy assessment and being responder consecutively at least for two preceding visits, the subject will be imputed as responder for the last scheduled visit. • If a subject who was responder at visit x -1 and visit x+1 but has missing data at visit x, then the subject will be imputed as responder for visit x as long as the distance between the scheduled visits x-1 and x is 4 weeks or less, or the distance between the scheduled visits x and x+1 is 4 weeks or less. Otherwise missing data will be imputed with non-response. 12.4.4 Sensitivity analyses Co-primary variables will be evaluated using the logistic regression as described in primary analysis method with non -responder imputations as sensitivity analyses. 12.5 Analysis of secondary endpoints The key secondary endpoint of this study is PASI 90 respon se at Week 12. Testing strategy As stated in Section 12.4.2 , the hypotheses H 1 and H 2 will be included in co -primary testing procedure. Each hypotheses is tested at α = 2.5% (one -sided). The testing sequence will continue to key secondary endpoint PASI 90 at α = 2.5% (one -sided) only if both H 1 and H 2 have been rejected at α (one-sided) such that a family -wise type-I-error of α (one-sided) is kept. H3: secukinumab 300 mg (2 mL AI) is not superior to placebo with respect to PASI 90 response at Week 12 PASI 90 response will be analyzed analogously to the primary endpoints at Week 12, i.e., the logistic regression model with treatment group, baseline body weight strata and baseline PASI score as exploratory variables.

Additional interim analyses may be performed to support health authority interactions as necessary. Trial modifications are not planned based on any interim analysis. At the end of study, a final analysis of all data collected up to last study visit (Week 52) will be performed when all subjects have completed the last study visit. 12.8 Sample size calculation A response rate of 8% for PASI 75 response and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response in the placebo group is expected, whereas a response rate of 62% for PASI 75 response and 55% for IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 is the anticipated response in the secukinumab 300 mg (2 mL auto -injector s.c.) group. Placebo -response rates between 3% and 7% have been reported in ( Papp et al 2005, Menter et al 2008, Leonardi et al 2008 ). 12.8.1 Primary endpoint(s) With respect to the co-primary endpoints (PASI 75 response and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response at Week 12), the type-I-error will be 2.5% one-sided for comparison. With 40 subjects per group and assuming a response rate of 8% for PASI 75 response and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response in the placebo group, the power to show a response rate of 62% for PASI 75 response and 55% for IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response in the secukinumab 300 mg (2 mL auto -injector s.c.) group based on Fisher’s exact test (nQuery Advisor 7.01, two group Fisher’s -exact test of equal proportions) is above 99% for PASI 75 resp onse and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response. 12.8.2 Secondary endpoint(s) The study should be sufficiently powered (above 90%) to show a response rate of 46% points in PASI 90 response if the placebo rate is assumed as 8%. 13 Ethical considerations and administrative procedures 13.1 Regulatory and ethical compliance This clinical study was designed and shall be implemented, executed and reported in accordance with the ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, with applicable"

If despite this interdiction prohibition, data, information, observation would be incidentally collected, the investigator shall immediately disclose it to Novartis and not use it for any purpose other than the study, except for the appropriate monito ring on study participants. Investigators ascertain they will apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations. If an investigator feels a protocol deviation would improve the conduct of the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless su ch an amendment is agreed upon by Novartis and approved by the IRB/IEC and health authorities, where required, it cannot be implemented. 14.1 Protocol amendments Any change or addition to the protocol can only be made in a written protocol amendment that must be approved by Novartis/sponsor health authorities where required, and the IRB/IEC prior to implementation. Only amendments that are required for subject safe ty may be implemented immediately provided the health authorities are subsequently notified by protocol amendment and the reviewing IRB/IEC is notified. Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal protocol amendments, the investigator is expected to ta ke any immediate action required for the safety of any subject included in this study, even if this action represents a deviation from the protocol. In such cases, Novartis should be notified of this action and the IRB/IEC at the study site should be infor med according to local regulations."

TB status must be determined by medical history, signs, symptoms and TB central lab testing. Any significant findings will be recorded in the relevant TB assessment eCRF and the Medical History eCRF, as necessary. A central lab testing will be performed to assess the TB status at screening for all subjects. This test will only be used to determine subject’s eligibility for the trial. The test will be used to screen the subject population for latent tuberculosis infection ( Doherty et al 2008 ). This blood -based assay is specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is not influenced by previous Bacillus Calmette -Guérin vaccination or by exposure to other Mycobacteria species. Furthermore, this test, in contrast to the purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test, is also insensitive to a booster effect since the subject is not exposed to the vaccine. The assay measures the production of interferon -gamma and presents it relative to a negative and a positive control sample ( Manuel and Kumar 2008 ). The tuberculosis assay test will be supplied by the central laboratory. Details on the collection, shipment of samples and reporting of results by the central laboratory are provided to investigators in the study -specific laboratory manual. Positive or indeterminate tests must be recorded on the Tuberculosis assessment eCRF; the workflow of sample handling in case of positive or indeterminate test results is provided in Figure 16 -1. a. If the test result is negativ e, the subject may be randomized. b. If the test result is positive , the investigator should perform a work -up for the test result as per local procedures. If a TB work -up was conducted prior to the screening of the subject, results of the work -up can be used to assess eligibility if the work -up was conducted within 12 weeks prior to randomization. Subjects positive for latent TB per work -up may be randomized to the trial if sufficient treatment has been initiated according to local routine clinical practice a nd will be maintained for the prescribed duration. Subjects positive for active TB per work -up are not eligible for the study. Subjects negative for TB (no signs of latent or active TB) per work -up may be randomized to the trial. c. If the test result is indeterminate , the investigator may repeat the test once or may proceed directly to perform the work -up for the test result as per local procedures. This action is at the discretion of the investigator. If a TB work -up was conducted p rior to the screening of the subject, results of the work -up can be used to assess eligibility if the work - up was conducted within 12 weeks prior to randomization. i. If the second test is negative , the subject may be randomized. ii. If the second test is positi ve or indeterminate, the investigator should perform workup as per local guidelines. Subject positive for latent TB per workup may be randomized to the trial if sufficient treatment has been initiated according to local routine clinical practice and will be maintained for the prescribed duration. The subject will not be"

If eligibility is being assessed with only 1 test result and a TB work -up (i.e., no s econd TB test will be performed), the TB test to assess eligibility must have been done via the central laboratory for the study within the Screening Period (within 4 weeks prior to randomization) and TB work -up will only be considered if it was completed within 12 weeks prior to randomization. ."
