Although the majority of patients are diagnosed with primary tumours that can be removed by surgery, around 20% will relapse. Recent developments in non -surgical treatments for metastatic melanoma have extended median survi val from around 8 months to 2 years. Even so, for the majority of patients with advanced melanoma , this remains a terminal diagnosis: 5 year survival in 2011 was 16%. ( http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/aboutcancer/type/melanoma/treatment/ melanoma -statistics- and-outlook). There are t wo classes of drugs now e stablished to treat metastatic melanoma: immune checkpoint inhibitors and, for the 45% of patients whose tumours harbou r a BRAF V600 gene mutation, mitogen activated protein ( MAP) kinase pathway targe ted small molecule inhibitors. In 2011, v emurafenib became the first BRAF kinase inhibitor approved for treatment of BRAF mutant metastatic melanoma , offering significant impro vement in progression -free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) compared with standard c hemotherapy (BRIM -3 tria l1: median PFS 5.8 m onths, median OS 13.2 months). Although remarkably high response rates are achieved with vemurafenib and another BRAF inhibitor, dabrafenib2, longer term experience suggest ed that most patients will suffer dis ease progression within 6 -8 months of treatment due to emerging secondary resistance . Several resistance mechanisms have now been described , most of which result in re - activation of intracellular signalling activity through MEK, downstream of BRAF3. Combined BRAF and MEK inhibition has been shown to be an effective strategy in the clinic, extending PFS and OS of treated metastatic melanoma patients compared with BRAF inhibitor alone4–6. Two BRAF and MEK combination regimens have been licensed for use to date: dabrafenib plus trametinib (dab+tram) and vemurafenib plus cobimetinib. Dab+tram received positive National Institute for Health and Care Excellence ( NICE) guidance in June 2016 an d is routinely available to treat patients with BRAF mutant advanced melanoma across the UK. Preliminary results of a trial comparing a third combin ation regimen, e ncorafenib plus binimetinib , with vemurafenib monotherapy reported improved OS in September 2016 . Licensing of this regimen is predicted for 2018. BRAF+MEK inhibitor combination therapy has now largely replaced BRAF inhibitor monotherapy as standard of care worldwide . Despite these combination regimens improving patient outcomes, key challenges remain. Firstly, secondary resistance to therapy limits duration of benefit in most patients: median PFS with BRAF+MEK inhibitor co mbinations is around 12 months4–6. The need for effective strategies to over come or delay the emergence of resistance has been highlighted in several international fora as a major research priority. Secondly, chronic toxicity associated with continuous daily dosing of oral molecular targeted agents is a recognised problem affecting patient compliance with treatmen t and requires active management7. The main toxicities of concern affect the skin , with rash and/or hyperkeratosis occurring in up to 40% of treated patients. Photosensi tivity appears to be drug -specific and while almost universal in patients receiving vemurafenib, occurs in around 10% of patients receiving dab+tram . Interestingly , premalignant lesions and squamous cell skin cancers can occur in around 30% patients receiving BRAF inhibitor monotherapy, but the incidence repor ted with dab+tram is less than 5%, suggesting that addition of the MEK inhibitor attenuates BRAF-driven"
14,page_14,"EudraCT number: 2016- 005228- 27 IRAS ID Number: 213113 Page 15 of 74 INTERIM Protocol Version: V1. 1 Version Date: 2 1 September 2017 hyperproliferation of normal skin . Although not usually life -threatening, these chronic skin adverse events mean that close patient monitoring is required and suspicious lesions need t o be removed promptly. Other common side effects affecting patient quality of life (QoL) include fatigue and diarrhoea. Less common events include choreoretinopathy, hypertension and left ventricular failure. Unique to dab+tram is a syndrome of intermit tent fevers and chills affecting over half of treated patients, often most prevalent at the onset on treatment. These symptoms occur most often in the absence of infection, although myelosuppression has been reported rarely. Even so, in a cancer population , hospitalisation and treatment for non -neutropenic sepsis is no t uncommon. Toxicity is particularly concerning in older patients, who make up an increasing proportion of cancer sufferers in keeping with an ageing population. A large scale, multi -centre Expanded Access Study (EAS) of vemurafenib demonstrated a higher frequency of grade 3 and 4 adverse events in patients aged 75 years and over (59% had grade 3 events vs 43% of under 75 years) 8. The f inal key challenge is that BRAF+MEK inhibitors are high cost drugs and their prescription and toxicity managem ent contribute to the rising overall health service expenditure. Clinical experience shows that intermittent dosing can successfully manage drug - induced toxicity and sustain patients on BRAF targete d treatment. In the BRIM -3 trial1, 38% of patients required modification and/or interruption of vemurafenib treatment. In the EAS, the proportion was even higher at 58%, b ut even so, outcomes in terms of PFS and OS were consistent with BRIM -3, suggesting that these changes in dosing do not compromise efficacy1,9. Therefore, pre-planned intermittent dosing of oral BRAF targeted agents may be an important way of sustaining patients on treatment for longer. Furthermore, intermittent drug dosing may delay the onset of disease progression, since continuous dosing promotes clonal e xpansion of drug resistant cells3. In a mouse model, vemurafenib resist ant tumour cells were shown to become drug - dependent10. Resistant cells suffer ed a fitness deficit in the absence of drug suggesting that intermittent dosing can delay or prevent the emergence of resistant tumour clones. Mice survived twice as long (200 days compared with 100 days) on an intermittent dosing schedule of vemurafenib (4 weeks on 2 weeks off) compared with continuous daily dosing. Clinical case reports also suggest that interrupted dosing of BRAF inhibitors can reverse resistance to the drug s11 and improve tolerability9. Intermittent dosing can attenuate relief of upstream feedback within the MAPkinase pathway, a mechanism known to contribute to drug resistance12. In summary, both preclinical and clinical data suggest that intermittent dosing could serve to eliminate the fitness advantage of resistant cells exposed to MAPkinase inhibitors , delay onset of dis ease progression and improve tolerability. These outcome benefits might be achieved with a reduction in health care costs. The intermittent dosing concept has never been formally tested in humans, but is the rationale fo r the INTERIM randomised trial. 5.2 Choice of regimen and intermittent dosing schedule The INTERIM trial is designed to test intermittent scheduling of optimal MAPkinase therapy in a BRAF mutant advanced melanoma population. Dab+tram is a routinely available BRAF+MEK inh ibitor combination the rapy accepted as the international"

Therefore, standard continuous administration of dab+tram will be compared with an intermittent dosing schedule of these two drugs. The choice of the intermittent dosing schedule has t aken into account both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic considerations as well as acceptability to patients and physicians. Dabrafenib has a 5.2 hour half life, but generates several active metabolites which persist, while trametinib has a mean terminal half life of 5.3 days ( Trametinib Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC] ). Taken together, the preclinical data suggest that a minimum of 1 week break from BRAF inhibitor and 2 weeks break from MEK inhibitor is required to relieve inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway. The only published preclinical model of intermittent dosing is with vemurafenib: 4 weeks on 2 weeks off. Based on extensive experience using these targeted agents in the clinic as well as direct patient feedback, a 4 weekly intermittent dosing cycle has been designed for testing against standard of care: Continuous vs Intermittend Dosing cycles of Dabrafenib and Trametinib Standard Arm (continuous) Experimental Arm (intermittent) Dabrafenib 150mg bid, d1 -28 150mg bid, d1 -21 Trametinib 2mg od, d1 -28 2mg od, d1 -14 The intermittent dosing regimen aims to (1) be acceptable to patients and clinicians, (2) improve treatment tolerance, and (3) potentially overcome drug resistance thereby enhancing efficacy. 6 Rationale for the INTERIM Trial A strong scientific rationale argues for intermittent dosing of MAPkinase inhibitors. However , the concept of administering less rather than more treatment may be challenging in practice. A survey of metastatic melanoma patients receiving BRAF targeted agents identified that despite experiencing toxicity, most patients were either undecided or reluctant to consider interrupting their treatment either for 1 or 2 weeks (P Corrie, unpublished data). This feasibility trial aims to determine if intermittent dosing is deliverable , based on patient and professional willingness to take part in a randomised trial evaluating less than standard durations of treatment. The trial will evaluate treatment compliance, PFS and QoL, to inform whether a subse quent definitive trial is justified and how it should be designed . The tri al will incorporate detailed clinician and patient (using patient reported outcome measures ) evaluation of frequently occurring and problematic skin toxicities and will address the cost-effectiveness of an intermittent dosing regimen. In addition, tissue and blood samples will be collected to demonstrate proof of principle as well as to explore the role of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) as a non -invasive predi ctive biomarker in BRAF mutant melanoma."

It will be measured as the average number of patients recruited per site per 2 months • Treatment compliance is defined as the percentage of patients completing the allocated treatment at 6 months from the date of randomisation. Although the primary aim is to assess the compliance of the intermittent dosing schedule, compliance of the standard continuous dosing schedule will also be assessed and compared with the experimental arm in an exploratory manner • Overall QoL is defined as the global health status score derived from the standard EORTC QLQ- C30 questionnaire at 6 months from date of randomisation • PFS is calculated as the duration from date of randomisation to the date of first progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Progression is assessed according to standard Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST v1.1 – appendix 1 ) 7.6.2 Secondary Endpoints • Safety is assessed using the standard cancer National Cancer institute (NCI) CTCAE v4.03 criteria • Objective Response Rate is assessed according to RECIST v1.1 (Appendix 1) Time to treatment failure is the time from starting drug treatment with dabrafenib+trametinib on day 1 of cycle 1 until the date of day 1 of the las t cycle +28 days; • Overall survival is calculated as the duration from the date of randomisation to the date of death from any cause • Patient reported outcomes focussing on skin toxicity evaluation is assessed using skin -specific patient reported outcome measures (PROM ) – the Skindex -16 and NCI PRO -CTCAE • Patient experience is assessed by a) patient experience survey of patients in each arm of the trial and b) semi -structure d interviews in a subset of patient s who have volunteer ed • QoL & Health Economic E valuation : the EORTC QLQ -C30 and EQ5D generic measure of health status will be used for the cost -effectiveness analysis. 7.6.3 Exploratory Endoints Using blood and tumour tissue collected from recruited patients, we will explore: • the kinetics of BRAF mutation load in each arm of the trial"

If the patient explicitly states their wish not to contribute further data to the trial , the investigator should inform the co -ordinating centre in writing and the withdrawal of consent should be documented by the i nvestigator in the patient’s case report form (CRF). However, data and samples collected up to the time of consent withdrawal will be included in the data reported for the trial. 9 Trial Treatment s 9.1 General Principles • Patients in both arms of the trial sho uld begin their allocated treatments within 7 days from the date of randomisation. • Safety assessments including haematology and biochemistry assessments are required prior to Day 1 treatment of each cycle for the first year and every other cycle thereaft er. Safety assessments should also be performed, at the end of protocol treatment (30 days from the date of last protocol treatment dose adminis tered); Details are provided in Section 10.2 and summarised in the Schedule of Asse ssments in Section 10.7. • Dosage modifications are summari sed in Section 9.6. Specific details for the dabrafenib + trametinib regimen are given below. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that recommendations in the UK SmPCs for administration of the dabrafenib and trametinib are followed. The S mPC is updated from time to time , up-to-date UK S mPCs are posted on the Medicine Guides Website http://www.medicines.org.uk . 9.2 Investigational Medicinal products For the purpose of this trial, d abrafenib and trametinib are both considered as Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs) conducted within a Clinical Trial Authoris ation (CTA) under the Notification Scheme for Type A trials . 9.2.1 Legal status of the drugs and Risk Categorisation. The current regulatory framework in the UK/EU allows for a range of risk -adapted approaches. In this instance Dabrafenib and trametinib are both licensed for use in the UK for the treatment of BRAFV600 mutant stage 3 unresectable and metastatic melanoma."

The INTERIM trial is designed to test intermittent scheduling of optimal MAPkinase therapy in a BRAF mutant advanced melanoma population. Clinical experience shows that intermittent dosing can successfully manage drug - induced toxicity and sustain patients on BRAF targeted treatment . Intermittent dosing can attenuate relief of upstream feedback within the MAPkinase pathway, a mechanism known to contribute to drug resistance. Using the risk -categorisation method , this trial has been categorised as Type A. For further details of composition of either IMP, refer to the current version of the manufacturer’s Summary of Product Characteristics (S mPC) for the brand used, which can be accessed via the Electronic Medicines Compendium (eMC) website: http://www.medicin es.org.uk/emc. A reference copy of both S mPCs can be found in the Investigator Site Files; please note however that these may not necessarily be the most up-to-date versions. 9.3 Treatment Summary Patients will be randomised equally between the following ar ms and self administer both dabrafenib and t rametinib . 9.3.1 Standard Arm: dabrafenib + trametinib standard arm (continuous schedule) Dabrafenib taken orally 150mg twice daily 12 hours apart, on days 1 – 28 of a 28 day cycle Trametinib taken orally 2mg once dail y, on days 1 – 28 of a 28 day cycle 9.3.2 Experimental Arm: dabrafenib + trametinib experimental arm (intermittent schedule) Dabrafenib taken orally 150mg twice daily 12 hours apart, on days 1 – 21 of a 28 day cycle Trametinib taken orally 2mg once daily, on da ys 1 – 14 of a 28 day cycle 9.3.3 Duration of treatment Patients will continue on allocated treatment as long as they benefit from the treatment and it is tolerable (see section 8.6.1 for full protocol treatment with drawal criteria ) 9.3.4 Drug administration Dabrafenib Dabrafenib capsules are to be swallowed whole with water. The capsules should not be chewed or opened and should not be mixed with food or liquids due to chemical instability of dabrafenib.

All anti -cancer interventions will be recorded on trial CRFs during the on-treatment and follow -up period s. 9.9 Co-enrolment guidelines Patients who have not reached inoperable disease progression may not enrol in any other clinical p rotocol or investigational treatment trial while enrolled in this study unless observational in nature. 10 Procedure s and assessments Clinical Assessments Patients will be clinically assessed every 2 weeks during the initial 2 cycles, then prior to the begi nning of every cycle until inoperable disease progression, then 3 -monthly for a minimum of 9 months follow -up from their randomisation date. Patients remaining on treatment beyond 52 weeks may have their treatment visits and drug prescriptions extended to 8 weekly. Drug should be prescribed and dispensed on the day of the clinic visit, as per schedule of assessments (Section 10.7 ). A treatment cycle starts with the morning dose, therefore a clinic visit associat ed with the start of a new cycle may occur up to 2 days prior to day 1 of a treatment cycle. If a clinic visit is missed for medical reasons (for example, due to a hospital admission), drugs can be restarted between visits as appropriate according to wher e the patient is on their defined schedule and they should return to clinic at the next preplanned visit. If the beginning of a cycle is delayed the date when a patient is ready to restart treatmen t becomes the first day of the cycle and therefore clinic al visits should be amended in line with the new cycle pattern ie up to 2 days prior to the start of the new cycle. Please note that imaging for disease measurement must remain on the 8 -weekly calendar dates set on cycle 1 day 1. Schedule d safety assessme nts described in section 10.7 will be undertaken at scheduled clinic visits."

After starting treatment t he first scan will be at 6 weeks and then every 8 calendar weeks (±7 days) , until inoperable disease progression . Patients continuing their treatment/follow -up prior to disease progression beyond 52 calendar weeks can have the ir scanning frequency reduced to every 12 calendar weeks . The same imaging modality as the baseline scans for a patient should be used throughout the trial. At baseline, imaging must include the brain by either CT or MRI modality . Cutaneous lesions can be included for measurable disease if photographed with a ruler depicting clearly the size of target lesion (s). The same method will be used to assess response of the cutaneous lesions identified at baseline throughout the trial, that is, two tumour assessm ents (one for each method) will be performed at each planned assessment time if the ruler method is used . For patients with brain metastases at baseline, reassessment of measurable disease must include brain imaging with the same modality as at baseline. For patients with no evidence of brain metastases at baseline , regular imaging of the brain is recommended, but investigators should follow local guidance. It is recommended that the brain be imaged at least every 16 calendar weeks . Summary information on timing of interventions, procedures and assessments are given in the Schedule of Assessment in Section 10.7. Details are listed below. 10.1 Screening evaluation, pre -randomisation and randomisation procedures See section 8.4 and 8.5 . 10.2 Trial assessments 10.2.1 Timing of assessments For safety reasons, patients will attend clinic every 2 weeks in the first 8 weeks. A window of +/ - 2 days is allowed for clinic visits and associated assessments to ensure a treatment cycle starts with the morning dose, to account fo r bank holidays and other unfor eseen circumstances. For safety reasons, the first reassessment for measurable disease will be done at cycle 2 d8 – d15 (week 6) (the scan(s) can be planned for any time within an 8 day window). In order to ensure all scans are undertaken for when patients on either arm of the trial are taking tablets, subsequent scans will be every 8 calendar weeks (±7 days) thereafter ie. weeks 14, 22, 30 etc. The ‘ Treatment Patient experience survey ’ should be completed 9 months after randomisation within the trial. A subset of patients who volunteered, will be invited to take part in a semi stru ctured interv iew at a later date . 10.2.2 Cycles 1 and 2, Day 1 and Day 15 The following assessments are to be performed during cycles 1 and 2 on days 1 (prior to drug treatment) and 15:"

An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory f inding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the investigational medicinal product . Please note: Recording of all adverse events must start from the point of Informed Consent regardless of whether a patient has yet received a medicinal product . 11.1.2 Adverse reaction to an investigational medicinal product (AR) All untoward and unintended responses to an investigational medicinal product related to any dose administered. All adverse events judged by either the reporting investigator or the sponsor as having a reasonable causal relationship to a medicinal product qualify as adverse reactions. The expression reasonable causal relationship means to convey in general th at there is evidence or argument to suggest a causal relationship ."

The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event. This is not the same as “serious,” which is based on patient/event outcome or action criteria. 11.1.4 Serious adverse event or serious adverse reaction (SAE / SAR) Any untowa rd medical occurrence that at any dose : - results in death, - is life-threatening - requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existin g inpatients´ hospitalisation, - results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, - is a congenital anomaly or birth defect. - is an important medical event - Some medical events may jeopardise the patient or may require an intervention to prevent one of the above characteristics/ consequences. Such events (hereinafter referred to as ‘important medical events’) should also be considered as ‘serious’. Life-threatening in the definition of a serious adverse event or serious adverse reaction refers t o an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 11.1.5 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) A serious adverse reaction, the nature and severity of which is not consistent with the information set out in the Reference Safety Information 11.1.6 Reference Safety Information (RSI) The information used for assessing whether an adverse reaction is expected. For the INTERIM trial t he Reference Safety Information is contained in the trial- specific RSI document approved by the MHRA for use in this trial and attached as appendix 8 – Reference safety information. 11.2 Expected Adverse R eactions /Serious Adverse Reactions (AR /SARs) All exp ected Adverse Reactions are listed in the reference safety information contained in Appendix 8 as specified in section 11.1.6 .

Individual adverse events should be evaluated by the inve stigator. This includes the evaluation of its serio usness, causality and any relationship between the investigational medicinal product(s) and/or concomitant therapy and the adverse event. 11.4.1 Assessment of seriousness Seriousness is assessed against the c riteria in section 11.1.4 .This defines whether the event is an adverse event, serious adverse event or a serious adverse reaction 11.4.2 Assessment of causality Definitely: A causal relationship is clinically/biologically certain. This is therefore an Adverse Reaction Probable: A causal relationship is clinically / biologically highly plausible and there is a plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of the investigational medicinal product and there is a reasonable response on withdrawal. This is therefore an Adverse Reaction. Possible: A causal relationship is clinically / biologically plausible and there is a plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration of the investigat ional medicinal product. This is therefore an Adverse Reaction. Unlikely: A causal relation is improbable and another documented cause of the AE is most plausible. This is therefore an Adverse Event. Unrelated: A causal relationship can be definitely exclu ded and another documented cause of the AE is most plausible. This is therefore an Adverse Event. Unlikely and Unrelated causalities are considered NOT to be trial drug related Definitely, Probable and Possible causalities are considered to be trial drug related A pre -existing condition must not be recorded as an AE or reported as an SAE unless"

The Chief Investigator is responsible for ensuring the assessment of all SAEs for expectedness and relatedness is completed and the onward notification of all SAEs to the Sponsor immediately but not more than 24 hours of first notification . The sponsor has to keep detailed records of all SAEs reported to them by the trial team. The Chief Investigator is also resp onsible for prompt reporting of all serious adverse event findings to the competent authority ( e.g. MHRA) of each concerned Member State if they could: • adversely affect the health of patient s • impact on the conduct of the trial • alter the risk to benefit ratio of the trial • alter the competent authority’s authorisation to continue the trial in accordance with Directive 2001/20/EC. An adverse event or reaction that meets serious criteria, irrespective of consistency (expected or unexpected) with the current approved Reference Safety Information contained in Appendix 8 , must be reported to the Sponsor, with the exception of events listed within Section 11.3 Expected Serious Adverse Events. In the case of an SAE, the Investigator or designee must immediately: Complete a ‘Serious Adverse Event Form’ and Fax it to the CCTU- CT at Fax number: 01223 586839 The SA E form should be completed and signed by an appropriate member of the site trial team and faxed within 24 hours of becoming aware of the event to the CCTU-CT. The Principal Investigator must counter sign as soon as possible. Even if only limited information is initially available, this should be provided and faxed on an SAE form. Further details should be submitted as soon as they become available."

In addition, available autopsy data should be provided for any death occurring after this time, if there is a possibility that the death could be related to pro tocol treatment with the trial drug. Where a reported serious adverse event is judged to be both related to the IMP and unexpected (i.e. is a SUSAR), the investigator must assist the CCTU -CT by supplying all requested information to the Sponsor to allow t he appropriate regulatory timeline to be met. The CCTU- CT will inform the Research Ethics Committee (REC), the MHRA (Medicines and healthcare products r egulatory agency ) and the sponsor within the legally required time frame. 11.6 Reporting of Suspected Unexp ected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) All suspected adverse reactions related to an investigational medicinal product (the tested IMP and comparators) which occur in the concerned trial, and that are both unexpected and serious (SUSARs) are subject to e xpedited reporting. Please see Appendix 8 – Reference Safety Information (RSI) for the Reference Safety Information to be used in this trial. 11.6.1 Who should report and whom to report to? The Sponsor delegates the responsibility of n otification of SUSARs to the Chief Investigator . The Chief Investigator must report all the relevant safety i nformation previously described, to the : • Sponsor, • Competent authorities in the concerned member states (eg MHRA) • Ethics Committee in the concerne d member states The Chief Investigator shall inform all investigators concerned of relevant information about SUSARs that could adversely affect the safety of patient s. 11.6.2 When to report? 11.6.2.1 Fatal or life -threatening SUSARs All parties listed in 11.6.1 must be notified as soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar days after the trial team and Sponsor has first knowledge of the minimum criteria for expedited reporting.

For regulatory purposes, initial expedited reports should be submitted within the time limits as soon as the minimum following criteria are met: a) a suspected investigational medicinal product, b) an identifiable patient (e.g. trial patient code number), c) an adverse event assessed as serious and unexpected, and for which there is a reasonable suspected causal relationship, d) an identifiable reporting source, and, when available and applicable: - an unique clinical trial identification (EudraCT number or in case of non - Europea n Community trials the sponsor's trial protocol code number) - an unique case identification (i.e. sponsor's case identification number). 11.6.3.2 Follow -up reports of SUSARs In case of incomplete information at the time of initial reporting, all the appropriate information for an adequate analysis of causality should be actively sought from the reporter or other available sources. Further available relevant information should be reported as follow -up reports. In certain cases, it may be appropriate to conduct foll ow-up of the long -term outcome of a particular reaction. 11.6.3.3 Format of the SUSARs reports Electronic reporting is the expected method for expedited reporting of SUSARs to the competent authority . The format and content as defined by the competent authority should be adhered to. 11.7 Pregnancy Reporting All pregnancies occurring during the trial period (either the trial participant or the participant’s partner) should be reported to the Chief Investigator and the Sponsor using the relevant Pregnancy Reporting Form w ithin 24 hours of notification. Completed Preg nancy Reporting Forms must be reported using the contacts as detailed in section 11.5. Pregnancy is not considered an AE unless a negative or consequential outcome is recorded for the mother or child/foetus. If the outcome meets the serious crite ria, this would be considered an SAE. 12 Evaluation of Patient Reported Outcome, Health Economics & Patient Experience Assessments In this study the generic instrument EQ -5D will be used to evaluate global health - related quality of life and the cancer -specific instrument – EORTC -QLQ-C30 will be used to measure impact of the treatment arms on quality of life (41 -43)."

These range from common morbilliform drug eruptions to unique toxicities (such as cutan eous squamous cell carcinoma development and severe photosensitivity) to life -threatening drug reactions including Stevens Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis18. Adverse effects affecting the skin as a result of targeted therapies have significant impact on QoL, which includes emotional, psychological, social and physical well -being19. The severity of skin toxicity is often underestimated by clinicians20,21 and the visible degree of involvement may not correlate with impact on QoL. PRO instruments have the potentia l to better capture these data. While standardised assessment tools have been developed for physicians to assess severity of adverse events (e.g. NCI CTCAE), it is well recognised that there is discord between objective and subjective measures. A systemati c review reported moderate agreement at best between NCI CTCAE and PRO reporting of adverse effects in cancer clinical trials, highlighting the importance of integrating PROs with clinician reporting 22. Several PRO inst ruments have been used to evaluate skin toxicity in cancer clinical trials of targeted therapies20 and a systematic review recently evaluated PRO instruments of dermato logic adverse events associated with targeted therapies in particular19. The two PRO questionnaires used in the INTERIM trial (Skindex -16 and NCI PRO-CTCAE) were chosen based on these data. 12.1.1 Skindex -16 The Skindex -16 is a 16 -question survey developed from the longer Skindex -29 that has been validated to accurately and sensitiv ely measure how much a patient is bothered by a skin condition. It uses questions to assess how bothered a patient is by his/her skin condition on a seven -point scale (0 -6) from ‘never bothered’ (0) to ‘always bothered’ (6) and assesses health -related QoL as it pertains to three domain s of life – symptoms, emotions and functioning. The Skindex -16 has been shown to have good reproducibility (r=0.88 -0.90)23. The survey has also been tested with several targeted therapies, including epidermal growth factor rece ptor inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors and these have shown significant correlation between survey QoL scores and other outcome measures including severity grading and NCI CTCAE scores24–27. The Skindex -16 has been shown to add supplemental information regarding skin toxicity which are no t captured by CTCAE and also allows patient rating of emotional and functional burden which the CTCAE does not take into account28. The single -page length of the PRO instrument reduces patient burden29. The disadvantage is that the Skindex -16 does not specifically address toxicities of hair, nails or mu cous membranes. 12.1.2 NCI PRO -CTCAE A PRO version of the NCI CTCAE was developed by multidisciplinary collaborators with NCI and Food and Drug Administration( FDA) input in 200830 and is called the PRO - CTCAE. It consists of a library of 78 toxicities mapped to the CTCAE with up to three patient questions per toxicity. Patient questions were developed with extensive qualitative patient input including cognitive interviewing31 and quantitative evaluation of measurement properties32,33. The purpose of the PRO -CTCAE is to improve the precision and patient -centredness of symptomatic adverse even t assessment30 and for the purpose of the INTERIM trial will be limited to skin specific items. NCI PRO -CTCAE skin"

To evaluate skin toxicity in the INTERIM trial, two sources of data will be concurren tly collected using a) the Clinician Skin Toxicity Q and b) the Patient Skin Toxicity Q. The statistical plan for data analysis is detailed in section 14.2.2.1 . 12.2 Health Economics assessments The economic evalua tion will be a cost -effectiveness analysis which will compare the costs and effects of intermittent dosing compared with standard continuous dosing of oral targeted combination therapy in patients with BRAFV600 mutant stage 3 unresectable or metastatic mel anoma and will follow established guidelines as set out by NICE34. The main outcome measure for the economic evaluation will be quality adjusted life years (QALYs)35, estimated using the EuroQol EQ -5D 5L,whi ch will be administered pre-randomisation (screening visit) , day 1 of cycle 2, and then every 1 2 weeks until the end of the trial, plus at Progression . Resource use data will be collected on the two alternative treatment regimens , treatment complications (including non serious and serious adverse events), and length of stay by adding questions to the trial CRFs. Unit costs will be derived from nationally published sources such as eMIT36, the British National Formularly37 and Department of Health reference cost database38 and attached to the resource use data. We will report the cost and QoL data for each trial arm and the difference between the trial arms. Then we will cal culate the average cost and outcome on a per patient basis to produce incremental cost -effectiveness ratios for the two arms, producing an incremental cost per QALY39 This incremental analysis will be able to provide evidence on which treatment option is most likely to provide value for money for the National Health Service ( NHS) and the gre atest value for patients. Finally, we will undertake a budget impact analysis to estimate what the likely financial impact of moving to intermittent dosing is likely to be for the NHS. 12.3 Patient Experience evaluation 12.3.1 Patients who decline to enter the tri al 12.3.1.1 Patient experience survey Patient s who are approached to enter the trial but decline to participate will be invited to complete a Patient Experience Survey to explore their reasons for not participating. The questionnaire will be self -completed . 12.3.2 Trial Participants 12.3.2.1 Patient Experience Survey Patients who agree to participate in the trial will be requested to complete a Consent Process -Patient Experience survey at the first screening visit. In addition, a fter 9 months participation within the trial a sho rt Trial Treatment Patient Experience Survey will be administered to all participants.

Patients who have volunteered their contact details in section 3 of the Patient Experience Survey, will be contacted by the qualitative researcher, who will confirm they are still willin g to participate in an interview before sending them further information about the interviews and answering any questions they may have. Patients who agree to participate in the interviews will be consented by the qualitative researcher and invited to attend face -to-face / skype / telephone interviews. A convenience sample of p atients will be recruited from up to four sites. Fifteen patients will be interviewed from each arm of the trial (total 30 interviews). Patients will be informed that it is possi ble that they will not be interviewed if too many people volunteer. Patients will be selected as they volunteer consecutively and opportunistically. A dedicated qualitative researcher will lead and undertake patient interviews evaluating three main area s detailing topics covered in the Patient Experience Survey. The responses from the Consent and Trial Treatment Patient Experience Survey s will inform the interview but the interview schedule will broadly expand on the following issues: A) Trial participati on and the consent process (Consent Patient Experience Survey) a. How did you decide to consent to be a participant in the trial? b. What was your experience of being a research participant ? c. Were you given enough information prior to entering the trial ? d. What are your feelings about being randomized in a trial i.e. acceptability of the two arms of the trial in principle and in practice ? e. Overall experience of the trial B) Experience of toxicity of treatment a. What was your experience of the treatment ? b. What toxicity did you experience and what was the severity? c. What was the impact of the toxicity on your quality of life ? e.g. social impact, psychological and emotional well -being. C) Experience of Patient Skin Toxicty Q and PROMS tools a. How easy was it to complete ? b. What was the burden of completion ? c. Did the tools capture the aspects of quality of life it affected which are relevant to the patient ? d. How useful was the Patient Skin Toxicity Q ? 13 Research Blood and Tissue Samples 13.1 Translational Research Tissue and blood samples wil l be collected from all patients for analysis of ctDNA. Research blood samples (20mls , 40mls baseline ) will be taken from all 150 patient s at the following time points: Baseline (pre- treatment), 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks , 12 weeks and then every 8 weeks until progression, plus at progression."

A block of the most recent archived melano ma tumour sample (from a metastasis or primary site) will be requested at screening. Additional blocks will be collected from any patients undergoing routine surgery to remove metastatic melanoma at progression . Blood and tissue samples will be sent to Ox ford University for analysis. Please refer to the INTERIM L aboratory Manual for details of sample collection and processing procedures. 13.2 Pharmacokinetics In a subset of patients (up to 20) the pharmacokinetics of standard versus intermittent dosing schedu les will be explored. Patients who have consented to take part in the additional pharmacokinetic study wi ll have samples collected during the following visits; Cycle1, day 1 and cycle 2, day 15 (6 weeks into treatment). Blood (2mls) will be taken at the f ollowing time points: Pre-dose 30mins +/- 5mins 1hr +/- 5mins 1hr 30mins +/- 5mins 2hrs +/- 5mins 3hrs +/- 30mins 4hrs +/- 30mins 6hrs +/- 30mins 8hrs +/- 60mins In addition a blood sample (2mls) will be taken pre -dose at the beginning of cycle 3, cycle 4 and then every other cycle (cycle 6, cycle 8, cycle 10….).These samples will be taken at the same time as the translational blood samples. Finally at disease progression, 3 further blood samples (2mls) will be taken at the following time points: pre -consultation, post- consu ltation and 30 -60 minutes later. Pharmacokinetic blood samples will be sent to Oxford University for analysis. Please refer to the INTERIM Laboratory Manual for details of sample collection and processing procedures. 14 Statistics 14.1 Number of Patient s to be enrolled It is planned to recruit 150 patients (75 patients in each arm) in 18 months with a minimum of 9 months follow up from around 20 UK sites. This will provide reliable information and evidence to inform the design of a defi nitive trial which will be powered to test the hypothesis that intermittent dosing of BRAF+MEKi combination will prolong progression -free survival compared with standard continuous dosing, with fewer side effects and better quality of life for patients. Recruitment The planned recruitment period is 18 months. Recruitment will be assessed once the trial has been open for 15 months, or 15 centres have been open for 6 months, whichever is the sooner. Recruitment will be considered acceptable if 15 of the ta rget 20 sites are entering an average of 1 patient every 2 months."
45,page_45,"EudraCT number: 2016- 005228- 27 IRAS ID Number: 213113 Page 46 of 74 INTERIM Protocol Version: V1. 1 Version Date: 2 1 September 2017 The targeted recruitment rate per site is, on average, 6 patients per year. If this target is achieved, around 1000 patients could be recruited from 50 sites in 4 years indicating that a p hase III trial fully powered (see appendix 6) to detect a median improvement in progression -free survival from 12 to 15 months trial (a hazard ratio of 0.8, being less than the 50% relative reduction in death reported in the mouse model) will be feasible. Treatment compliance Approximately 13% of patients stop treatment early due to intolerable toxicity with continuous dosing schedules. An intermittent dosing schedule will not be considered feasible if the treatment compliance at 6 months is less than 60% ; it will be considered feasible if it is over 75%. With a 5% significance level (one- sided), and 80% power, 65 patients 40 are required in the intermittent dosing arm to detect a difference of ≤60% versus ≥75%. A patient leaving the trial to move to continuous dosing will constitute a failure of intermittent treatment, as will stopping for intolerable toxicity or disease progression. Quality of life QoL improvement will be assess ed primarily using the global health status derived from the EORTC QLQ- C30 questionnaire at 6 months from baseline (change from baseline in global health status score) between the standard and the experimental arms. This will be calculated as per scoring instructions in the EORTC QLQ -C30 manual41–43. Considering 80% patients will complete QoL at 6 months, a total of 150*80%= 120 patients’ data will be available. With the estimated standard deviation of 12, which is based on 465 patients at 24 weeks from the COMBI -V trial44, 120 patients will provide us a one -sided 90% confidence interval of a 5 points45 improvement (a minimum clinical meaningful improvement) under the 0 -100 scale excluding 0 (5 – 1.28*12*(1/60**0.5 + 1/60**0.5) = 1.0 >0). Estimate the hazard ratio for progression -free survival The estimated median PFS is 12 months for the standard continuous arm. Assuming a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.8 and 150 patients randomised in 18 months with a further 9 months follow up, approximately 90 PFS events will be observed based on estimated median PFS of 12 months for the standard continuous dosing schedule. This will generate a 1 -sided 90% confidence interval of the estimated HR (exp(log(0.8) + 1.28*(4/90)**0.5 = 0.995)<1 in favour of the intermittent dosing schedule should the assumption be correct. Assuming the anticipated 3 months improvement in median PFS from 12 in continuous dosing to 15 months in intermittent dosing is true, the estimated HR will be obtained based on at least 90 PFS events. If the estimated HR is less than 0.8, there is over 72% confidence (predictive power) that the planned phase III trial will test the hypothesis successfully. If the estimated HR is less than 0.75, there is over 81% confiden ce that the definitive phase III trial will test the hypothesis successfully (see appendix 6). 14.2 Statistical analysis methods 14.2.1 Analysis population The following populations will be defined for efficacy and safety analyses • Intention -to-treat Population (I TT) The ITT population is defined as all patients randomised in the trial , regardless of whether they actually received treatment. The treatment group will be analysed as randomised."

The treatment group will be analysed as treated. • Safety Population The safety population comprises all patients randomised a nd having received at least one dose of trial treat ment. The treatment group will be analysed as treated. 14.2.2 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses for this feasibility trial will be mainly descriptive. A detailed statistical analysis plan will be drafted before any analyses are performed. Briefly, recrutiment rate will be estimated based on all patients randomised and summarised as an average number of patients recruited per month per site. Treatment compliance will be analysed based on patients who have received at least one dose of protocol treatment. The treatment compliance will be compared between the arms in an explorato ry manner. Initial evidence of intermittent dosing benefit in quality of life (the estimated confidence interval of the difference of change from baseline in global health status sco re at 6 months between arms) and progression -free survival (estimated hazard ratio, together with the confidene interval) will be analysed based on intention -to-treat population and minimum treatment population. Safety analyses will be based on safety popu lation and summarised using the frequency tables and listings. 14.2.2.1 Statistical analysis PROMs Descriptive statistics will be produced, using medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) instead of means and standard deviations in cases of heavily skewed data. Th e standardized Skindex -16 questionnaire and NCI -PRO-CTCAE data will be analysed and missing data handled in accordance with their respective guidelines29,33. Proportion of patients experiencing a change from baseline for each measure as well as mean group changes will be calculated for skin toxicity. Associations between the reporting of skin toxicity between clinician and patients at the same timepoints will be explored. Associations between Skindex -16 and PRO -CTCAE scores with reported manifestations of skin toxicity will be explored. In addition, sub-group analyses based on age, gender, treatment arm, will be undertaken. Statistical sign ificance tests will be carried out if clinically signi ficant differences are observed. Independent samples t-tests will be used to compare means, and the nonparametric equivalent will be used to compare medians in the case of skewed data. Proportions will be compared using the chi -square test. Associations will be explored using multivariate regression analyses if sample size allows. 14.2.2.2 Statistical analysis Patient Experience Survey Quantitative: Data analysis of Patient Experience will be undertaken (obtain ed both from those patients who have declined to enter the trial and those who have participated) . Descriptive results will be reported and statistics will be used where relevant , using medians and IQRs instead of means and standard deviations in cases of heavily skewed data. In addition for participants, sub -group analyses based on age, gender and treatment arm, will be undertaken. Statistical signi ficance tests will be carried out if clinically signi ficant differences are observed. Independent samples t-tests will be used to compare means, and the nonparametric equivalent will be used to compare medians in the case of skewed data. Proportions will be compared using the chi -square test."

A framework analysis approach will be undertaken which will be developed from the interview schedule and from themes that emer ge during the interviews and will be conducted using NVivo V.10 qualitative analysis software. All coding will be performed by the Qualitative Researcher. Qualitative data from the interviews will be integrated with the responses from the question naires an d used to evaluate patient experience for patients who have participated in the INTERIM trial. 14.3 Interim analyses An Independent Safety Data Monitoring Committee (ISDMC) will review trial progression and trial data, by treatment group, on the safety of pa tients in the trial. The I SDMC will meet approximately every 6 months while patients are receiving protocol treatment or until end of the trial. Interim progress reports will be produced for each ISDMC meeting. 14.4 Definition of the end of the trial The tr ial will be considered closed for regulatory purposes 9 months from the date of randomisation of the last patient. Further observational follow -up on survival of all patients enrolled in the trial will be performed for a minimum of 9 months to a maximum of 5 years from the date of randomisation of the last patient , as survival beyond this point is unlikely .This will initially be via hospitals and clinics, but in the longer term may exploit national registers. 15 Data handling and record keeping 15.1 Case Report F orm ( CRF) All anonymous data will be transferred into a CRF which will be anonymised. All trial data in the CRF must be extracted from and be consistent with the relevant source documents. The CRFs must be completed, dated and signed by the investigator o r designee in a timely manner. It remains the responsibility of the investigator for the timing, completeness, legibility and accuracy of the CRF pages. The CRF will be accessible to trial coordinators, data managers , the investigators , Clinical Trial Monitors, Auditors and Inspectors as required. Completed originals of the CRFs should be posted within two weeks of the trial visit to the trial coordination centre : INTERIM Trial Coordinator Cambridge Clinical Trials Unit – Cancer Theme (CCTU- CT) Box 279 (S4 ) Addenbrooke’s Hospital Hills Road Cambridge CB2 0QQ"

A recommendation to discontinue recruitment (in all patients or in selected subgroups) will be made only if the emerging safety data indicate that the safety of the patients is not maintaine d. If a decision is made to continue, the ISDMC will advise on the frequency of future reviews of the data on the basis of accrual and event rates. The ISDMC will make recommendations to the TSC as to the continuation of the trial. The ISDMC will also be monitoring compliance of patients randomised to the intermittent arm of the trial and outcomes of both arms on a 6 monthly basis throughout the trial. 16.3 Trial Steering Committee (TSC) The TSC includes members who are independent of the trial investigators an d the CCTU-CT. It will provide overall supervision of the trial. It will meet at approximately 6- monthly intervals and will receive reports from the CCTU- CT, TMG and ISDMC. 17 Ethical & Regulatory considerations 17.1 Consent The Informed Consent form must be appr oved by the REC and must be in compliance with GCP, local regulatory requirements and legal requirements. The investigator must ensure that each trial participant, or his/her legally acceptable representative , is fully informed about the nature and objecti ves of the trial and possible risks associated with their participation. The investigator will obtain written informed consent from each patient or the patient ’s legally acceptable representative before any trial -specific activity is performed. The inform ed consent form used for this trial and any change made during the course of this trial, must be prospectively approved by the REC . The investigator will retain the original of each patients signed informed consent form. Should a patient require a verbal translation of the trial documentation by a locally approved interpreter/translator , it is the responsibility of the individual investigator to use locally approved translators. Any new information which becomes available, which might affect the patient’ s willingness to continue participating in the trial will be communicated to the patient as soon as possible. If the pa tient’s next trial visit is imminent the new information will be communicated in person at that trial visit. Otherwise, the pa tient will be contacted over the telephone by a member of the trial team, eg. Investigator or Research Nurse. 17.2 Ethical committee review Befor e the start of the trial or implementation of any amendment we will obtain approval of the trial protocol, protocol amendment s, informed consent forms and other relevant documents e.g., advertisements and GP information letters if applicable from the REC. All correspondence with the REC will be retained in the Trial Master File/Investigator Site File. Annual reports will be submitted to the REC in accordance with national requirements. It is the Chief Investigator ’s responsibility to produce the annual reports as required. 17.3 Regulatory Compliance The trial will not commence until a CTA under the Notification Scheme for Type A tr ials is obtained from the MHRA . The protocol and trial conduct will comply with the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004 and any relevant amendments."

It is the Chief Investigators responsibility to produce the annual reports as required. 17.4 Protocol Amendments Protocol amendments must be reviewed and agreement received from the Sponsor for all proposed amendments prior to su bmission to the HRA, REC and/or MH RA. The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to REC and/or MHRA approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent, immediate risks to the patients (Urgent Safety Measures) . In this case, accrual of new patients will be halted until the HRA, REC and/or MHRA approval has been obtained. In the event of an urgent safety measure , the chief investigator (or delegate) will cascade the information verbally and/or by email to each participa ting site within 24 hours . 17.5 Peer Review This clinical trial has been peer reviewed by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR ) Research for Patient Benefit (RfPB ) funding committee. 17.6 Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practic e The trial will be performed in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the declaration of Helsinki, the conditions and principles of Good Clinical Practice , the protocol and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws. 17.7 GCP Training All trial staff must hold evidence of appropriate GCP training or undergo GCP training prior to undertaking any responsibilities on this trial. This training should be updated every 2 years or in accordance with your Trust’s policy. 18 Sponsorship, Financial and Insurance The tri al is sponsored by Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. The main trial will be funded by an NIHR RfPBgrant. The translational research and Pharmacokinetics will be funded by a CRUK grant. Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust , as a member of the NHS Clinical Negligence Scheme for Trusts, will accept full financia l liability for harm caused to participants in the clinical trial caused through the negligence of its employees and honorary contract holders. There are no specific a rrangements for compensation s hould a participant be harmed through participation in the trial, but no -one has acted negligently. 19 Monitoring, Audit & Inspection The investigator must make all trial documentation and rel ated records available should an M HRA Inspection occur. Should a monitoring visit or audit be requested, the investigator must make the trial documentation and source data available to the Sponsor’s representative. All patient data must be handled and treated confidentially . The Sponsor’s monitoring frequency will be determined by an initial risk assessment performed prior to the start of the trial. A detailed monitoring plan will be generated"

Throughout the course of the t rial, the risk assessment will be reviewed and the monitoring frequency adjusted as necessary. Remote monitoring will be conducted for all participating sites. The scope and frequency of the monitoring will be determined by the risk assessment and detaile d in the Monitoring Plan for the trial. 20 Protocol Compliance and Breaches of GCP Prospective, planned deviations or waivers to the protocol are not allowed under the UK regulations on Clinical Trials and must not be used. Protocol deviations, non -complia nces, or breaches are departures from the approved protocol. They can happen at any time, but are not planned. They must be adequately documented on the relevant forms and reported to the Chief Investigator and Sponsor immediately. Deviations from the p rotocol which are found to occur constantly again and again will not be accepted and will require immediate action and could potentially be classified as a serious breach . Any p otential/suspected serious breach es of GCP must be repo rted immediately to th e Sponsor without any delay. 21 Publications policy Ownership of the data arising from this trial resides with the TMG. On completion of the trial the data will be analysed and tabulated and a Final Trial Report prepared. The main trial results will be pre sented at national and international conferences and published in a peer -reviewed journal, on behalf of all collaborators. All presentations and publications relating to the trial must be authorised by the TMG. The manuscript will be prepared by a writing group appointed from amongst the TMG and high -accruing investigators. The CCTU -CT, NIHR, CRUK and all participating sites and Investigators will be acknowledged in publications and presentations. Senior authorship shall be shared between members of the TM G according to their leadership role in the trial . Priority will be given to the lead sites (Cambridge and Oxford) co - ordinating the trial, then to participating sites, ordered by recruitment. In addition patients who have consented to receive updates on trial progress and results of t he trial, will be provided with trial updates and summary of the results in lay terms."

A summary of the criteria applicable for INTERIM is given below. Methods of Assessment Tumour assessments for response and progression require CT scan (or MRI if allergic to intravenous contrast) of thorax/abdomen/pelvis/head or measured by photography including a ruler . The same assessment technique should be used to characterise each identified and reported lesion at baseline and throughout the trial. Measurable Disease Patients will be classified as having measurable or n on-measurable disease at baseline and at each imagining assessment. Definition of Measurable Disease lesions Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of 10 mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm; when CT scans have slice thickness >5 mm, the minimum size should be twice the slice thickness). Cutaneous lesions measured by photography including a ruler to indicate size, must be a minimum of 10mm in diameter. Malignant l ymph nodes: To be considered pathologically enlarged and measured, a lymph node must be ≥15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan. At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. Definition of Non -measurable lesions Non-measurable lesions are all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with 10 to <15 mm short axis), as well as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered truly non -measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques. Base line Tumour Assessment The baseline tumour assessment evaluation should be performed within 4 weeks of date of randomisation."

Sum of the Diameters Sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. Non-target Lesions All lesions (or sites of dis ease) not identified as target lesions, including pathological lymph nodes and all non -measurable lesions, should be identified as non -target lesions and be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these lesions are not required and they should be followed a s ‘present’, ‘absent’ or in rare cases, ‘unequivocal progression’. Response Criteria Evaluation of Target Lesions Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reducti on in short axis to <10 mm. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target l esions, taking as reference the smallest sum on trial (this may include the baseline sum). The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. Evaluation of Non -target Lesions Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalisation of tumour marker levels. All lymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis)."

Progressive Disease (PD): Unequivocal progression of existing non -target lesions. • When patient has measurable disease. To achieve ‘unequivocal progres sion’ on the basis of the non -target disease, there must be an overall level of substantial worsening in non -target disease such that, even in presence of SD or PR in target disease, the overall tumour burden has increased sufficiently to merit discontinua tion of therapy. A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non -target lesions is not usually sufficient to qualify for unequivocal progression status. • When patient has only non -measurable disease. There is no measurable disease assessment to factor i nto the interpretation of an increase in non -measurable disease burden. Because worsening in non -target disease cannot be easily quantified, a useful test that can be applied is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on change in non -measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease. Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’ or an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to wi despread. New lesions The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression: • The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e., not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in imaging modality or findings thought to represent something other than tumour, especially when the patient’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response). • If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, continued therapy and follow -up evaluation will clarify if it r epresents truly new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan. • A lesion identified on a follow -up study in an anatomical location that was not scanned at basel ine is considered a new lesion and disease progression."
