9,page_9,"I4V-MC-JAHM(b)Clinical Protocol Page 9 LY30091041.Synopsis Title of Study: A Multicenter, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled, Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Baricitinib in Patients with Moderate to Severe Atopic Dermatitis Rationale: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a pruritic, chronic or chroni cally relapsing, highly symptomatic inflammatory skin disease characterized by excessive T cell activation leading to significant skin infiltration by T -cells and dendritic cells (Bieber 2010) . Presentation is varied, but includes ski n manifestations and pruritus, with associated sleep disturbances and subsequent skin infections. The course of disease includes relapses of varying duration and severity . Baricitinib is an orally available, selective Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor with potency and selectivity for JAK1 and JAK2 and less potency for JAK3 or tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) (Fridman et al. 2010 ). The pathogenesis of AD is thought to be modulated through t hymic stro mal ly mphopoietin (TSLP) , interleukin (IL) -13, IL-4, IL-5, IL-22, and IL-31, many of which activate receptors with downstream signaling through intracellular JAK1/JAK2 /TYK2 (Nomura and Kabashima 2015 ). This activity profile suggests that bariciti nib may inhibit cytokines involved in AD pathogenesis . Clinical studies have established that baricitinib is effective in autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases involving the joints, kidneys, and skin. Baricitinib was effective at reducing swollen and tender joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (Genovese et al. 2016; Dougados et al. 2017; Fleischmann et al. 2017; Taylor et al. 2017); was effective at reducing disease severity in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (Papp et al. 2016 ); was effective at reducing the urinary albumin -to-creatinine ratio in patients with diabetic kidney disease (Tuttle et al. 2015 ); and in a recently completed Phase 2 study (I4V -MC-JAHG) was effect ive at reducing disease severity in patients with moderate to severe AD . The mechanism of action, combined with demonstration of clinical b enefit in inflammatory diseases involving joints, kidneys, and skin, provides the rationale for evaluating baricitinib in moderate to severe AD. Objective(s)/Endpoints: Objectives Endpoints Primary To test the hypothesis that baricitinib 4 -mg QD or baricitinib 2 -mg QD is superior to placebo in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe AD.Proportio n of patients achieving IGA of 0 or 1 with a ≥2-point improvement at Week 16. Key Secondary These are prespecified objectives that will be adjusted for multiplicity To test the hypothesis that baricitinib 1-mg QD is superior to placebo in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe AD.Proportio n of patients achieving IGA of 0 or 1 with a ≥2-point improvement at Week 16."

Summary of Study Design: Study I4V -MC-JAHM (JAHM) is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, outpatient study evaluating the efficacy and safety of baricitinib 4 -mg once daily (QD), 2 -mg QD, and 1 -mg QD as compared to placebo in adult patients with moderate to severe AD. The study population will include patients aged 18 years or older who have moderate to severe AD and a history of inadequate respon se or intolerance to existing topical therapies. The study duration will be up to 25 weeks over 3 study periods: Period 1: Screening Period lasting from 8 to 35 days prio r to Week 0 (baseline, Visit 2). Period 2: Double -Blinded Treatment Period, lasting from Week 0 (baseline, Visit 2) through Week 16 (Visit 8) inclusive: oAt completion of the double -blind treatment period, patients will be provided the option to participate in the long -term extension study I4V-MC-JAHN (JAHN). Those not eligible or who cho se not to participate will proceed to the post -treatment follow -up period. Period 3: Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period, spanning the period from the last treatment visit at Week 16 (Visit 8) or Early Termination Visit (ETV) to approximately 4 weeks followin g the last dose of investigational product. Treatment Arms and Duration: Patients will be randomized at Week 0 to 1 of 4 treatment groups: placebo once daily (QD) , baricitinib 1 -mg QD, baricitinib 2 -mg QD, or baricitinib 4 -mg QD. The study duration will be up to 25 weeks (Screening Period: up to 5weeks prior to randomization; Double -Blinded Treatment Period: 16weeks; Follow -up Period: approximately 4weeks after the last dose of investigational product ). Number of Patients: This study will include ap proximately 600 patients with AD who will be randomi zed 2:1:1:1 to placebo QD or 1 of 3 dose groups of baricitinib (1 -mg QD, 2 -mg QD, or 4 -mg QD) (240 patients in the placebo arm; 120 patients in each baricitinib treatment group). Statistical Analysis: Unless otherwise specified, the efficacy and health outcome analyses will be conducted on the intent -to-treat populatio n and safety analy ses will be conducted on those patients who receive at least 1 dose of investigational product."

Additional analyses will be done using all observed data whether rescue medication was used or not. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and health outcome variable s will be made using mixed -effects model of repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, region, baseline severity , visit, and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed categorical effects and baseline score and baseline score -by-visit interaction as fixed conti nuous effects. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the within -patient variance –covariance errors. TypeIII sums of squares for the least squares means (LSMs) will be used for the statistical comparison and c ontrasts will be set up wit hin the model to compare treatment groups at specific time points of interest . Fisher exact test will be used for all adverse events (AEs), baseline, discontinuation, and other categorical safety data. Continuous vital signs and laboratory values will be analy zed by an analy sis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and baseline values in the model."

At Visit 5 (Week 4) and Visit 8 (Week 16), these 2 doses should be the dose given the morning of the day of sample collection and the dose given the pr evious day. At Visit 6 (Week 8) and Visit 7 (Week 12) , the 2 previous doses should be the dose taken yesterday and the dose taken the day before that. This sampling schedule should be followed as closely as possible; however, failure to take PK samples a t these specified times will not be considered a protocol violation."

Background Atopic derm atitis (AD), also known as eczema or atopic eczema, is a commo n, chronic, relapsing, highly symptomat ic inflammatory skin disease (Bieber 2010 ). Pati ents wi th AD may present with skin lesions that can be acute with oozing, crusted, eroded vesicles or papules on erythematous pl aques. Pati ents m ay also present with lesio ns that have a suba cute appearance, with thick and excoriated plaques, or chronic appearance, with lichenified, slight ly pigmented, excori ated pl aques (Bieber 2010 ). Atopic dermat itis causes pruritus attacks throughout the day , which is the prim ary source of m orbidity in this disorder (Simpson 2012 ). Pruri tus of ten leads to an “itch–scratch” cy cle, further compromising the epi dermal barri er and result ing in dry skin, microbial co lonizat ion, and secondary infect ions (Krakowski et al. 2008 ), with 36% of patients reporting that they often or al ways scratch unt il their skin bleeds (Langenbruch et al. 2014 ). Pruri tus fro m ADcan worsen at night, result ing in sleep disturbances, with approximately 27% of adult pati ents wi th AD experiencing sleep disturbance as a result of itching (Langenbruch et al. 2014 ). In adult patients with moderate to severe AD, sleep qualit y and l atency were significant ly associ ated wi th poor quali ty oflife (QoL) (Yano et al. 2013 ). In clinical pract ice, AD is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on a variet y of clinical features, including severit y of skin lesi ons and pruri tus, and extent of disease (body surface ar ea [BSA] invo lved) . Until recent ly, there were no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved systemic treatm ents for pati ents wi th moderate to severe AD, with the exception of systemic corticosteroi ds. In March 2017, Dupixent (dupilumab) inject ion, a IgG4 monoclonal ant ibody that inhibits interleukin (IL) -4 and IL -13, was approved by the FDA for thi s pat ient populat ion. In the European Unio n, only cycl osporine has been approved for the treatment of patients with severe AD (Bieber and Straeter 2015 ). A recent ly completed Phase 2 study (I4V -MC-JAHG [JAHG]) evaluated the safe ty and efficacy of baricit inib (Janus kinase [JAK] inhibitor) in AD and results showed si gnificant improvement in disease severit y compared to pl acebo and no new safet y concerns were i dentified . In addit ion to AD, baricit inib has also been studied in Phase 3 in pat ients with rheumatoi d arthri tis (RA) and in Phase 2 in pati ents wi th diabeti c nephropathy , moderate to severe p soriasis, and systemic lupus ery thematosus . Through 04June 2016, baricit inib has been studied in more than 450 heal thy vol unteers and 4200 pati ents have received baricit inib in cli nical studi es. Of these, m ore than 2400 patients have been treated with baricit inib for more than a year and more than 900 patients have been treated with baricit inib for more than 2 years at doses of 2 -mg QDand/or 4 -mg QDacross the RA clinical program. Baricit inib has been administered as single doses ranging from 1 -to 40-mg and as repeat oral doses ranging fro m 2-to 20 -mg to healt hy subjects . Bari citinib has also been administered to patients with RA at doses up to 15 -mg daily for 4 weeks, 10 -mg daily for 24weeks, 8 -mg daily for 76 weeks, and lower doses up to 4 -mg daily for up to approximately 5years ."
19,page_19,"I4V-MC-JAHM(b)Clinical Protocol Page 19 LY30091043.2. Study Rationale The underlying cause of AD is not com pletely understood. Loss of function mutations in filaggrin (filament aggregation protein) gene, a key protein in terminal different iation of the epidermis contribut ing to barrier funct ion, has been identified as the strongest genetic ris k factor for AD in European populat ions (Palmer et al. 2006 ). At a cellular level, AD is characterized by excessive T cell act ivation caused by genetic and environmental factors, leading to significant skin infiltrat ion by T cells and dendrit ic cells. The cy tokine thymic stromal lymphopoiet in (TSLP) is thought to act as a master switch that triggers the init iation and m aintenance of AD (Moni aga et al . 2013 ; Ziegler et al. 2013 ). Overexpressio n of TSLP in kerat inocytes, the most prevalent cell t ype in the skin, triggers robust itch -evoked scratching and the development of an AD-like skin phenoty pe in mice (Li et al. 2005 ). In addit ion to di rectly inducing itc h by activat ing sensory neurons in the skin, TSLP also enhances maturation and different iation of dendrit ic cells and naive CD4+ T cells and induces production of Th2 -related cy tokines invo lved in AD pathogenesis (Wilso n et al . 2013 ; Dive kar and Kita 2015 ). Thymic stromal lymphopoiet in and other key cytokines involved in AD pathogenesis, such as IL -13, IL -5, IL -22, and IL -31, signal through receptors associated with intracellular JAK1/JAK2/tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) -signaling (Ziegler et al. 2013 ; Nom ura and Kabashima 2015 ). Janus kinases are a family o f tyrosine kinases that mediate cy tokine receptor signaling through phosphorylat ion and activat ion of signal transducers and activators of transcript ion (STAT) proteins. There are 4 known JAK family members: JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2 (Clark et al . 2014 ). The relat ive affinit y of JAK inhibitors for different members of the JAK kinase family allows for different iation of JAK inhibitors in relatio n to thei r enzymat ic inhibitory profile. In vitro assa ys indicate that baricit inib is a select ive inhibitor of JAKs with potency and select ivity for JAK1/2 and less potency for JAK3 or TYK2 (Fri dman et al . 2010 ). The balanced JAK1/JAK2 inhibitory profile o f baricit inib su ggests that baricit inib will have the greatest modulatory effect in cy tokines signaling through a JAK1/JAK2 heterodimer intracellularly (or a JAK1/JAK2/TYK2), such as IL -6, TSLP , IL-13, or IL -31(Vaddi and Luchi 2012 ). The recent ly co mpleted Phase 2 study of baricit inib in AD, JAHG, met its primary object ive of proporti on of patients achieving a 50% improvement fro m baseline in EASI scores compared to placebo . Bari citinib also showed statist ically significant improvements for other disease severit y analyses as well as mult iple different patient -reported outcome (PRO) scales compared to placebo, further validat ing the hypothesis that JAK1/JAK2 signaling plays a key ro le in AD pathogenesis . 3.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment More informat ion about the known and expected benefits, risks, serious adverse events (SAEs) and re asonably ant icipated adverse events (AEs) of baricit inib are to be found in the Invest igator’s Brochure (IB)."

Overall Design Study I4V-MC-JAHM (JAHM ) is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, doubl e-blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, outpati ent study evaluat ing the efficacy and safet y of baricit inib 1 -mg once daily (QD), 2 -mg QD, and 4 -mg QD as compared to placebo in adult patients wi th moderate to severe AD. The study is divided into 3 periods, a 5 -week Screening period, a 16 -week Double -Blinded Treatm ent period, and a 4 -week Post -Treatment Follow -Up period. For those patients who complete the 16 -week treatm ent peri od, there is an option to participate in the long -term extensio n study I4V-MC-JAHN (JAHN). Approximately 600 pati ents ≥18years of age who have responded inadequately to or who are intolerant to topical therapy will be randomized at a 2:1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo QD, baricit inib 1 -mg QD, baricit inib 2 -mg QD, or baricit inib 4 -mg QD ( 240 patients in the placebo group; 120 patients in each baricit inib treatment group). Patients will be stratified at rando mizat ion according to disease severit y (Investi gator’s Gl obal Assessment [ IGA] 3 vs. 4) and geographic region. All procedures to be conducted during the study , including timing of all procedures, are indicated in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). Secti on9.4.4 describes co llection of laboratory samples; Appendix 2 , Appendix 4 , and Appendix 5 list the specific laboratory tests that will be perform ed for this study . Study governance considerations are described in detail in Appendix 3 . Secti on10.3.7.1 outlines informat ion regarding the data monitoring co mmittee (DMC) and interim analyses. 5.1.1. Period 1: Screening The durati on of the Screening Period is between 8 and 35 days pri or to Visit 2 (Week 0). At Visit1 the pati ent will sign the inform ed consent form (ICF) pri or to any study assessments, examinat ions, or procedures being performed (see Appendix 3 ). All screening procedures will be perform ed according to the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on2). Patients who receive a purified protein derivat ive (PPD) skin test at Visit 1 will need to return within 48 to 72hours later to read the skin test. Prior to randomizat ion, treatm ents for AD will be washed out: 4 weeks for systemic treatments and 2 weeks for topical treatments (not including emo llients). Patients will be required to use emo llients daily during the 14 days preceding randomization and throughout the study . If patients have been using emollients daily at the tim e of screening ,then those cumulative days are utilizable to meet inclusio n criteri on [8]. Addit ionally , collection of data through daily diaries and act igraphy devices will be required through outthe screening period. The bas eline for the daily PRO and act igraphy asses sments will be the average score of the 7days prior to randomization; thus the minimum screening window was set at 8 days. All patients who have not previously received the herpes zoster vaccine by screening w ill be encouraged (per local guidelines) to do so prior to rando mizat ion.

End of Study Definition End of the study is the date of the last visit or last scheduled procedure shown in the Schedule o f Activities(Secti on2) for the last patient. 5.4. Scientific Rationale for S tudy Design This study will enroll m oderate to severe AD patients with a history of inadequate response or intolerance to exi sting topical therapies for whom a systemic treatment such as baricit inib may therefore be appropriate. During the screening period (Peri od1), a washout of systemic and topical treatments for AD was incorporated prior to randomizat ion to minimize confounding effects due to background treatm ent. The double -blind, pl acebo -controlled treatment period (Period 2) is designed to minimize bias in the evaluat ion of the efficacy and safet y of 3baricit inib doses, relat ive to placebo, through 16 weeks of treatment. In consideration o f the disease severit y, all patients in Study JAHM are eligible for rescue to TCS. Invest igators are allowed to rescue patients who are experiencing unacceptable or worsening symptoms of AD. Once rescue medicatio n is used, the patient will be determined to be a nonresponder (See Section 7.7.3 ). Invest igator’s Global Assessments are commonly used in clinical trials, both for qualifying patients f or enrollment and for evaluat ing treatment efficacy (Langley et al. 2015 ; Futam ura et al . 2016 ). There is no single “gold standard” disease severit y scale for AD; however, IGA scales provi de clinically meaningful measures to patients and invest igators that are easily describ ed and that correspond to disease severit y categori es (e.g., m oderate to severe). The scale that will be used in this trial, the validated Invest igator’s Global Assessment of Atopic Dermat itis (vIGA -AD, referred to throughout the protocol as IGA), has bee n developed internally and assesses AD severit y using a 5 -point scale. A 2:1:1:1 randomizat ion scheme of placebo, 1 -mg baricit inib, 2 -mg baricit inib, and 4 -mg baricit inib was implemented because increased placebo enro llment across treatment groups has been reported to decrease placebo response and to also increase statist ical power (Mallinckrodt 2011). The 16 -week efficacy endpoint was chosen because it is likely that a robust clinical effect will be observed wit h bari citinib wit hin this timeframe based on our Phase 2 study resul ts in AD and from previ ous studi es in another inflammatory skin condit ion. The Post -Treatment Follow -Up Peri od (Peri od3) is for safet y monitoring after the patient has been o ff invest igational product for approximately 28 days."
26,page_26,"I4V-MC-JAHM(b)Clinical Protocol Page 26 LY30091045.5. Justification for Dose The doses proposed for AD Phase 3 studi es are baricit inib 1 -mg, 2 -mg, and 4 -mg QD. These doses were chosen primarily based on the recently completed Phase 2 AD study , JAHG, and are additionally supported by PK, safet y, and efficacy data for baricit inib in Phase 2 and Phase 3 RA studi es and a Phase 2 psoriasis study . In the Phase 2 Study JAHG, both the 2 -mg and 4 -mg doses showed benefit on the primary and major secondary endpoints (EASI, IGA, SCORAD, POEM and DLQI) as compared to placebo, and both doses had an acceptable safet y profile at Week 16. However, the 4 -mg dose appeared to demonstrate a more rapid benefit (at 4 weeks) on the more stringent endpo ints (EASI75, EASI90, and IGA 0 or 1) compared to 2 -mg dose particularly in the subgroup of pat ients with baseline EASI scores ≥16. The 4 -mg dose resulted in stat istically significant improvement in these endpo ints at Week 4 and thi s level of response was m aintained through Week 16. A similar trend between the baricit inib 4 -mg and 2 -mg doses was observed in pat ients with RA. Although in Study JAHG the 4 -mg dose s eemed to perform better than the 2 -mg dose on more stringent endpo ints, on other endpo ints, including EASI -50, and EASI change from baseline, 2-mg and 4 -mg doses showed similar efficacy compared to placebo. Thus based on available data, 3 doses will be in cluded in Phase 3, incl uding a 1 -mg dose, to cover the range of exposures where clinical responses could be anticipated 5.5.1. Dose Adjustment for Renal Impairment Baricitinib exposure increases with decreased renal funct ion. Based on PK sim ulations of baricit inib exposures for the mild and moderate categories o f renal funct ion (stratified as estimated glo merular filtrat ion rate [eGFR] 60 to <90 mL/min/1.73 m2and eGFR 30 to <60mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively), dose adjust ment is not required f or pati ents wi th eGFR ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Pati ents wi th eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2who are randomized to the 4 -mg dose will receive a dose of 2 –mg QD, which will ensure that exposures do not exceed those of the 4-mg QD dose in pat ients with eGFR ≥60mL/min/1 .73 m 2. For pati ents randomized to the 2-mg dose or 1 -mg dose, there will be no dose correction based on renal function. The dose adjustm ent for renal impairment will be managed by interact ive web -response system (IWRS) to ensure m aintenance of the treat ment blind. This study will not enroll pat ients with screening eGFR <40mL/min/1.73 m2. See Secti on 8.1.1 for eGFR thresholds that trigger interr uption of investigat ional product. The procedure of dose adjust ment based on renal funct ion (eGFR) during the study is detailed in Secti on7.2.2 ."

Patients will be provided instructions on use and when to bring the devices back to study site based on Schedul e of Activities (Secti on2). If devices are not worn as instructed, it will not be considered a protocol vio lation. 7.2. Method of Treatment Assignment Patients who m eet all cri teria for enrollment will be randomized in a 2:1:1:1 ratio (placebo, baricit inib 1 -mg; baricit inib 2 -mg; barici tinib 4 -mg) to double -blind treatment at Visit 2 (Week 0). Randomization will be stratified by geographic regi on (Europe [EU], Japan [JPN], rest-of-world [ROW]) and di sease severi ty at baseline ( IGA 3 vs. 4). Assignment to treatment groups will be determ ined by a com puter -generated random sequence using an IWRS. The IWRS will be used to assign blister packs, each containing double -blind invest igational product tablets to each patient, starting at Visit 2 (Week 0), and at each visit up to and including Vi sit7 (Week 12). Si te personnel will confirm that they have l ocated the correct blister packs by entering a confirmat ion number found on the blister packs into the IWRS. 7.2.1. Selection and Timing of Doses The invest igational product (3 tablets fro m blister pac k) shoul d be taken once daily without regard to food and, if possible, at approximately the same t ime every day ,usually at the start of the pati ent’s day , to aid pati ent com pliance. Refer to Section 9.5, Pharm acokinet ics, for specific instructi ons on dose timing at certain visits where a PK sample is drawn. 7.2.2. Dose Adjustment for Renal Impairment The rati onale of dose adjust ment for pati ents wi th docum ented renal impairment (defined as screening eGFR ≥40 to <60 mL/min/1.73 m2) is detailed in Sect ion5.5.1 . The dose adjust ment for renal impairment will be managed by IWRS to ensure maintenance of the treatment blind. The eGFR value from the screening visit (Visit 1) will be entered into IWRS atVisit 2, and IWRS will assign the treatment doses accordingly. Patients wi th docum ented renal impairment (defined as screening eGFR ≥40 to <60mL/min/1.73 m2), who are randomized to the 4 -mg active treatment arm will receive a dose of 2-mg QD by the IWRS. For patients randomized to the 2 –mg dose or 1 –mg dose, there will be no dose adjust ment based on renal funct ion."
38,page_38,"I4V-MC-JAHM(b)Clinical Protocol Page 38 LY3009104No dose adjust ment will be made for patients with screening eGFR ≥60mL/min/1.73 m2. These patients who are randomized to active treatment w ill receive their assigned dose, either baricit inib 4 –mg, 2–mg, or 1 mg, respect ively. During the study , for pati ents wi th docum ented renal impai rment when the subsequent eGFR falls <30 mL/min/1.73 m2, invest igational product will be wit hheld unt il their eGFR beco mes ≥40mL/min/1.73 m2, whereupon the invest igational product dosing may resume.

Blinding This is a double -blind study . To preserve the blinding of the study , a minimum number of Lilly personnel will see the rando mizat ion table and treatment assignments before the study is complete. All study assessments will be performedby study personnel who are blinded to the patient’s treatment group. Except in clinical circumstances where unblinding is required, the patients, invest igators, Lilly study team, and any personnel interact ing direct ly wit h pat ients or investigat ive sites will remain blinded to baricit inib an d placebo assi gnment until after completion of the Double -Blinded Treatm ent Peri od. It i s expected that the need for unblinding a pati ent’s treatm ent pri or to com pletion of the Double -Blinded Treatm ent Peri od will be extrem ely rare. Every effort shoul d be made to preserve the blind unless there is a compelling reason that knowledge of the specific treatment would alter the medical care of the patient. In case of an emergency , the investi gator has the sol e responsibilit y for determining if unblinding of a patient’s treatm ent assignment i s warranted for medical management of the event. Patient safet y must al ways be the first considerat ion in making such a determinat ion. If a patient’s treatm ent assi gnment i s unblinded, Lilly must be notified immediately . If the invest igator decides that unblinding is warranted, it is the responsibilit y of the investi gator to prom ptly docum ent the decisio n and rat ionale and notify Lilly as soon as possible. Emergency unblinding for AEs m ay be perform ed through the IWRS . Th is option may be used ONLY if the patient’s well -being requires knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment. All unblinding events are recorded and reported by the IWRS . If an invest igator, site personnel performing assessments, or patient is unblind ed, the pati ent m ust be di scont inued fro m the study . In cases where there are ethical reasons to have the patient remain in the study , the investigator must obtain specific approval fro m a Lilly clinical research physician for the patient to con tinue in the study . Processes to maintain blinding during the interim analysis conducted by the DMC are described in Section 10.3.7.1 . 7.4. Dosage Modification Not applicable ."

Follow storage and handling instructions on the investigational pr oduct packaging. 7.6. Treatment Compliance Patient com pliance wi th study medicat ion will be assessed at each visit during the treatment period (Vi sit3 through Visit 8) by counting returned tablets. A pat ient will be considered significant ly nonco mpliant if he or she misses more than 20% of the prescribed doses of invest igational product during the study , unless the pati ent’s invest igational product is withheld by the invest igator for safet y reasons. Similarly , a pati ent will be considered significant ly noncom pliant if he or she is judged by the investi gator to have intent ionally or repeatedly taken 20% more than the prescribed amount of medicat ion during the study .

Rescue Therapy Criteria for rescue therapy initiation: Invest igators should attempt to manage patients with emo llients, however, invest igators are allowed to rescue patients who are experiencing unacceptable o r worsening symptoms of AD at any time. Prior to rescue, it is reco mmended that increased frequency of emo llient use is attem pted to at l east twi ce a day or m ore in an effo rt to con trol symptom s. The rati onale for rescue will be documented. Choice of rescue therapy treatment Triamcino lone 0.1% cream and/or hy drocorti sone 2.5% ointment. Where possible b oth these treatments will be supplied by the sponsor. In the event where providing 1 or both of these topi cal formulations is not possible, an alternate, equivalent potency TCS cream and/orointment may be provi ded by the sponsor . TCS use, supplied by the sponsor, shoul d be recorded vi a weight of returned tubes as indicated in the S chedule of Activities (Secti on2). oIn the event that the sponsor is unable to supply TCS, commercially available triamcino lone 0.1% cream and/or hy drocorti sone 2.5% ointment may be supplied by the sites . Where providi ng tri amcino lone 0.1% cream and/or hy drocortisone 2.5% ointment is not possible, an equivalent -potency TCS cream and/or ointment that is in line wit h local pract ices can be supplied. Refer to Appendix 7 for guidance on potency equivalence ."

Refer to Appendix 7 for guidance on potency equivalence . Invest igators may also select to use T CNIs and/or crisaborole where approved , although use of eit her during the study is neit her encouraged nor provided . If TCNIs are prescribed, use should be limited to problem areas only (e.g., face, neck, fo lds, genital areas, etc.). On the days of study visits, topi cal therapy shoul d not be applied before the patient has undergone all study procedures and clinical evaluat ions in order to allow adequate assessment of skin dryness Patients rescued by topical therapy will continue to take invest igational prod uct and use of rescue therapy will be docum ented in the eCRF . In pati ents who do not improve sufficient ly wit h the provided rescue topical therapy after 7 days, a higher potency TCS m ay be used (see Appendix 7 ) and invest igational product may continue. Higher potency TCS will not be supplied centrally by the sponsor. It i s recommended that if a patient reaches “clear” to “almo st clear” skin after topical rescue, then medium -and/or high-potency TCS and TCNI shoul d be stopped, and low –potency TCS (e.g., hy drocorti sone 2.5% ointment) should be used once daily for an addit ional 7 days, then stopped. If lesio ns return, patients can be retreated with TCS wi th or wi thout TCNIs and/or crisaborole as before at the discret ion of the invest igator. If topi cal rescue therapy as described above fails to sufficient ly control AD symptoms, then oral systemic medicat ions may be used as rescue (e.g., corticosteroid s, cycl osporine, m ethotrexate); however, investigational product will be required to be permanent ly discont inued for the remainder of the 16 -week study durati on. If these medicat ions are needed for other medical condi tions (e.g., asthma flare), they will still be treated as rescue medicat ions. These patients are still eligible to enter the long -term extensi on study (JAHN), if they com plete the schedule of study visits through Vi sit8 (Week 16) and are also able to complete a minimum 4 -week washout from oral systemic rescue medicat ions (which can occur during the screening period for Study JAHN). Invest igators should make every attempt to conduct efficacy and safet y assessments immediately before administering any rescue treatm ent. An unscheduled visit c an be used for this purpose if necessary . 7.8. Treatment after the End of the Study 7.8.1.

Temporary Interruption from Study Treatment In some circumstances, it may be necessary to temporarily interrupt treatment as a result of AEs or abnorm al laboratory values tha t may have an unclear relationship to invest igational product. For example, invest igational product should be temporarily interrupted if the patient experiences a cardi ovascular adverse event considered to be related to study treatm ent, i s graded as m oderate (Grade 2 according to Commo n Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Version 3.0), and that does not resolve prompt ly with supporti ve care. Except in cases of emergency , it is recommended that the invest igator consult with Lilly (or its design ee) before temporarily interrupting therapy for reasons other than those defined in Table JAHM .4. For the abnormal laboratory findings and clinical events (regard less of relatedness) listed in Table JAHM .4,specific guidance is provided for temporarily interrupting treatment and when treatm ent m ay be restarted.

Unless otherwise sta ted in the subsect ions below, all samples co llected for specified laboratory tests will be destroy ed wi thin 60 days o f recei pt of confi rmed test resul ts. Certain samples may be retained for a longer period, if necessary, to comply wit h applicable laws, re gulations, or laboratory certificati on standards. 9.1. Efficacy Assessments 9.1.1. Primary Efficacy Assessments Validated Investigator’s Global Assessment for Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA -AD): The IGA used in this study, the vIGA -AD (referred to as the IGA throughout the protocol) measures the i nvest igator’s global assessment of the pati ent’s overall severit y of their AD, based on a static, numeric 5 -point scale fro m 0 (clear skin) to 4 (severe disease). The score is based on an overall assessment of the degree of erythema, papul ation/induration, oozing/crusting, and lichenification. 9.1.2. Secondary Efficacy Assessments Eczema Area and Severity Index Scores 9.1.2.1. The EASI assesses extent of disease at 4 body regions and measures 4 clinical signs: (1)erythema, (2) indurat ion/papulat ion, (3) excoriation, and (4) lichenificat ion each on a scale of 0to 3. The EASI confers a maximum score of 72. The EASI evaluates 2 dimensio ns of AD: disease extent and clinical signs (Han ifin et al 2001) . Body surface area affected by AD will be derived from data collected as part of the EASI assessment. SCORing Atopic Dermatitis 9.1.2.2. The SCORing Atopic Dermat itis (SCORAD) index uses the rule o f nines to assess disease extent and evaluates 6 clinical characterist ics to determine disease s everi ty: (1) ery thema, (2)edema/papulat ion, (3) oozing/crusts, (4) excoriation, (5) lichenification, and (6) dryness. The SCORAD index also assesses subject ive symptoms of pruritus and sleep loss. These 3 aspects: extent of di sease, di sease severi ty, and subjective symptoms co mbine to give a maximum possible score of 103 (Stalder et al . 1993; Kunz et al . 1997; Schram et al. 2012) . Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale 9.1.2.3. The Hospi tal Anxiet y Depressi on Scal e (HADS) i s a 14 -item self-assessment scale that determines the levels of anxiet y and depressio n that a patient is experiencing over the past week. The HADS utilizes a 4 -point Li kert scal e (e.g., 0 to 3) for each qu estion and i s intended for ages 12 to 65 years (Zigmo nd and Snait h 1983 ; Whit e et al . 1999 ). Scores for each domain"
50,page_50,"I4V-MC-JAHM(b)Clinical Protocol Page 50 LY3009104(anxiet y and depressio n) can range from 0 to 21, wit h higher scores indicat ing greater anxiet y or depressio n (Zigmond and Snait h 1983; Snait h 2003 ). 9.1.3. Health Outcomes and Quality -of-Life Measures The pati ent self -reported questionnaires will be administered via either an electronic pat ient diary or via an electroni c tablet and in countries where the quest ionnaires have been translated into th e native language of the region and linguist ically validated. Patient -Oriented Eczema Measure 9.1.3.1. The POEM i s a simple, 7 -item, pati ent-administered scale that assesses disease severit y in children and adults. Patients respond to questions about the frequency of 7 symptoms (i tching, sleep disturbance, bleeding, weeping/oozing, cracking, flaking, and dryness/roughness) over the last week. Response categories include “No days,” “1 -2 days,” “3 -4 days,” “5-6 days,” and “Every day” wi th corresponding scores of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Scores range from 0 -28 with higher total scores indicating greater disease severit y (Charman et al . 2004 ). Itch Numeric Rating Scale 9.1.3.2. The Itch Numeric Rat ing Scale (NRS) is a pati ent-administered , 11-point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 representing “no itch” and 10 represent ing “worst itch imaginable.” Overall severit y of a pati ent’s i tching is indicated by select ing the number that best describes the worst l evel of itching in the past 24 hours ( Naegeli et al. 2015 ; Kimball et al. 2016 ). Nocturnal Sleep –Wake and Itch Patterns 9.1.3.3. An act igraphy device, a hypoallergenic device worn on the wrist, will be used to collect sleep – wake patterns and quantify nocturnal scratching events. Each patient will be dispensed 2actigraphy devices. One will be worn on the wrist at all t imes and the other will be worn only during hours of sleep (one on each wrist). Further details on use of the device will be provide d in other instructional materials. Atopic Dermatitis Sleep Scale 9.1.3.4. The Atopi c Dermat itis Sleep Scale (ADSS) is a 3 -item, patient -administered quest ionnaire developed to assess the impact of itch on sleep including difficult y falling asleep, frequency o f waking, and difficult y getting back to sleep last night. Patient’s rate their difficult y falling asleep and difficult y getting back to sl eep, i tems 1 and 3, respectively , using a 5 -point Likert -type scale with response opti ons ranging fro m 0 “not at all” to 4 “very difficult. ” Patients report their frequency of waking l ast ni ght, i tem 2, by selecting the number of times they woke up each night, ranging fro m 0 to 29 times . The ADSS is designed to be completed each day with respondents thinking about sleep “l ast ni ght.” Each i tem is scored individually . Skin Pain Numeric Rating Scale 9.1.3.5. Skin pain NRS is a patient -administered, 11 -point horizontal scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 represent ing “no pain” and 10 represent ing “worst pain imaginable.” Overall sev erity of a patient’s skin pain is indicated by select ing the number that best describes the worst level o f skin pain in the past 24 hours."
51,page_51,"I4V-MC-JAHM(b)Clinical Protocol Page 51 LY3009104Patient Global Impression of Severity 9.1.3.6. The Pati ent Gl obal Impressi on of Severi ty–Atopic Derm atitis (PGI -S-AD) is a sin gle-item question asking the patient how they woul d rate thei r overall AD symptoms over the past 24hours. The 5 categories o f responses range from “no symptoms” to “severe.” Dermatology Life Quality Index 9.1.3.7. The Dermatology Life Qualit y Index (DLQI) is a simple, patient -administered, 10 -item, validated, qualit y-of-life quest ionnaire that covers 6 domains including symptoms and feelings, daily act ivities, leisure, work and school, personal relat ionships, and treatment. The recall period of this scale is ov er the “last week.” Response categories include “not at all,” “a lot,” and “very much,” with corresponding scores of 1, 2, and 3, respect ively, and unanswered (“not relevant”) responses scored as 0. Scores range fro m 0-30 wi th higher scores indicat ing gr eater impairment of qualit y of life. A DLQI total score of 0 to 1 is considered as having no effect on a patient’s healt h-related QoL (Hongbo et al. 2005 ), and a 4 -point change from baseline is considered as the minimal clinically important di fference thresho ld (Khilji et al. 2002 ; Basra et al. 2015 ). European Quality of Life –5Dimensions –5Levels 9.1.3.8. The European Qualit y of Life –5 Dimensi ons–5 Levels (EQ -5D-5L) is a standardized measure of healt h status that provides a simp le, generic measure of healt h for clinical and economic apprai sal. The EQ -5D-5L consists of 2 components: a descript ive system o f the respondent’s healt h and a rating of his or her current health state using a 0 to 100 mm VAS. The descript ive system com prises the foll owing 5 dimensi ons: m obility, self -care, usual activities, pain/disco mfort, and anxiet y/depressi on. Each dimensi on has 5 levels: no problems, slight probl ems, m oderate probl ems, severe probl ems, and extreme problems. The respondent is as ked to indicate his or her healt h state by ticking (or pl acing a cross) in the box associated with the most appropri ate statement in each of the 5 dimensio ns. It should be noted that the numerals 1 to 5 have no ari thmetic properties and should not be used as an ordinal score. The VAS records the respondent’s self -rated heal th on a vert ical VAS where the endpo ints are labeled “best imaginable healt h state” and “worst imaginable health state.” This informat ion can be used as a quant itative measure of healt h outcome. The EQ -5D-5L healt h states, defined by the EQ -5D-5L descri ptive system, may be converted into a single summary index by applying a formula that essent ially attaches values (also called weights) to each of the levels in each dimensio n (Herdman e t al. 2011; EuroQol Group 2015 [WWW]). Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Question naire–Atopic 9.1.3.9. Dermatitis The Work Productivit y and Act ivity Impairment Questi onnai re–Atopic Dermat itis (WPAI -AD) records impairment due to AD during the past 7 days. T he WPAI -AD consists of 6 items grouped into 4 domains: absenteeism (work time missed), presenteeism (impai rment at work/reduced on -the-job effect iveness), work productivit y loss (overall work impairment/absenteeism plus presenteeism), and activit y impairm ent. Scores are calculated as impairment percentages (Reilly et al. 1993 ), with higher scores indicat ing greater impairment and less productivit y."

Appropriateness of Assessments All assessments utilized in this study are standard, wi dely us ed, and generally recognized as reliable, accurate, and relevant except ADSS and Skin Pain NRS which are currently being developed and validated according to regulatory guidances. 9.2. Adverse Events Invest igators are responsible for monitoring the safety of pa tients who have entered this study and for al erting Lilly or its designee to any event that seems unusual, even if this event may be considered an unant icipated benefit to the patient. The invest igator is responsible for the appropriate medical care of pat ients during the study . Invest igators must document their review of each laboratory safety report. The invest igator remains responsible for fo llowing, through an appropriate healt h care option, AEs that are serious or otherwise medically important, conside red rel ated to the invest igational product or the study , or that caused the patient to discontinue the invest igational product before completing the study. The patient should be fo llowed unt il the event resolves, stabilizes with appropriate diagnostic eva luation, or is reasonably explained. The frequency of follow-up evaluat ions of the AE is left to the discret ion of the invest igator. Lack of drug effect is not an AE in clinical studies, because the purpose of the clinical study is to establish treatment effect. After the ICF is signed, study site personnel will record via eCRF the occurrence and nature of each patient’s preexist ing condit ions, including clinically significant signs and symptoms of the disease under treatment in the study . In addi tion, si te personnel will record any change in the condi tion(s) and any new condi tions as AEs. Investi gators shoul d record thei r assessment of the potenti al relatedness of each AE to invest igational product, vi a eCRF. The invest igator will interpret and document whether or not an AE has a reasonable possibilit y of being related to study treatm ent, study device, or a study procedure, taki ng into account the disease, concomitant treatment, or pathologies. A “reasonable possibilit y” means that there is a cause -and-effect relationship between the invest igational product , study device, and/or study procedure and the AE. The invest igator answers yes/no when making this assessment. Planned surgeries and nonsurgical intervent ions should not be reported as AEs unless the underlying medical condit ion has worsened during the course of the study . If a patient’s investigational product is discontinued as a result of an AE, study site personnel must report this to Lilly or its designee via eCRF, clarifying if possible the circu mstances leading to any dosage m odificat ions, or discont inuat ions of treatment."

Examples of such m edical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an em ergency room or at hom e, blood dy scrasias or convulsio ns that do not resul t in inpat ient hospi talizat ion, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. All AEs occurring after signing the ICF are recorded in the eCRF and assessed for serious criteria. The SAE reporting to the sponsor begins after the patient has signed the ICF and has received invest igational product. However, if an SAE occurs after signing the ICF, but prior to receiving invest igational product, the SAE should be reported to the sponsor as per SAE reporting requirements and t imelines if it is considered reasonably possibly related to study procedure. Study site personnel must al ert Lilly or i ts desi gnee of any SAE within 24 hours of invest igator awareness o f the event via a sponsor -approved method. If alerts are issued via telephone, they are to be immediately fo llowed wi th official notificati on on study -specific SAE forms. This 24-hour notificat ion requi rement refers to the init ial SAE information and all fo llow-up SAE inform ation. Patients with a serious hepat ic AE should have add itional data collected using the hepat ic safet y eCRF. Pregnancy (during maternal or paternal exposure to invest igational product) does not meet the definit ion of an AE. However, to fulfill regulatory requirements, any pregnancy should be reported fo llowing the SAE process to collect data on the outcome for both mother and fetus. Invest igators are not obligated to actively seek AEs or SAEs in subjects once they have discontinued and/or completed the study (the pati ent summary CRF has been completed). Howev er, if the invest igator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been discharged from the study , and he or she considers the event reasonably possibly related to the study treatm ent or study parti cipati on, the investi gator m ustpromptly notify Lilly. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions 9.2.1.1. Suspected unexpected serious adverse react ions (SUSARs) are serious events that are not listed in the IB and that the investigator ident ifies as related to investigational product or pr ocedure.

Lilly has procedures that wi ll be fo llowed for the recording and expedited reporting of SUSARs that are consistent with glo bal regulat ions and the associated detailed guidances. 9.2.2. Adverse Events of Special Interest Adverse events of special interest will include the fo llowing: infect ions (including TB, herpes zoster, or opportunist ic infections) malignancies Hepati c events (see Section 9.4.9 ) major adverse cardiovascular events (M ACE) (see Section 9.4.10 ) thrombotic events (such as deep vein thrombosis [DVT] and pulmo nary embo lism). Sites will provide details on these AEs as instructed on the eCRF and may be asked for additional descripti on by Lilly . 9.2.3. Complaint Handling Lilly co llects product complaints on invest igational products and drug delivery systems used in clinical studies to ensure the safet y of study participants, mon itor qualit y, and to facilitate process and product improvements. Patients will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if he or she has a complaint or probl em wi th the invest igational product so that the situation can be assessed. 9.3. Treatment of Overdose Refer to the IB. 9.4. Safety Any clinically significant findings from ECG testing, physical examinat ion, vital signs measurements, or laboratory measurements that result in a diagnosis and that occur after the patient receives the first dose of study treatm ent shoul d be reported to Lilly or its designee as an AE via eCRF. 9.4.1. Electrocardiograms A single 12 -lead standard ECG will be obtained lo cally at Visit 1 and read by a qualified physician (the invest igator or qualified designee) at the site t o determine whether the patient meets entry criteria. Electrocardiograms may be obtained at addit ional times, when deemed clinically necessary ."
55,page_55,"I4V-MC-JAHM(b)Clinical Protocol Page 55 LY30091049.4.2. Vital Signs For each patient, vital signs should be measured according to the Schedule o f Activities (Secti on2). 9.4.3. Physical Exam For each patient, a complete physical examinat ion (excluding pelvic and rectal examinat ions) will be performed at Visit 1 (Screen ing). A symptom -directed physical examinat ion will be perform ed at other visits as specified in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). A com plete physical examinat ion may be repeated at the investigator’s discretion at any time a patient presents with physical co mplaints. 9.4.4. Laboratory Tests For each patient, laboratory tests detailed in Appendix 2 shoul d be conducted accordi ng to the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2). Wi th the excepti on of laboratory test resul ts that m ay unblind the study , Lilly or i ts desi gnee will provide the investi gator wi th the resul ts of laboratory tests analyzed by a central ven dor, if a central vendor is used for the clinical trial. 9.4.5. Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale The C -SSRS captures the occurrence, severit y, and f requency of suicidal ideat ion and/or behavior during the assessment period. The scale includes suggested que stions to solicit the ty pe of inform ation needed to determine if suicidal ideation and/or behavior occurred. The C -SSRS i s administered by an appropri ately trained health care professio nal with at least 1 year of pat ient care/clinical experience. The too l was developed by the National Inst itute of Mental Healt h trial group for the purpose of being a counterpart to the Columbia Classificat ion Algori thm of Suicide Assessment categori zation of suicidal events. For this study, the scale has been adapted (wit h permission fro m the scale authors) to include only the porti on of the scale that captures the occurrence of the 11 preferred ideat ion and behavior categories. The nonleading AE collect ion shoul d occur pri or to the collect ion of the C -SSRS. If a suicide-related event is discovered during the C -SSRS but was not captured during the nonleading AE collect ion, sites shoul d not change the AE form. If an event is serious or leads to discontinuat ion, thi s is an except ion where the SAE and/or AE leading to discon tinuation should be included on the AE form and the process for reporting SAEs should be fo llowed. 9.4.6. Self-Harm and Follow -up Supplement Forms Suicide-related events (behavior and/or ideat ions) will be assessed and evaluated at every visit with the administra tion of the C -SSRS and the Self -Harm Supplement Form. The Self -Harm Suppl ement Form is a single quest ion to enter the number of suicidal behavior events, possible suicide behavi ors, or nonsui cidal self -injuri ous behavi ors. If the number of behavioral eve nts is greater than zero, it will lead to the complet ion of the self -harm fo llow-up form. The self -harm follow-up form is a seri es of quest ions that provides a more detailed descript ion of the behavior cases."

Chest x -ray and Tuberculosis Testing A posteri or–anterior view chest x -ray will be obtained l ocally at screening (Visit 1), unl ess resul ts from a chest x -ray obtained wi thin 6 months prior to the study are available. The chest x-ray will be reviewed by the invest igator or his or her designee to exclu de pat ients with active TB infect ion. In addi tion, pati ents will be tested at screening (Visit 1) for evidence o f active or latent TB as described in the exclusio n criteria, Secti on6.2. Invest igators should fo llow local guidelines for m onitoring pat ients for TB if a pat ient is at hi gh risk for acqui ring TB or reactivat ion of latent TB. 9.4.8. Hepatitis B Virus DNA Monitoring Patients who are HBcAb posit ive and HBV DNA negat ive (undetectable) at Visit 1 will require measurement of HBV DNA at Week 16 (Visit 8) or early terminat ionvisit, regardless of their hepat itisB surface antibody (HBsAb) status. The fo llowing acti ons shoul d be taken in response to HBV DNA test results: If a single result is obtained with a value “below limit of quant itation,” the test shoul d be repeated wi thin approximately 2 weeks. If the repeat test result is “target not detected,” monitoring will resume for those patients enro lling in the long-term extensio n study , JAHN. If the patient has 2 or more test results with a value “below limit of quantitation” or a test result above the limit of quant itation, the pati ent will be permanently discontinued fro m invest igational product (see Section 8.1.2 ) and should be referred to a hepatology specialist. 9.4.9. Hepatic Safety Monitoring and Data Collection If a study patient experiences elevated ALT ≥3x ULN, A LP ≥2x ULN, or elevated TBL ≥2xULN, liver testing ( Appendix 4 ) shoul d be repeated wi thin 3 to 5 days including ALT, AST, ALP, TBL, direct bilirubin, gamma -glutamyl transferase, and creat ine kinase to confirm the abnorm ality and to determine if it is increasing or decreasing. If the abnormalit y persists or worsens, clinical and laboratory monitoring shoul d be initiated by the invest igator and in consultation wit h the study medical mo nitor. Moni toring of ALT, AST, TBL, and ALP should continue until levels normalize or return to approximate baseline levels. Discontinuati on cri teria of investigational products , either tem porary interruption or permanent discontinuat ion, due to abnormal ALT, AST, TBL, or ALP, are detailed in Sect ion8.1. Addit ional safet y data should be co llected via the hepat ic eCRF if 1 or more of the fo llowing condi tions occur: elevation of serum ALT to ≥5x ULN on 2 or more consecut ive blood tests elevated serum TBL to ≥ 2x ULN (except for cases of known Gilbert’s syndro me) elevation of serum ALP to ≥2x ULN on 2 or more consecut ive blood tests"

Safety Monitoring Lilly will periodically review evolving aggregate safet y data wi thin the study by appropri ate methods. In the event that safet y monitoring uncovers an issue that needs to be addressed by unblinding at the group l evel, only members o f the DMC (an advisory group for this study formed to protect the integrit y of data [refer to Interim Analyses sectio n, Secti on10.3.7 ]) can conduct addit ional analyses o f the safet y data. The Lilly clinical research physician will mo nitor safety data throughout the course of the study . Lilly will review SAEs wit hin time frames mandated by co mpany procedures. The Lilly clinical research ph ysician will, as is appropriate, consult with the funct ionally independent Gl obal Patient Safet y therapeutic area physician or clinical scient ist and peri odically review trends in safet y data and l aboratory analy tes. Any concerning trends in frequency or severit y noted by an investigator and/or Lilly (or designee) may require further evaluat ion. All deaths and SAE reports will be reviewed in a blinded manner by Lilly during the clinical trial. These reports will be reviewed to ensure completeness and accu racy but will not be unblinded to Lilly during the clinical trial. If a death or a clinical AE is deemed serious, unexpected, and possibly related to invest igational product, only Lilly Gl obal Patient Safety will be unblinded for regulatory reporting and safet y monitoring purposes. These measures will preserve the integrit y of the data collected during this trial and minimize any potential for bias while providing for appropriate safet y monitoring. Invest igators will mo nitor vital signs and carefully review findings that may be associated with cardi ovascular and venous thrombotic events. Adverse event reports and vital signs will be collected at each study visit. The cardi ovascular moni toring plan includes the following: regularmonitoring of lipid levels potenti al MA CE (cardi ovascular death, MI, stroke), other cardiovascular events (such as hospitalizat ion for unstable angina, hospitalizat ion for heart failure, serious arrhy thmia, resuscitated sudden death, cardiogenic shock, co ronary revascularization such as coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous coronary intervent ion), venous thrombotic events and noncardiovascular deaths will be ident ified by the investigative site or through medical review and will be sent to a blinded Clinical Event Committee for adjudicat ion at regul ar intervals."

Pharmacokinetics A venous blood sample will be drawn at the times indicated in the Schedule of Act ivities (Secti on2) (Weeks 0 [first dose, 2 samples], 4, 8, 12, and 16). These blood samples will be used to determine the plasma concentrations of baricit inib using a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Bl oodsamples that will be used for other laboratory assessments (chemistry , hematol ogy, etc.) shoul d be drawn at approximately the same t ime as the sam ples drawn to determine plasma concentratio ns of baricit inib. The timing will be as follows: At Visit 2 (Wee k0), baseline laboratory samples should be taken before administration of invest igational product . Patients will take their investigational product in the clinic, and PK samples will be drawn 15 minutes and 1 hour postdose. At Visit 5 (Week 4), pati ents will be asked to take their investigational product at home prior to visit ing the clinic. The clinic visit should be scheduled so that the blood sam ple collected during this visit is drawn 2 to 4 hours after the dose is taken at home. For Vi sit6 (Week 8)and Visit 7 (Week 12) pati ents will be asked to not take their investigat ional product before visit ing the clinic, and a blood sample will be collected at any time predose on the day of the clinic visits. If the patient has taken the oral dose prior to t he visit, the sample may be drawn anyt ime postdose, and the inabilit y to collect a predose sample will not be considered a protocol violation. At Visit 8 (Week 16), pati ents will be asked to take thei r invest igational product at hom e prior to visi ting the clinic. The clinic visit shoul d be scheduled so that the blood sample co llected during this visit is drawn 4 to 6 hours after the oral dose i s taken at hom e. For the ETV, a sample may be drawn any time if the l ast dose of invest igational drug was taken wit hin the last 48 hours. For vi sits where PK samples will be co llected, the actual date and 24 -hour clock time of sample collect ion, and the date and time of the last 2 doses prior to the sample being drawn, should be recorded. At Visit 5 (Week 4) and Visit 8 (Week 16), these 2 doses should be the dose given the morning o f the day of sample collect ion and the dose given the previous day. At Visit 6 (Week 8) and Visit 7 (Week 12), the 2 previous doses should be the dose taken y esterday and the dose taken the day before that. This sampling schedule should be fo llowed as closely as possible; however, failure to take PK samples at these specified times will not be considered a protocol vio lation. If the patient fails to follow the di rections f or a parti cular vi sit, the sampl e shoul d still be co llected at that visit, and the date and 24 -hour clock time o f sample collect ion and the date and time of the 2 doses prior to the sam ple being drawn should be recorded."

Pharm acokinet ic samples will be kept in storage at a laboratory facilit y designated by the sponsor. Pharm acokinet ic samples may also be assayed for addit ional exploratory analyses. Pharmacokinet ic results will not be provided to investigative sites unt il the completion of the study or to the blinded study team until the study has been unblinded. Bioanaly tical samples collected to m easure invest igational product concentration will b e retained for a maximum of 1 year following last patient visit for the study. 9.6.

There i s growing evidence that genetic variat ion may impact a pati ent’s response to therapy . Variable response to therapy may be due to genetic determinants t hat impact drug absorption, distribut ion, metabo lism, and excretion, the mechanism of act ion of the drug, the disease etiology, and/or the m olecular subt ype of the di sease being treated. In the event of an unexpected AE, the samples may be genoty ped and a nalysis may be performed to evaluate a genet ic associat ion with response to baricit inib. These invest igations may be limited to targeted exome sequencing approach of known targets involved in drug metabo lism or, if appropriate, geno me-wide associ ation stu dies may be performed to ident ify regio ns of the geno me associated with the variabilit y observed in drug response. Samples will only be used for investigations related to di sease and drug or class of drugs under study in the context of this clinical progr am. Samples will not be used to conduct unspecified disease or populat ion genet ic research either now or in the future. Samples will be used to investigate variable response to baricit inib and to investigate genet ic variants though t to pl ay a rol e in AD o r other inflammatory skin diseases. Assessment of variable response may include evaluati on of AEs or differences in efficacy. All samples will be coded with the patient number. These samples and any data generated can be linked back to the patient only b y the invest igator site personnel. Samples will be retained for a m aximum of 15years after the last patient visit for the study, or for a shorter peri od if local regulations and/or (ethical review boards (ERBs)/invest igational review boards) impose shorte r time limits, at a facilit y selected by Lilly.

Regardless of techno logy utilized, genoty ping data generated will be used only for the specific research scope described in this sect ion. 9.8. Biomarkers Biomarker research is performed to address questions of rel evance to drug di sposi tion, target engagement, pharmacodynamics (PD), mechanism of act ion, variabilit y of pat ient response (including safet y), and clinical outcome. Sample collect ion is incorporated into clinical studies to enable examinat ion of these que stions through measurement of bio molecules including DNA, RNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular elements. Bloodsamples for nonpharmacogenetic bio marker research will be co llected at the times specified in the Schedule of Act ivities (Section 2)where local regulat ions allow. Samples will be used for research on the drug target, disease process, variable response to baricit inib, pathways associate d with AD, m echanism of action of baricit inib, and/or research method or i n validat ing diagnost ic tools or assay(s) related to AD. All samples will be coded with the patient number. These samples and any data generated can be linked back to the patient on ly by the invest igator site personnel. Samples will be retained for a m aximum of 15years after the last patient visit for the study , or for a shorter peri od if local regulations and ERBs impose shorter time limit s, at a facilit y selected by Lilly .

The proposed sample size will ensure a >90% power to detect an abso lute difference of 20% between the baricit inib 4 -mg and placebo treatment groups and the baricit inib 2 -mg and placebo treat ment group s, each using a 2 -sided alpha of 0.025 , assuming a 10% placebo response rate for the primary endpoint . The assumpt ions are based on what was observed in the Phase 2 study (JAH G). The proposed end point of IGA 0 or 1 represents patients whose A D is cl ear or alm ost clear from a baseline of moderate or severe disease. The ant icipated effect size represents 3times m ore pati ents achieving this benefit compared to placebo which, in discussio n with therapeuti c experts, i s of a magnitude that is cons idered clinically relevant. Sample size and power estimates were obtained from nQuery ®Advisor 7.0. 10.2. Populations for Analyses Unless otherwise specified, the efficacy and healt h outcom e analyses will be conducted on the intent-to-treat populat ion, defined a s all randomized pati ents, even if the patient does not receive the correct treatment, or otherwise did not fo llow the protocol. Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment to which they were assigned. Significant protocol vio lations will be described in the SAP. Safety analyses will be done on all rando mized patients who receive at least 1 dose of investigat ional product and who did not discontinue fro m the study for the reason “Lost to Follow-up” at the first postbaseline visit. Further details of other popul ations will be described in the SAP. Patients will be analyzed according to the dosing regimen to which they were assigned in the Treatment Period. 10.3. Statistical Analyses 10.3.1. General Statistical Considerations Statistical analysis o f this study will be the responsibilit y of Lilly o r its desi gnee. A detailed SAP describing the statist ical methodol ogies will be developed by Lilly or i ts desi gnee. Any change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol will require an amendment ONLY if it changes a principal feature of the protocol. Any other change to the data analysis methods described in the protocol, and the just ification for making the change, will be described in the clinical study report (CSR) . Additional exploratory analyses of th e data will be conducted as deemed appropriate. All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2 -sided al pha level of 0.05, unless otherwise stated. Treatment comparisons of discrete efficacy variables between baricit inib and placebo will be made u sing a l ogistic regressio n analysis wit h regi on, di sease severi ty, and treatm ent group in the model. The percentages, difference in percentages, and 95% confidence interval"
62,page_62,"I4V-MC-JAHM(b)Clinical Protocol Page 62 LY3009104(CI) of the difference in percentages will be reported. Treatment -by-region interaction will be added to the logist ic regressio n model of the primary and key secondary variables as a sensit ivity analysis. If this interaction is significant at a 2 -sided 0.1 l evel, further inspect ion will be used to assess whether the interaction is qua ntitative (i.e., the treatment effect is consistent in direct ion but not size o f effect) or qualitat ive (the treatment is beneficial for some but not all regions). The p-value fro m the Fisher exact test will also be produced. When evaluat ing cont inuous me asures over time, a restricted maximum likelihood -based mixed -effects m odel of repeated m easures (MMRM) will be used. The model will include treatm ent, regi on, baseline severi ty, visi t, and treatment -by-visit interact ion as fixed categorical effects and b aseline score and baseline score -by-visit interacti on as fixed continuous effects. An unstructured (co)variance structure will be used to model the between -and within -patient errors. If this analysis fails to converge, other structures will be tested. The Kenward –Roger m ethod will be used to estimate the degrees of freedo m. Type III sums of squares for the least squares means (LSMs) will be used for the statist ical com parison; 95% CI will also be reported. Contrasts will be set up within the model to test treatment groups at specific time po ints of interest. Further details on the use of MMRM will be described in the SAP. Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy and healt h outcome variables may also be made using analysis o f covariance (ANCOVA) with region, di sease severi ty, treatm ent group, and baseline value in the model. Ty peIII tests for LSM will be used for statistical co mpar ison between treatment groups. The LSM difference, standard error, p -value, and 95% CI may also be reported. The m ethod used to handle missing data will be specified in the SAP. Fisher exact test will be used for the AEs, discont inuat ion, and other categorical safet y data for between -treatm ent group com parisons. Continuous vital signs, body weight, and other continuo us safet y variables including laboratory variables will be analyzed by an ANCOVA with treatm ent and baseline value in the model. Shift tables for categorical safet y analyses (e.g., “high” or “low” laboratory resul ts) will also be produced. Missing data imputation: 1.Nonresponder imputation (NRI): All patients who discont inue the study or the study treatm ent at any time for any reason will be defined as nonresponders for the NRI analysis for categorical variables such as IGA 0/1 or EASI 50/75/90 after discontinuat ion and onward. Patients who receive rescue therapy will be analyzed as nonresponders after rescue and onward. An addit ional analysis will be performed that includes all available data whether rescue medicat ion was given or not. 2.Continuous variab les such as EASI and SCORAD scores will be assumed to be missing after rescue or discont inuat ion and then an MMRM analysis will be performed. An additional analysis will be performed that includes all available data whether rescue medicat ion was given or not. 3.Last observed carried forward (LOCF) : An addit ional analysis will be performed that uses the last observed value on or prior to discont inuat ion or rescue therapy .

Addit ional sensit ivity analyses for the primary and key secondary endpoints such as tipping po int analyses as well as a reference based mult iple imputation method may be done and will be specified in the SAP. Adjustment for Multiple Comparisons: Multiplicity controlled analyses will be performed on the primary and maj or secondary endpoints to con trol the overall family -wise Ty peI error rate at a 2 -sided α level o f 0.05. The graphical multiple testi ng procedur e described in Bretz et al. (2011) will be used. The graphical approach is a closed testing procedure, hence it strongly control s the family -wise error rate across all endpo ints (Alosh et al. 2014). Details of the specific graphical testing scheme (inclu ding testing order, interrelat ionships, Ty peI error allocat ion, and the associated propagation) will be prespecified in the SAP. The fo llowing i s a list of primary and key secondary endpoints to be tested: Primary: proporti on of baricitinib 4 -mg pat ients achieving IGA of 0 or 1 and ≥2-point improvement from baseline at Week 16. proporti on of baricitinib2 mg patients achieving IGA of 0 or 1 and ≥2 poi nt improvement from baseline at Week 16 .

Safety Analyses All safet y data will be descript ively summarized by treatment groups and analyzed using the safet y popul ation. Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that first occurred or worsened in severi ty after the first dose of study treatm ent. The number of TEAEs as well as the number and percentage of patients who experienced at least 1 TEAE will be summarized using MedDRA (Medi cal Dict ionary for Regulatory Activities) for each system organ class (or a body system) and each pr eferred term by treatm ent group.

Fisher exact test will be used to perform co mpar isons between each baricit inib dose and th e placebo group. All clinical laboratory resul ts will be descri ptively summarized by treatment group. Individual resul ts that are outsi de of norm al reference ranges will be flagged in data list ings. Quant itative clinical hematology , chemistry , and urinal ysis variables obtained at the baseline to postbaseline visits will be summarized as changes fro m baseline by treatm ent group and analyzed using ANCOVA with treatment and baseline value in the model. Categorical variables, including the incidence of abnor mal values and incidence of adverse events of special interest, will be summarized by frequency and percentage of patients in corresponding categories. Shift tables will be presented for selected measures. Observed values and changes fro m baseline (predos e or screening if missing) for vital signs and physical characteristics will be descript ively summari zed by treatm ent group and time point. Change from baseline to postbaseline in vital signs, and body weight will be analyzed using ANCOVA with treatment a nd baseline value in the model. The incidence and average duration o f investigational product interruptions will be summarized and co mpared descriptively amo ng treatment groups. Various techniques may be used to estimate the effects of invest igational pro duct i nterrupti ons on safet y measures. Further analyses may be performed and will be planned in the SAP. Data collected after init iation of rescue therapy will be summarized as appropri ate. 10.3.5. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analyses All plasma baricit inib c oncentrati on–time data will be pooled and evaluated using populat ion PK methods. A covariate screen of patient and study -specific factors will be included in the analyses based on factors invest igated in previous and (if any) ongoing PK analyses, and on t heir relevance to the target populat ion. Expl oratory and/or m odel-based analyses examining the relationships between baricit inib exposure and efficacy and response endpo ints will be conducted. Other analyses of efficacy and safet y outcom e measures m ay al so be assessed as scientifically appropriate and warranted by available data. Details about the analyses to be conducted will be contained in the PK/PD analysis plan. 10.3.6. Other Analyses Health Outcome Measures 10.3.6.1. The health outcome measures will be analyzed usin g methods described for continuous or categori cal data as described for efficacy measures in Sect ion10.3.3 . Subgroup Analyses 10.3.6.2. To assess whether the treatment effect is similar across subgroups for the primary efficacy outcom e, a l ogistic model will be used and will include treatment, stratificat ion vari ables, the subgroup variable (e.g., sex) and the subgroup by treatment interac tion. If the interacti on is statist ically significant at =0.10, the nature of the interact ion will be explored, that is, within"

Similarly, for the continuous variables of EASI, the MMRM model will in clude addi tional vari ables for subgroup and the subgroup by treatm ent interacti on. Subgroups to be evaluated will include regi on, baseline severi ty, sex, age, race, pri or therapy , etc. Further definit ions for the levels of the subgroup variables, the anal ysis methodol ogy, and any additional subgroup analyses will be defined in the SAP. Because this study is not powered for subgroup analyses, all subgroup analyses will be treated as exploratory. 10.3.7. Interim Analyses Data Monitoring Committee 10.3.7.1. A DMC will oversee the conduct of this trial. The DMC will consist of members external to Lilly. This DMC will fo llow the rul es defined in the DMC charter, focusing on potential and ident ified risks for this mo lecule and for this class of compounds. Data Monitoring Commi ttee membership will include, at a minimum, specialist s with expertise in dermatology , stati stics, and other appropri ate speci alties. The DMC will be authorized to review unblinded results of analyses by treatmen t group pri or to database lock, including st udy discont inuat ion data, AEs including SAEs, clinical laboratory data, vi tal sign data, etc. The DMC may recommend continuation of the study , as designed; temporary suspensi on of enro llment; or the discontinuat ion of a particular dose regimen or the entire study . While the DMC may request to revi ew efficacy data to investi gate the benefi t/risk relationship in the context of safet y observations for ongoing patients in the study , no inform ation regarding efficacy will be communicated . Moreover, the study will not be stopped for posi tive efficacy resul ts nor will it be stopped for fut ility. Hence, no alpha is spent . Details of the DMC, including its operating characterist ics, will be docum ented in a DMC charter and DMC analysis plan. Besides DMC members, a limited number of pre -ident ified individuals may gain access to the limited unblinded data, as specified in the unblinding plan, prior to the interim or final database lock to ini tiate the final populat ion PK/PD model development processes or for prepara tion of regul atory docum ents. Inform ation that may unblind the study during the analyses will not be reported to study sites or blinded study team until the study has been unblinded. Unblinding details will be specified in a separate unblinding plan docum ent. Adjudication Committee 10.3.7.2. A blinded Clinical Event Committee will adjudicate potential MACE (cardiovascular death, MI, stroke), other cardiovascular events (such as hospitalizat ion for unstable angina, hospitalizat ion for heart failure, serious arrhy thmia, resuscitated sudden death, cardiogenic shock, coronary revascularization such as coronary artery bypass graft or percutaneous coronary interventi on), venous thrombotic events, and noncardiovascular deaths. Details o f membership, operations, recommendat ions from the Committee, and the communicat ion plan will be docum ented in the Charter."

Temporary Interruption from Study Treatment In some circumstances, it may be necessary to temporarily interrupt treatment as a result of AEs or abnorm al laboratory values that m ay have an unclear relationship to invest igational product. For example, invest igational product should be temporarily int errupted if the patient experiences a cardi ovascular adverse event considered to be related to study treatm ent, i s graded as m oderate (Grade 2 according to Commo n Termino logy Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Version 3.0), and that does not resolve promp tly with supporti ve care. Except in cases of emergency , it is recommended that the invest igator consult with Lilly (or its designee) before temporarily interrupting therapy for reasons other than those defined in Table JAHM.4. For the abnormal laboratory findings and clinical events (regardless of relatedness) listed in Table JAHM.4, specific guidance is provided for temporarily interrupting treatment and when treatment may be restarted. Retest frequency and timing of fo llowup laboratory tests to m onitor the abnorm al finding is at the discret ion of the investigator.

These blood samples will be used to determine the plasma concentrations of baricit inib using a validated liquid chromatograp hy tandem mass spectrometry method. Bl ood sam ples that will be used for other laboratory assessments (chemistry , hematol ogy, etc.) shoul d be drawn at approximately the same t ime as the sam ples drawn to determine plasma concentratio ns of baricit inib. The timing will be as follows: At Visit 2 (Week 0), baseline laboratory samples should be taken before administration of invest igational product. P patients will take their investigational product in the clinic, and PK samples will be drawn 15 minutes and 1 hour postdose. 10.1. Sample Size Determination Study JAHM will aim to enroll approximately 600 patients ≥18years of age. The proposed sample size will ensure a >90% power to detect an abso lute difference of 20% between the baricit inib 4 -mg and placebo treatm ent groups and the baricit inib 2- mg and placebo treatment group, each using a 2 -sided alpha of 0.025 , assuming a 10% placebo response rate for the primary endpoint using a 2 sided al pha of 0.05 . 10.2.

General Statistical Considerations … All tests of treatment effects will be conducted at a 2 s ided al pha level of 0.05, unl ess otherwise stated. Treatment comparisons of discrete efficacy variables between baricit inib and placebo will be made using a logist ic regressio n analysis wit h regi on, di sease severi ty, and treatm ent group in the model. The percentages, difference in percentages, and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference in percentages will be reported. Treatment by region interacti on will be added to the logist ic regressio n model of the primary and key secondary variables as a sen sitivity analysis. If this interaction is significant at a 2 sided 0.1 level, further inspect ion will be used to assess whether the interaction is quant itative (i.e., the treatment effect is consistent in direct ion but not size o f effect) or qualitat ive (the treatm ent is beneficial for some but not all regions). When logist ic regressio n sample size requirements are not met (<5 responders in any category for any factor), Tthe p-value from the Fisher exact test will also be isproduced instead of the odds ra tio and CI . Adjustment for Multiple Comparisons: … The fo llowing i s a list of primary and key secondary endpoints to be tested: Primary: proporti on of baricitinib 4 -mg pat ients achieving IGA of 0 or 1 and ≥2-point improvement from baseline at Week 16. proporti on of baricitinib 2 -mg pat ients achieving IGA of 0 or 1 and ≥2-point improvement from baseline at Week 16. Key Secondaries: proporti on of baricitinib2-mg or 1-mg pat ients achieving IGA of 0 or 1 with a ≥2-point improvement at Week 16. 10.3.4. Safety A nalyses … Observed values and changes fro m baseline (predose or screening if missing) for vital signs and physical characteristics will be descript ively summari zed by treatm ent group and time point. Change from baseline to postbaseline in vital si gns, C SSRS score, and body weight will be analyzed using ANCOVA with treatment and baseline value in the model. 11.
