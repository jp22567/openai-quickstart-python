14,page_14,"Novartis Confidential Page 15 Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 00) Protocol No. CLOU064A2201 1 Introduction 1.1 Background Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) is defined as the spontaneous occurrence of itchy wheals (hives), angioedema or both lasting for at least 6 weeks (Zuberbier et a l 2018 ). The classic description of urticaria is a wheal and flare with a pale e levated lesion and surrounding erythema, ranging in size from a few millimeters to a few centimeters across, usuall y occurring in groups and often coalescing to form large confluent lesions. CSU can be debilitating and is associated with intense itching and has a major impact on patient’s well-being, suggested to be comparable to that of severe coronary artery disease (Greaves 2003 ). The symptoms of urticaria and urticarial -associated angioedema adversel y a ffect daily activities and sleep (O'Donnell e t al1997 ). The burden of CSU on health -related quality of life (HRQoL) and work productivity is substantial ( Maurer et al 2017 ). Second generation H1- antihistamines are recommended as first line treatment for subjects with CSU but less than 40% of these subjects respond adequatel y (Guillén -Aguinaga e t al2016 ). While uptitration of second generation antihistamines is recommended b y most CSU treatment guidelines as second line therapy (Zuberbier e t al2018 ), the efficacy of uptitrated H1- antihistamines in CSU has not been s tudied in larger clinical studies and hence uptitr ation is considered off-label. Omalizumab is a highly effective third line therapy for CSU subjects. However, less than 50% of subjects treated with Omalizumab reach a complete control of signs and symptoms of CSU (Kaplan e t al2016 ). Therefore, there is a high medical need for new treatment options for CSU subjects. Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase and member of the TEC kinase family . BTK is expressed in selected cells of the adaptive and innate immune system including B cells, macrophag es, mast cells/basophils and thrombocy tes. BTK is indispensable for signaling through the Fc epsilon receptor (FcεR1 for IgE) and the activating Fc gamma receptors (FcγR for IgG), as well as the B cell antigen receptor (BCR )and BTK inhibitors (BTKi) like ibrutinib are approved for the treatment of B cell malignancies (Hendriks e t al2014 ). Recently , it has been demonstrated that inhibition of BTK leads to inhibition of mast cell and basophil activation/d egranulation in vitro and to reduced wheal sizes in skin prick tests with patients suffering from IgE-mediated allergies (Smiljkovic et al2017 ;Regan et al2017 ; Dispenza e t al2018 ). Thus, BTK inhibition is a p romising therapeutic concept for the treatment of chronic urticaria. LOU064 is a lowmolecular weight compound for oral administration that covalently binds and inhibits BTK with high selectivity . It has been shown to effectively inhibit basophil activation in health y volunteers and CSU patients as measured by the inhibition of CD63 up-regulation . Additionally , LOU064 reduced wheal sizes in skin prick tests.

The balanced allocation of subjects toplacebo and6treatment a rms receiving LOU064 at doses from 10 to 100 mg either once or twice dail y aims to establish an accurate dose-response model for the two dosing intervals allowing the selection of the treatment regimen with the best benefit -risk profile for patients in the confirmatory phase of the development program with LOU064 (also see Section 4.3 ). Thescreening period will allow the assessment of eligibility of subjects and the determination of baseline disease activity . The assessment of the primary endpoint will be at Week 4 as LOU064 is expected to have a fast onset of action. A 12-week treatment pe riod was chosen to investigate the maintenance of the expected effect size plateau andto allow historic comparison to other treatment options for CSU, egomalizumab. A 4-weeks follow -up will enable the assessment of sustained treatment response or CSU relapse after withdrawal of LOU064."
19,page_19,"Novartis Confidential Page 20 Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 00) Protocol No. CLOU064A2201 4.2 Rationale for choice of background therapy H1-antihistamines were chosen as background medication as it reflects the current treatment guidelines to add a second -or third -line therapy to H1 -antihistamines in CSU patients who are not adequatel y controlled by H1 -antihistamines ( Zuberbier et al 2018 ). 4.3 Rationale for dose/regimen and duration of treatment In this study , LOU064 will be used in three q.d. arms (10 mg; 35mg; 100mg) and three b.i.d. arms (10 mg; 25 mg; 100 mg) for 85 days (12 weeks). Treatment duration is covered by preclinical data and will allow the assessment of the effect size of LOU064 in CSU, the onset of action, and the earl y maintenance of the effect siz e plateau. The proposed study design is expected to enable proper characterization of dose-and exposure - response relationships for once and twice daily dosing, and thus support determination of the"
20,page_20,"Novartis Confidential Page 21 Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 00) Protocol No. CLOU064A2201 optimal dosing regimen for L OU064 for confirmation into Phase 3. For detailed description of pre-clinical and cl inical study results please refer to the IB. 4.4 Rationale for choice of control drugs (comparator/placebo) or combination drugs Placebo was chosen as comparator to adjust for the known pronounced placebo effect in CSU patients. The use of placebo in this patient population is considered to be appropriate since patients will additionally receive a background therap y with H1-antihistamines (see Section 6.1.2 ). 4.6 Benefits and risks To date, no CSU patients have been treated with LOU064, and no reports about treatment of CSU patients with other BTK i nhibitors have been published. However, chronic urticaria is a mast cell and basophil driven disease (Ferrer et al 2015 )andLOU064 as well as other BTK inhibitors have been shown to effectivel y inhibit mast cell and basophil activation : BTK inhibition interferes with the up-regulation of the activa tion markers CD63 and CD203c (LOU064 IB). LOU064 and ibrutinib, an approved BTK inhibitor used to treat B cell malignancies, have been shown to effectivel y reduce wheal sizes in skin prick tests (Regan e t al 2017 ; Dispenza et al 2018 ; LOU064 IB). SPT inhibition was shown to be a reliable clinical proxy for measuring the effectiveness of a compo und t o treat CSU ( Arm et al 2014 ). BTK inhibition may offer a new therapeutic principle for treating CSU thatdiffers significantly from H1-antihistamines and anti-IgE biologics. BTK inhibition with LOU 064 may therefore offer treatment options for patients with contraindications against or having an inadequate response to approved treatment options for CSU including biologics. These patients with a high unmet medical need will be part of the eligible pat ient population for this study . No serious or severe AE have been associated with the administration of LOU064, the majorit y of observed AEs were singular events and there was no relationship between LOU064 doses and AEs or the number of all observed AEs. Asummary of AEs and of the pre -clinical safet y data can be found in the IB. Based on a thorough review of safet y information currentl y available in the literature together with an assessment of safety data obtained from both clinical and preclinical experience with LOU064, the following safet y topics are considered as potential risks for LOU064 and require close monitoring in the proposed study . Of important note, many safety risks identified for ibrutinib and acalabrutinib, two BTK inhibitors approved for the treatm ent of B cell"
21,page_21,"Novartis Confidential Page 22 Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 00) Protocol No. CLOU064A2201 malignancies, are less likely related to the pharmacology of inhibition of the BTK, but rather to the underl ying indications being treated, for example, tumor lysis syndrome, second primar y malignancies etc. Therefore, when comparing the safe ty risks between the approved BTKi ( eg: ibrutinib and acalabrutinib) and LOU064, the relevance and importance of the study patient populations must be taken into consideration. Infections: BTK is an important signaling node downstream of cell surface receptors and expressed in several immune cells of the adaptive and innate system, including B cells, macrophages and mast cells/basophils. Therefore, L OU064 has the potential to increase the risk of infections. Patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) –a genetic defect associated with a lack of BTK –suffer from recurrent bacterial and enteroviral infections which may be associated with neutropenia ( Kumar et al 2006 ).However, in XLA BTK - deficiency leads to impaired B cell and plasma cell development and in turn to a close to complete absence of immunoglobulins. In adult patients, BTK inhibition primarily interferes with B cell activation but not plasma cell function and is therefore not associated with a marked decrease of immunoglobulins (Hendriks et al 2014; Sun et al 2015 ; Nutt et al 2015). Administration of ibrutinib and a calabrutinib is associated with a risk of infecti on i n patients suffering from B cell malignancies (see Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for ibrutinib and acalabrutinib ). All patients participating in LOU064 clinic al studies will be monitored closely for signs and symptoms of infections while in the study . Patients with a known history of chronic recurrent or active ongoing infections will be excluded from the study (refer to Section 5.2 for details). Impaired platelet function :BTK is a signaling kinase in one of sever al platelet activation pathway s.In the prescribing information for both ibrutinib and acalabrutinib, bleeding /bruising events are very common and affec ting approximately 50% of patient s with hematologic malignancies. Warnings on hemorrhagic events including deaths have also been described (see SmPC for ibrutinib and acalabrutinib). Compared to other drugs in the same class, LOU064 demonstrated a higher selectivity for BTK vs. other TEC kinase s. Thus , bleeding may be less a safety concern when compared to ibrutinib and acalabrutin ib. Patients receiving LOU064 must be closely monitored for any signs and symptoms of bleeding while in the study. Subjects with a known history of bleeding disorder , subjects taking medication that isknown to increase the bleeding risk(other than acetylsalicy lic acid), and subjects with an increased thromboembolic riskmust be excluded from the study (see details in Section 5.2). Myelomodulation : The role of BTK inhibition in myelomodulation is not fully understood . Treatment emergent grade 3 or 4 cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocy topenia and anaemia) were reported in patients with hematologic malignancies treated with ibrutinib and acalabrutinb (see SmPC for ibrutinib and acalabrutinib). Therefore, patients must be closel y monitored for signs and sy mptoms of cy topenia while in the study , and those with a history of hematological disorders or with m arkedl y altered hematolog ic parameters at baseline must be excluded from the study (see details in Section 5.2). Risk of cardiovascular origin : LOU064 is a nin vitro inhibitor of the hERG channel protein, without affecting other ion channels."
22,page_22,"Novartis Confidential Page 23 Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 00) Protocol No. CLOU064A2201 For ibrutinib, atrial fibrillation wasdescribed for 3% to 6% of subjects across multiple trials which might be associated with Na-channel inhibition (see SmPC for ibrutinib) . For acalabrutinib, both atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter of any grade were reported in 3% of patients ( see SmPC for acalabrutinib). Therefore, an intensive ECG monitoring strategy be implemented in this study (see Section 8 .4.2 ). In a ddition, patients with a known history or current diagnosis of ECG abnormali ties i ndicating significant risk of safety will be excluded from the study (see details in Section 5.2). Drug -drug interactions : Concomitant administration with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers may possibly cause substantial changes in LOU064 drug exposure, and must be avoided while in the study. Reproductive toxicity : LOU064 is not genotoxic or mutagenic in in vitro or in vivo studies. For ibruti nib and acalabrutinib, embry ofetal toxicity in animals is reported (see SmPCs). Highl y effective methods of contraception must be practiced. Women of child bearing potential and sexually active males must be informed that taking the study treatment may involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study , and agree that in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirements outlined in the exclusion criteria. If there is any question that the subjec t will not reliably comply , they should not enter or continue in the study . In summary , CSU patients with inadequate response to H1-antihistamines and other available treatment options participating in this clinical trial may benefit from treatment with LOU064 due to its impact on mast cell and basophil activation. Additionally , this study will help improve the scientific understanding of LOU064 in the management of CSU and offer the potential of developing an innovative drug that could potentially improve the qualit y of life for CSU patients beyond the conventional treatment modalities currently available to them. Potential risks are mitigated by compliance with inclusion/exclusion criteria, study proced ures, close clinical monitoring andstudy drug discont inuation rules .As with investigati onal drugs in general, not"

The selection of the H1-antihistamines rescue medication should be made only once for an individual subject and documented in the source document . For each individual subject, the H1-antihistamine rescue medication used must differ from the H1-antihistamine used for background medication . For detailed information on the rescue medication, refer to the corresponding SmPC. A change of the rescue medica tion for an individual subject is not permitted. The usage of rescue therap y will be recorded in the eDiar y(UPDD question 5). Name and dose of rescue medication will be reported in the eCRF .Rescue medication will be sourced locally and provided to the patient during the stud y. 6.3 Subject numbering, treatment assignment, randomization 6.3.1 Subject numbering Each subject is identified in the study by a Subject Number (Subject No.), that is assigned when the subject is first enrolled for screening and is retained as the primary identifier for the subject throughout his/her entire participation in the trial. The Subject No. consists of the Center Number (Cente r No.) (as assigned by Novartis to the investigative site) with a sequential subject number suffixed to it, so that each subject is numbered uniquel y across the entire database. Upon signing the ICF, the subject is assigned to the next sequential Subject No. available. 6.3.2 Treatment assignm ent, randomization At Day 1,all eligible subjects will be randomized via Interactive Response Technology (IRT) to one of the treatment arms. The investigator or his/her delegate will contact the IRT after confirming that the subject fulfills all the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The IRT will assign a"
30,page_30,"Novartis Confidential Page 31 Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 00) Protocol No. CLOU064A2201 randomization number to the subject, which will be used to link the subject to a treatment arm and will specify a unique medication number for the first package of study treatment to be dispensed to the subjec t. The randomization numbers will be generated using the following procedure to ensure that treatment assignment is unbiased and concealed from subjects and investigator staff. A subject randomization list will be produced by the IRT provider using a validated system that automates the random assignment of subject numbers to randomization numbers. These randomization numbers are linked to the different treatment arms, which in turn are linked to medication numbers. A separate medication list will be produc ed by or under the responsibility of Novartis Global Clinical Supply using a validated system that automates the random assignment of medication numbers to packs containing the study treatment. Randomization will be stratified by geographical region and prior usage of anti-IgE biologics (including omalizumab and ligelizumab) for treatment of CSU. The randomization scheme for subjects will be reviewed and approved by a m ember of the Randomization Office. 6.4 Treatment blinding Subjects, investigator staff, persons performing the assessments will remain blind edto the identity of the treatment from the time of randomization until final database lock . Designated Novartis study team members will remain blinded until the primary endpoint analysis (Week 4 anal ysis). Blinding will be maintained using the following methods: (1) Randomization data are kept strictly confidential until the time of unblinding, and will not be accessible by anyone else involved in the study except in the case of subject emergencies (see Section 6 .6.2)(2) the identity of the treatments will be concealed by the use of study treatment t hat are all identical in packaging, labeling, schedule of administration, appearance, taste and odor. The randomization codes associated with subjects from whom PK sa mples are taken will be disclosed to unblinded PK anal ysts who will keep PK results confidential until data base lock. Unblinding will occur in the case of subject emergencies and at the conclusion of the study . 6.5 Dose escalation and dose modification Invest igational or other study treatment dose adjustments and/or interruptions are not permitted. 6.6 Additional treatment guidance 6.6.1 Treatment compliance The investigator must promote compliance by instructing the subject to take the study treatment exactly as prescr ibed and by stating that compliance is necessary for the subject’s safet y and"
31,page_31,"Novartis Confidential Page 32 Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 00) Protocol No. CLOU064A2201 the validity of the study .It should be emphasized to the patient that the study medication bottles are not identical .The patient must take one capsule from each morning bottle (identified with a sun symbol) in the morning and one capsule from each evening bottle (identified with a moon symbol) in the evening .The subject must also be instructed to contact the investigator if he/she is unable for any reason to take the study treatment as prescribed. Compliance with study treatment will be recorded by the subject in the eDiary . In addition , compliance will be assessed by the investigator and/or study personnel at each visit using capsules counts and information provided by the subject andcaptured in the source document at each visit. All study treatment dispensed and returned must be recorded in the Drug Accountability Log. 6.6.2 Emergency breaking of assigned treatment code Emergency code breaks must only be undertaken when it is required to in order to treat the subject safel y. Most often, study treatment discontinuation and knowledge of the possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study subject who presents with an emergency condition. Emergency treatment code breaks are performed using the IRT. When the investigator contacts the system to break a treatment code for a subject, he/she must provide the requested subject identifying information and confirm the necessit y to break the treatment code for the subject. Theinvestigator will then receive details of the investigational drug treatment for the specified subject and a fax or email confirming this information. The system will automatically inform the Novartis monitor for the site and the study team that the code has been broken. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a dependable procedure in place to allow access to the IRT/code break cards at any time in case of emergency . The investigator will provide: protocol number subject number In addition, oral and written information to the subject must be provided on how to contact his/her backup in cases of emergency, or when he/she is unavailable, to ensure that un -blinding can be performed at an y time. After emergency unblinding the subject will not receive further stud y treatment and will not be able to be enrolled into possible extension studies. 6.7 Preparation and dispensation Each study site will be supplied with study treatment in packaging as described under investigat ional and control drug s section ( 6.1.1 ). A unique medication number is printed on the study medication label. Investigator staff will identify the study medication kits to dispense to the subject by contacting the IRT and obta ining the medication number(s). The study medication has a 2 -part label (base plus tear-off label), immediately before dispensing the medication kit to the subject, site personnel will detach the outer part of the label from the packaging and affix it to the source document."
32,page_32,"Novartis Confidential Page 33 Clinical Trial Protocol ( Version 00) Protocol No. CLOU064A2201 6.7.1 Handling of study treatment and additional treatment 6.7.1.1 Handling of study treatment Study treatment must be received by a designated person at the study site, handled and stored safel y and properl y and kept in a secured location to which only the investigator and designated site personnel have access. Upon receipt, all study treatment must be stored according to the instructions specified on the labels. Clinical supplies are to be dispensed only in accordance with the protocol. Technical complaints are to be reported to the respective Novartis CO Qualit y Assurance. Medication labels will be in the local language and comply with the legal requirements of each country . They will include storage conditions for the study treatment but no infor mation about the subject except for the medication number . The investigator must maintain an accurate record of the shipment and dispensing of study treatment in a drug accountability log. Monitoring of drug accountability will be performed by monitors dur ing site visits or remotely and at the completion of the trial. Subjects will be asked to return all unused study treatment and packaging at the end of the study or at the time of discontinuation of study treatment. At the conclusion of the study , and as appropriate during the course of the study , the investigator will return all unused study treatment, packaging, drug labels, and a copy of the completed drug accountability log to the Novartis monitor or to the Novartis address provided in the investigator folder at each site. 6.7.1.2 Handling of additional treatment The investigator should assess the compliance of each subject in regard to correct use ofthe background H1 -antihistamine at every study visit. As with the study treatment, the impo rtance of compliance with the background medication needs to be discussed with the subject. The use of the rescue H1- antihistamine will be recorded with the eDiary on a daily basis. 6.7.2 Instruction for prescribing and taking study treatment Every subject should take 2 capsules of the assigned LOU064 dose or placebo in the morning and 2 capsules in the evening with a 12 hour interval at approximately the same time every day. Since the study medication bottles are not identical, the patient must take one capsule from each morning bottle (identified with a sun symbol) in the morning and one capsule from each evening bottle (identified with a moon symbol) in the evening. The study medication may be taken with or without a meal but subjects should adhere to their choice throughout thestudy . If taken without food, the study medication should be taken with a glass of water (250 ml) at least 2 hour after the last meal and 1 hour before the next meal. On days of PK assessment , all subjects need to take their study medication on site without food (as described above ). Subjects should be instructed to swallow whole capsules and not to chew or open them. If vomiting occurs during the course of treatment, subjects should not take the study treatment (LOU064) again before the next schedul ed dose. Subjects should be instructed not to make up missed doses. A missed dose is defined as a case when thefull dose is not taken within 4hours after the appro ximate time of the usuall y"

H1-antihistamines taken as background medication and rescue medication, respectivel y, should be taken according to the local treatment instructions. All kits of study treatment assigned by the IRT will be recorded in the IRT sy stem. 7 Informed consent proced ures Eligible subjects may only be included in the study after providing (witnessed, where required by law or regulation), Institutional Review Board/I ndependent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) - approved informed consent. If applicable, in cases where the subje ct's representative(s) gives consent (if allowed according to local requirements), the subject must be informed about the study to the extent possible given his/her understanding. If the subject is capable of doing so, he/she must indicate agreement by personall y signing and dating the written informed consent document. Informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study -specific procedures ( egall of the procedures described in the protocol). The process of obtaining informed consent must be docu mented in the subject source documents. Novartis will provide to investigators in a separate document a proposed ICFthat complies with the ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines and regulatory requirements and is considered appropriate for this study . Any changes to the proposed consent form suggested by the investig ator must be agreed by Novartis before submission to the I RB/IEC. Information about common side effects alread y known about the investigational drug can be found in the IB.This informatio n will be included in the subject informed consent and should be discussed with the subject during the study as needed. Any new information regarding the safet y profile of the investigational drug that is identified between IB updates will be communicated as appropriate, for example, via an investigator notification or an aggregate safet y finding. New information might require an update to the informed consent and then must be discussed with the subject. Women of child bearing potential must be informed that taking the study treatment may involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirements. Male subjects must be informed that if a female partner becomes pregnant while he is enrolled in the study , contact with the female partner will be attempted to request her consent to collect pregnancy outcome information. A copy of the approved version of all consent forms must be provided to Novartis after IRB/IEC approval."

There is no restriction on how much time must pass from the date of screen failure tothe date of re-screening. IF a subject re-screens for the study , then the subject must sign a new ICF and be issued a new subject number prior to any screening assessment being conducted for the subject under the new screening subject number. The investigator/qualified site staff will record if the subject was re-screened on the re-screening eCRF and any applicable screening numbers the subject was issued prior to the current screening number. The date of the new informed consent si gnature must be entered on the i nformed consent eCRF to correspond to the new screening subject number. For re -screening, all screening assessments must be performed per protocol. Information to be collected on screening failures Subjects who sign an ICFand subsequentl y found to be ineligible prior to randomization will be considered a screen failure. The reason for screen failure should be recorded on the appropriate eCRF. The demographic information, informed consent, and Inclusion/Exclusion pages must also be completed for screen failure subjects. No other data will be entered into the clinical database for subjects who are screen failures, unless the subject experienc ed a SAE during the screening Phase (see SAE section for reporting details).

Country specific regulations should be considered for the collection of demographic and baseline characteristics in alignment with eCRF . 8.3 Efficacy All subjects will be provided with an electronic device (eDiary ) that contains the following assessments: Urticaria Patient Daily Diary (UPDD), Angioedema Activity Score (AAS), and Derm atology Life Quality Index (DLQI) . Site and subjects will receive appropriate training and guidance on the use of the eDiary and will receive clear instructions on the completion o f the assessments. Assessments will be completed twice daily (UPDD), once dail y (AAS , if triggered by opening question within the UPDD) or as detailed in the assessment schedule . In general, subject complete eDiary questionnaires at home and independent of study visits. Subjects will be instructed to complete eDiary entries after they took their study medication throughout the treatment period. DLQI questionnaire will be administered during respective visits on siteand should be completed prior to any other study specific procedure .Site personnel must allow subjects to complete the questionnaire on their own without any assistance from the site staff. 8.3.1 eDiary assessments 8.3.1.1 Urticaria Patient Daily Diary (UPDD) UPDD includes Urticaria Activity Score (UAS) which assesses twice daily severit y of itch and number of hives, use of rescue medication, sleep and activity interference, angioedema occurrence, its management and records the calls to an healthcare professional (HCP ) (see Appendix 5). The components are presented in the Table 8-2and the relevant weekly scores are described below.

The DLQ I was validated for patients aged 16 and above. Subjects rate t heir dermatology symptoms as well as the impact of their skin condition on various aspects of their lives thinking about the previous 7 day s. An overall score is calculated and ranges from 0 to 30 (higher score meaning worse disease - related QoL). Domain scores are calculated for: Symptoms and Feelings (0 -6), Daily Activities (0-6), Leisure (0- 6), Work and School (0 -3), Personal Relationships (0- 6), Treatment (0 -3). The overall DLQI score range was split into score bands ( Hongbo et al 2 005)andvalidated in terms of their meaning/relevance to patients as follows: Table 8-7 DLQI score bands and impact on patient’s life DLQI band Significance of score 0-1 No effect on patient ’slife 2-5 Small effect on patient ’s life 6-10 Moderate effect on patient ’s life 11-20 Very large effect on patient ’s life 21-30 Extremely large effect on patient ’s life A DLQI score of > 10 is relevant for a very large impact on patients’ life and justification for a biologic prescription for example in psoriasis ( Kaplan et al 2005 ). The DLQI questionnaires are completed at randomization (Day 1),Weeks 4 (Day 2 9)and W eek 12 (Day 85)in the eDiary . The DLQI should be completed prior to any other assessment and prior to administration of investigational medication. 8.3.3 Other assessments: evidence of urticaria The investigator must confirm the presence of urticaria (i.e. the presence of hives) in each subject before randomization by direct physical examination. In the absence of active disease at the screening and/or randomization visit, the following will be acceptable: (a) a clearl y identifiable photograph of the subject that is no older than 3 months showing the presence of urticaria, (b) the investigator must have seen the subject with active CSU in the past 3 months,"
42,page_42,"Novartis Confidential Page 43 Clinical Trial Protocol (V ersion 00) Protocol No. CLOU064A2201 or (c) the presence of hives/wheals must have been documented in the medical record of the subject by a phy sician trained in the management of urticaria in the past 3 months. 8.3.4 Appropriateness of efficacy assessments At the time the omalizumab studies were carried out, the treatment paradigm focus ed primaril y on itch (ISS7) as a key symptom of CSU. Over the past several years the goal of therapy has evolved and the current target of therapy as described in the current CSU treatment guidelines (Zuberbier et al 2018 ) is to treat the disease until it is gone, i.e. complete control of the disease (UAS7= 0). G iven the current emphasis on UAS7 in the medical community and as reflected in the CSU treatment guidelines, change from baseline in UAS7 will beused to characterize the dose-response relationship of LOU064 administered once or twice dail y. Data collected during this study will be used to provide information that will support selection of doses for further evaluation which may be included in future studies. 8.4 Safet y Safety assessments are specified below with the assessment schedule detailing when each assessment is to be performed. For details on AE collection and reporting, refer t o Secti on 10 ,Safety monitoring and reporting .

The laboratory evaluation plan will provide sufficient safety information for LOU064 in the target population. 8.5 Additional a ssessments 8.5.1 Pharmacokinetics PK samples will be collected at the visits and time points defined in the assessment schedule. Instructions outlined in thelaboratory manual regarding sample collection, numbering, processing and shipment should be followed. Residual PK samples may be used to explore additional PK aspects such as metabolite formation or plasma protein binding of LOU064 . The PK sampling times selected were based on recent PK data as obtained from study CLOU064X2101 . In particular due to the high blood clearance, a more dense sampling at earl y time points is require d."

Therefore and due to the limited sampling up to 4 hours these PK parameters may not be determined. The PK of L OU064 will be characterized at Week 4 and Week 12 across all cohorts. The latter will provide a direct correlation of final safety and efficacy (PK/PD) readouts to exposure in term of AUC and Cmax.

Subjects who discontinue study treatment or who decide they do not wish to participate in the study further should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study UNLESS they withdraw their consent (see withd raw of informed consent section ). Where possible, they should return for the assessments indicated in the assessment schedule. If they fail to return for these assessments for unknown reasons, every effort ( egtelephone, e -mail, letter) should be made to contact the subject/pre -designated contact as specified in the lost to follow -up section. This contact should preferably be done according to the study visit schedule. If the subject cannot or is unwilling to attend any visit(s), the site staff should maintain regular telephone contact with the subject, or with a person pre-designated by the subject. This telephone contact should preferably be done according to the study visit schedule. After study treatment discontinuation, at a minimum, in abbreviated visits, the following data should be collecte d at clinic visits or via telephone/email contact: new/concomitant treatments AEs/SAEs The investigator must also contact the IRT to register the subject’s discontinuation from study treatment. If discontinuation occurs because treatment code has been broken, please refer to Emergenc y breaking of assigned treatment code section (6.6.2 ). 9.1.2 Withdrawal of informed consent Subjects may voluntaril y withdraw consent toparticipate inthestudy foranyreason at an y time.Withdrawal of consent occurs only when asubject: Does not want to participate in the study anymore, and Does not allow further collection of personal data In this situation, the investigator should make a reasonable effort (egtelephone, e -mail, letter) to understand the primary reason for the subject’s decision to withdraw his/her consent and record this information. Study treatment must be discontinued and no further assessment s conducted, and the data that would have been collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing. Further attempts to contact the subject are not allowed unless safety findings require communicating or follow -up. All efforts should be made to complete the assessments prior to study withdrawal. A final evaluation at the time of the subject’s study withdrawal should be made as detailed in the assessment table."
49,page_49,"Novartis Confidential Page 50 Clinical Trial Protocol (V ersion 00) Protocol No. CLOU064A2201 Novartis will continue to keep and use collected study information (including any data resulting from the anal ysis of a subject’s samples until their time of withdrawal) according to applicable law. For US and Japan: All biological sa mplesnot y et anal yzed at the time of withdrawal maystill be used for further testing/analysis in accordance with the terms of this protocol and of the ICF. For EU and rest of the world : All biological samples not y et anal yzed at the time of withdrawal will no longer be used, unless permitted by applicable law. They will be stored according to applicable legal req uirements. 9.1.3 Lost to follow -up For subjects whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to discontinue or withdraw, the investigator must show ""due diligence"" by documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the subject, egdates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. A subject should not be considered as lost to follow -up until due diligence has been completed or until the end of the study . 9.1.4 Early study termination by the sponsor The stud y can be terminated by Nova rtisat any time for any reason. This may include reasons related to the benefit/ risk assessment of participating in the study , practical reasons (including slow enrollment), or for regulatory or medical reasons. In taking the decision to terminate, Novart iswill alway s consider the subject welfare and safet y. Should early termination be necessary , subjects must be seen as soon as possible and treated as a prematurely withdrawn subject. The investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be followe d in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the subject’s interests. The investigator or sponsor depending on the local regulation will be responsible for informing IRBs/IECs of the early termination of the trial. 9.2 Stud y completion and post -study treatment Study completion is defined as when the last subject finishes their Study Completion visit, and any repeat assessments associated with this visit have been documented and followed -up appropriatel y by t he investigator, orin the event of an early study termination decision, the date of that decision. Eligible subjects may roll-over into an extension study (which is in development) after completing investigational treatment (at Week 12) or the follow -up period (at Week 16), following roll-over criteria defined in the extension study protocol, in case the study will be locally implemented."

Therefore, an AE may or may not be temporally or causall y associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product. The investigator has the responsibility for managing the safet y of individual subject and identify ing AEs. Novartis qualified medical personnel will be readily available to advise on trial related medical questions or problems. The occurrence of AEs must be sought b y non -directive questioning of the subject at each visit during the study. AEs also may be detected when they are volunteered by the subject during or between visits or through physical examination findings, laboratory test findings, or other assessments. AEs must be recorded under the signs, symptoms or diagnosis associated with them, accompanied b y the following information (as far as possible) (if the event is serious refer to Section 10.1.2 ): 1. the severit y grade : mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering wi th normal activities moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities severe: prevents normal activities 2.its relationship to the study treatment .If the event is due to lack of efficacy or progression of underl ying illness (i.e. pro gression of the stud y indication) the assessment of causalit y will usually be ‘Not suspected’. The rationale for this guidance is that the sy mptoms of a lack of efficacy or progression of underly ing illness are not caused by the trial drug, they happen in spite of its administration and/or both lack of efficacy and progression of underly ing disease and can only be evaluated meaningfull y by an anal ysis of cohorts, not on a single subject. 3. its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing, an outc ome of not recovered/not resolved must be reported. 4.whether it constitutes a SAE (see Section 10.1.2 for definition of SAE) and which seriousness criteria have been met 5.action taken regarding with study treatment. All AEs must be treated appropriatel y. Treatment may include one or more of the following: dose not changed dose r educed/increased drug interrupted/withdrawn 6.its outcome i.e., its recovery status or whether it was fatal"
51,page_51,"Novartis Confidential Page 52 Clinical Trial Protocol (V ersion 00) Protocol No. CLOU064A2201 Conditions that were alread y present at the time of informed consent should be recorded in medical history of the subject. AEs (including lab abnormalities that constitute AEs) should be described using a diagnosis whenever possible, rather than individual underl ying signs and symptoms. AEmonitoring should becontinued for at least 30 daysfollowing the last dose of study treatment. Once an AEis detected, it must be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent (egcontinuing at the end of the study ), and assessment must be made at each visit (or more frequentl y, if necessary ) of any changes in severity , the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. Information about adverse drug reactions for the investigational drug can be found in the IB. Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute AEs only if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria: they induce clinical signs or sy mptoms they are considered clinically significant they require therapy Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results must be identified through a review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non -typical in subjects with the underly ing disease. See Appendix 1, Appendix 2and Appendix 3for alert ranges for laboratory and other test abnormalities . 10.1.2 Serious adverse events (SAEs) An SAE is defined as any AE[appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing)] undesirable sign(s), s ymptom(s) or medical conditions(s) which meets any one of the following criteria: fatal life-threatening Life-threatening in the context of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe (please refer to the I CH-E2D Guidelines). results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity constitutes a congenital anomaly /birth defect requires inpatient hospitaliz ation or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless hospitalization is for: routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any deterioration in condition elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the subject’s general condition"

Such events should be considered as “medicall y significant”. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse. All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other seriousness crite ria are not met . Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction. All reports of intentional misuse and abuse of the product are also considered SAE irrespective if a clinical event has occurred (see details in Section 10.1.5 ). 10.1.3 SAE reporting To ensure subject safet y, every SAE, regardless of causalit y, occurring after the subject has provided informed consent and until 30 days following the last administration of study treatment must be reported to Novartis safet y within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. Detailed instructions regarding the submission process and requirements are to be found in the investigator folder provided to each site. No p re-specified study endpoint s are considered to be exempted from SAE reporting . 1. Screen Failures (egasubject who is screened but is not treated or randomized): SAEs occurring after the subject has provided informed consent until the time the subject is deemed a Screen Failure must be reported to Novartis /sponsor within 24-hours of learning of its occurrence . 2. Randomized OR Treated Subjects: SAEs collected between time subject signs ICF until 30 days after the subject has discontinued or stopped study treatment All follow -up information for the SAE including information on complications, progression of the initial SAE and recurrent episodes must be reported as follow -up to the original episode within 24 hours of the investigator rece iving the follow -up information. A SAE occurring at a different time interval or otherwise considered completely unrelated to a previously reported one must be reported separatel y as a new event. If the SAE is not previously documented in the IBor Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study treatment, a Chief Medical Office and Patient Safet y (CMO &PS ) Department associate may urgently require further information from the investigator for health authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same study treatment that this SAE has been reported."

Any SAEs experienced after the 30 day period should only be reported to Novartis Safety if the investigator suspects a causal relationship to study treatment. 10.1.4 Pregnancy reporting Pregnancies To ensure subject safety, each pregnancy occurring after signing the informed consent must be reported to Novarti swithin 24 hours of learning of itsoccurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complication s.A minimum of 3 months of the newborn must be followed up. Pregnancy should be recorded and reported by the investigator to the Novartis CMO&PS. Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the study treatment. Any SAE experienced during pregnancy must be reported. Pregnancy outcomes should be collected for the female partners of any males who took study treatment in this study . Consent to report information regarding these pregna ncy outcomes should be obtained from the mother. 10.1.5 Reporting of study treatment errors including misuse/abuse Medication errors are unintentional errors in the prescribing, dispensing, administration or monitoring of a medicine while under the control of a healthcare professional, subject or consumer (EMA definition). Misuse refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriatel y used not in accordance with the protocol. Abuse corresponds to the persistent or sporadic, intentiona l excessive use of a medicinal product, which is accompanied b y harmful ph ysical or ps ychological effects. Study treatment errors and uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF irrespective of whether or not associated with an AE/SAE and reported to Novartis Safet y only if associated with an SAE. Misuse or abuse will be collected and reported in the safet y database irrespective of it being associated with an AE/SAE within 24 hours of Investigator’s awareness.

The following two categories of abnormalities /AEs have to be considered during the course of the study (irrespect ive of whether classified/reported as AE/SAE): Liver laboratory triggers, which will require repeated assessments of the abnormal laboratory parameter Liver events, which will require close observation, follow- up monitoring and contributing factors are rec orded on the appropriate eCRFs Please refer to Table 16-1in Appendix 2for complete definitions of liver laboratory triggers and liver events. Every liver event defined i n Table 16-1should be followed up by the investigator or designated personnel at t he trial site, as summarized below. Additional details on actions required in case of liver e vents are outlined in Table 16-2 in Appendix 2 . Repeat liver chemistry tests (i.e. ALT, AST, Total Bilirubin (TBL) , PT/INR, ALP and GGT) to confirm elevation. These liver chemistry repeats will be performed using the central laboratory . If results will not be available from the central laboratory , then the repeats can also be performed at a local laboratory to monitor the safety of the subject. If a liver event is subsequently reported, any local liver chemistry tests previously conducted that are associated with this event should have results recorded on the appropriate eCRF. If the initial elevation is confirmed, close observation of the subject will be initiated including consideration of treatment interruption if deemed appropriate Discontinuation of the investigational drug (refer to the Discontinuation of study treatment section), if appropriate Hospitalization of the subject if appropriate Causali ty assessment of the liver event Thorough follow -up of the liver event . These investigations can include based on investigator’s discretion: serology tests, imaging and pathology assessments, hepatologist’s consultancy Obtaining a more detailed history of symptoms an d prior or concurrent diseases Obtaining a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications and herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreation al drug use, and special diets Exclusion of underly ing liver disease Obtaining a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents"

The field moni tor will visit the site to check the completeness of subject records, the accuracy of data capture/data entry, the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each site’s data may be performed by a centralized Novartis/delegated CRO/ Clinical Research Associate (CRA) organization. Additionally , a central anal ytics organization may anal yze data & identify risks & trends for site operational parameters, and provide reports to Novartis clinical teams to assist with trial oversight. The investigato r must maintain source documents for each subject in the study , consisting of case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic and medical information, laboratory data, ECGs, and the results of any other tests or assessments . All information on eCRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the subject’s file. The investigator must also keep the original ICFsigned by the subject (a signed copy is given to the subject). The investigator must give the monitor access to a ll relevant source documents to confirm their consistency with the data capture and/or data entry . Novartis monitoring standards require full verification for the presence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation ofSAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the eCRFs are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the subjects will be disclosed. 12 Data analy sis and statistical methods The anal ysis will be conducted on all subject s’data at the time the trial ends.

Audits of investigator sites, vendors, and Novartis systems are performed by auditors, independent from those involved in conducting, monitoring or performing quality control of the clinical trial. The clinical audit process uses a knowle dge/risk based approach. Audits are conducted to assess GCP compliance with global and local regulatory requirements, protocols and internal Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs ), and are performed according to written Novartis processes. 14 Protocol adherence This protocol defines the study objectives, the study procedures and the data to be collected on study participants. Additional assessments required to ensure safety of subjects should be administered as deemed necessary on a case by case basis. Under no circumstances including incidental collection is an investigator allowed to collect additional data or conduct any additional procedures for any purpose involving any investigational drugs under the protocol, other than the purpose of the study . If despite this interdiction prohibition, data, information, observation would be incidentally collected, the investigator shall immediately disclose it to Novartis and not use it for any purpose other than the study , except for the appropriate monitoring on stud y participants. Investigators ascertain they will apply due diligence to avoid protocol deviations. If an investigator feels a protocol deviation would improve the conduct of the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendm ent is agreed upon by Novartis and approved by the IR B/IEC and health authorities, where required, it cannot be implemented. 14.1 Protocol a mendments Any change or addition to the protocol can onl y be made in a written protocol amendment th at must be approved by Novartis , health authorities where required, and the IRB/IEC prior to implementation. Only amendments that are required for subject safet y may be implemented immediately provided the health authorities are subsequently notified by protocol amendment and the reviewing IRB/IEC is notified. Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal protocol amendments, the investigator is expected to take any immediate action required for the safety of any subject included in this study , even if this action represents a deviation from the protocol. In such cases, Novartis should be notified of this action and the IRB/IEC at the study site should be informed according to local regulations."
