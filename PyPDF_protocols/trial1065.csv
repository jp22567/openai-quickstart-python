5,page_5,"Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006 CONFIDENTIAL -6- Subjects will receive SC doses of investigational product ( IP) every 2 weeks under double - blind conditions (Weeks 0 [Day 1], 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, and 34). The last dose will be administered at Week 34, and subjects wi ll complete the treatment period at Week 36 (end of treatment [EOT]). Subsequently, subjects will be followed up at Weeks 40, 44, 48, 52, and 56. The study period will be a maximum of 60 weeks. 1) Screening Period The Investigator will register subjects who provi de written informed consent in an interactive web response system (IWRS) to start screening those subjects withi n 4 weeks after the date of subject’s signature on informed consent . Subjects will undergo baseline assessments at least 2 weeks but not later than 6 weeks after the start of screening. A total of approximately 250 subjects who are considered eligible as a result of the screening and baseline assessments will be enrolled. Subjects will be required to apply a topical emollient , as a rule, twice daily for at least 1 week before baseline visit through the end of the study. The use of topical corticosteroids will be prohibited from at least 1 week before baseline visit through Week 36 assessment . 2) Treatment Period (Day 1 to Week 36) Randomization will be performed within 3 days after baseline visit. Subjects will start study treatment on the day of or the day after randomization (date of the first dose of IP will be regarded a s Day 1). The treatment period is defined as the period between Day 1 and the end of the Week 36 assessment. The study consists of 2 treatment periods. Treatment A period (last dose at Week 16) All subject s who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria during the screen phase will be randomized to one of the treatment groups (placebo, KHK4083 150 mg Q4W , 300 mg Q2W, 600 mg Q2W, or 600 mg Q4W) . In the 150 mg Q4W group and the 600 mg Q4W g roup, placebo will be administered between KHK4083 injections to ensure blinding."

In order to ensure the study blind, the efficacy data until Week 16 shall be entered into the electronic Clinical Outcome Assessment (eCOA) . Treatment B period (last dose at Week 34) Treatment B period is an extension phase where all subjects will receive KHK4083 for an additional 18 weeks under double -blind conditions ( from Week 18 post [IP administration at Week 1 8] through Week 36). In Treatment B period , subjects randomized to the placebo group in Treatment A period will receive SC injections of 600 mg KHK4083 every 2 weeks starting at Week 18. Subjects randomized to any of the KHK4083 groups in Treatment A period will receive KHK4083 at the same dose and dosing interval as in Treatment A period . Subjects who meet withdrawal criterion 5) (Section 4.4.1 ) based on the IGA score at Week 26 will discontinue IP administration at Week 26, undergo end -of-study assessments, and then be withdrawn from the study. Subjects receiving rescue treatment (See Section 6.3.3 ) during the period between the start of IP administration and the end of the Week 36 assessment will discontinue IP, undergo end - of-study assessments, and subsequently be withdrawn from the study . 3) Follow -up Period (up to Week 56) Subjects will enter the follow -up period after the end of the Week 36 assessment and will be followed up every 4 weeks until Week 56. Subjects who received rescue treatment after Week 36 will not b e withdrawn from the study and will be ob served until the end of the study up to We ek 56. 4) Other Potential Study Assessments (optional) Sampling for exploratory biomarkers: Exploratory biomarkers to characterize KHK4083 pharmacodynamic activity will be assessed . At selected investigative sites in the United States and Canada, blood and skin samples will be collected from subjects who voluntarily provide consent to undergo both serum analyses ( including but not limited to serum cytokines"
7,page_7,"Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006 CONFIDENTIAL -8- and chemokines) and skin biopsy. At all investigative sites in Japan, blood and skin samples will be collected from subjects who voluntarily provide consent to undergo both flow cytometry (OX40 -positive T cell and cutaneous lymphocyte -associated antigen [CLA] - positive T memory cell) and skin biopsy. Pharmacogenetic testing: The purpose of this assessment is to explore the association between individual differences in responses to KHK4083 and mutations in DNA sequence. Blood samples will be collected before IP injection at Week 0 from subjects who voluntarily provide consent. IV Number of Subjects A total of approximately 2 50 subjects will be randomly assigned by a 1:1:1:1 :1 ratio to 4 active treatment groups (50 subjects in each group) and one placebo group (50 subjects) in Treatment A period. V Target Subjects Subjects with moderate to severe AD whose disease cannot be adequately controlled with topical medications or for whom topical treatment is medically inadvisable . To allow efficacy and safety assessments in subjects without previous use of biological products , enrollment of subject s who have received previous treatment with biological products for treatment of AD will be limited to no t more than 50% of total enrollment . VI Inclusion Criteria Subjects who meet all of the following criteria will be enrolled in this study: 1) Voluntarily signed informed consent to participate in the study; 2) Men and women ≥18 years at the time of informed consent; 3) Chronic AD, according to American Academy of Dermatology Consensus Criteria (Eichenfield et al, 2014) or the local diagnostic criteria, that has been present for at least 1 year before screening; 4) EASI score ≥16 at screening and baseline ; 5) IGA score ≥3 (moderate) at both screen ing and baseline; 6) BSA ≥10% at both screening and baseline;"
8,page_8,"Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006 CONFIDENTIAL -9- 7) Documented recent history (within 1 year prior to screening visit) of inadequate response to treatment with topical medications or for whom topical treatments are otherwise medically inadvisable (e .g., because of important side effects or safety risks); Note: • Inadequate response is defined as failure to achieve and maintain remission or a low disease activity state (comparable to IGA 0 = clear to 2 =mild) despite treatment with a daily regimen of t opical corticosteroid of medium to higher potency (± topical calcineurin inhibitors as appropriate), applied for at least 28 days or for the maximum duration recommended by the product prescribing information (e.g., 14 days for super -potent topical cortico steroids), whichever is shorter. • Patients with documented systemic treatment for AD in the past 1 year are also considered as inadequate responders to topical treatments and are potentially eligible for treatment with KHK4083 after appropriate washout. • Important side effects or safety risks are those that outweigh the potential treatment benefits and include intolerance to treatment, hypersensitivity reactions, significant skin atrophy, and system ic effects, as assessed by the I nvestigator or by the patient ’s treating physician. 8) Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and fertile men must agree to use highly effective contraceptive methods per the approved local guidance in each country from the time of informed consent to 6 month s after the last dose of IP (for women) or from the start of IP administration to 6 month s after the last dose of IP (for men) . WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at screening and a negative urinary pregnancy test result at baseline ass essments. For the United States and Canada, WOCBP who have sexual intercourse with a non - surgically sterilized male partner must agree and commit to the use one of the following highly effective methods of contraception (Clinical Trials Facilitation Group, 2014) from the time of informe d consent to 6 months after the last dose of IP. Contraceptive methods considered acceptable for use in this study include: a) Established use ( ≥2 mont hs prior to the screening visit) of oral, injected, transdermal or implanted combined estrogen -progestogen hormonal methods of contraception. Subjects who have used such methods for less than 2 months at the screening visit are required to use one of the methods described under b) or c) until the establishment of hormonal contraception methods. b) Double barrier contraception: use of occlusive diaphragm (cap or cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. In countries where spermicidal condoms are not allowed ordinary condoms could be used in combination with spermicidal creams. Appropria te measures are to be determined by the investigator together with the subject, in accordance with the standard of care in the country where treatment is administered. A female condom and a male condom should not be used together as friction between the tw o can result in either, or both product(s) failing. c) An intrauterine device or system. For Germany, WOCBP and fertile men must agree to use highly effective contraceptive methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year from the time of inf ormed consent to 6 months after the last dose of IP (for women) or from the start of IP administration to 6 months after the last dose of IP (for men). WOCBP must have a"
9,page_9,"Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006 CONFIDENTIAL -10- negative serum pregnancy test result at screening and a negative urinary pregnancy tes t result at baseline assessments and at each dose interval. Birth control methods considered highly effective used consistently and correctly include: • Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovula tion – oral – intravaginal – transdermal • Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation – oral – injectable – implantable • Intrauterine device • Intrauterine hormone -releasing system • Bilateral tubal occlusion • Vasectomised partner • Sexual a bstinence (Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of the study treatments). Note: • WOCBP exclude women who have undergone permanent sterilization, those who are postmenopausal [defined as the absence of menstruation for at least 12 consecutive months without any other medical reason (or in postmenopausal range per local laboratory standards) ], and those anatomically having no childbear ing potential.

26,page_26,"Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006 CONFIDENTIAL -27- 1 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Medical Background OX40 (CD134, TNFR superfamily 4), a tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family member, represents a novel target mole cule. OX40 costimulatory signaling has been shown to play a key role in maintaining late T -cell proliferation and survival and in inducing T -cell memory formation ( Salek -Arda kani et al, 2006; Croft , 2010; Croft [a], 2009). Survival is increased by suppression of apoptosis ( Song et al, 2005; Rogers et al, 2001). OX40 is mostly expressed on activated, but not naïve, CD4 and CD8 T cells such as T-helper (Th)1, Th2, and Th17 lymphocytes ( Croft , 2010). The OX40 transient expression pattern is unique, increasing only after antigen -specif ic major histocompatibility complex -induced T cell receptor (TCR) activation and decreasing quickly after activation. The OX40 ligand is a transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the TNF superfamily and its expression is induced on antigen -presenting c ell including activated B cells, mature conventional dendritic cells , Langerhans cells, and macrophages. OX40 ligand is also inducible on some activated CD4 and CD8 T cells, NK cells , mast cells and during conditions of inflammation, on vascular endothelia l and smooth muscle cells ( Croft , 2010; Croft [b], 2009). Blocking OX40 signaling has resulted in inhibition of T cell responses and pathogenic symptoms in animal models of autoimmune diseases ( Salek -Arda kani et al, 2006; Croft [a], 2009). In humans, OX40 expression has been observed on T cells in diseased, but not in non - diseased, areas in psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and atopic dermatitis (AD) ( Matsumura et al, 2003 ; Cavanagh and Hussel, 2008). OX40 expression has been also observed on human T cells in several immune -based diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), type 1 diabetes, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus ( Dolff et al, 2010), lupus nephritis ( Farres et al, 2011), bone marrow transplants, skin allografts, and heart disease (acute myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy) ( Salek -Arda kani et al, 2006; Croft , 2010). The infiltration of OX40+ T cells is enhanced in the gastrointestinal tissue of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease, and celiac disease ( Stüber et al, 2000)."
27,page_27,"Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006 CONFIDENTIAL -28- 1.2 Atopic Dermatitis AD is defined as pruritic, eczematous dermatitis with symptoms that chronically fluctuate with remissions and relapses. Pathologically, AD is accompanied by the cutaneous physiological dysfunction of dry and barrier -disrupted skin due to abnormalities of t he epidermis, especially the horny cell layers, and follows a chronic course with eczema characterized by inflammation due to the intervention of various unspecific stimulation or specific allergens. Most patients with AD have atopic diathesis (personal or family history [one or more of asthma, allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis, and AD], or predisposition to overproduction of immunoglobulin [Ig] E antibodies) (Bieber , 2010 ). For the diagnosis of AD , the diagnostic criteria defined by Hanifin and Rajka in 1980 are frequently used for the diagnosis of AD in the world (Hanifin and Rajka, 1980 ). A revision of the diagnostic criteria was accomplished by Williams ( Williams et al, 1994). The atopic dermatitis severity classifications that are mainly used are the Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) established by the European Task Force on Atopic D ermatitis (European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis , 1993) and the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) (Hanifin et al, 2001). In addition to these severity classifications, measurements such as peripheral blood eosinophil count, serum total IgE, lactate dehydrogenase, and thymus and activation regulated chemokine (TARC) are used as reference indicators of severity or disease activity of AD. AD is a disease due to multiple causes including gene factors. At present, there are no drugs that can completely heal the disease. Therefore, al l available drug therapies are symptomatic and focus on the improvement or relief of symptoms. The main drug therapy for skin inflammation is topical treatment primar ily with topical corticosteroids ( TCSs) or tacrolimus ointment ( Saeki et al, 2016). T CS of appropriate potency is selected for use according to the severity of each eruption. Tacrolimus ointment is used for eruptions that are difficult to treat with existing therapies such as TCSs because of an inadequate response or side effects and are applied to eruption areas except for ulcers and erosions with obvious plaque formation. Topical agents that improve eruptio ns are available; however, since AD is a long -standing disease, discomfort associated with some types of ointment bases and burden for patients and their family of applying topical agents to wide areas of skin every day, which takes more time and trouble t han taking oral corticosteroids, lead to low treatment compliance ( Ohya et al, 2001). Side effects caused by TCSs include vasodilatation, skin atrophy, and induction of skin infections, and the higher the potency of the TCS, the more attention is required to side"
28,page_28,"Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006 CONFIDENTIAL -29- effects. Oral corticosteroids and oral cyclosporine are used against symptoms of skin inflammation in patients with sever e or very seve re AD ( Saeki et al, 2016). Oral corticosteroids are used at the time of acute flare or for patients with severe or very severe AD as induction therapy. However, the use of oral corticosteroids should be minimized, considering systemic side effects due to long -term use such as adrena l function suppression and rebound phenomenon after discontin uation of treatment ( Saeki et al, 2016). Oral cyclosporine is indicated only for a dult patients with severe AD who have inadequately responded to existing therapies such as TCS s or tacrolimus ointment and have 30% or more skin involvement by eruption with severe inflammation. Although the efficacy of oral cyclosporine on eruptions has b een demonstrated, the target patients and treatment duration are limited because of its side effects such as renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and infections . 1.3 KHK4083 KHK4083 is a fully human, non -fucosylated IgG 1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) developed by Kyowa Kirin Co., Ltd (formerly, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd) . KHK4083 binds to OX40 and blocks the action . It is known that the removal of the core fucose from the biantennary complex -type oligosaccharides attached to the Fc region of the antibody therapeutics dramatically enhances the antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity mediated by binding to Fc γRIIIa. The mechanism of action of KHK4083 includes the selective depletion of activated T cells by ADCC and the antagonistic suppression of clonal T cell expansion. OX40 is known to have an important role in the signaling and induction of Th2 cells in AD (Guttman -Yassky et al, 2013). KHK4083, selectively depleting OX40+ activated T cells by ADCC, is expected to improve AD, which is a disease caused by activated Th2 cells ( Leung and Guttman -Yassky , 2014 ; Malajian and Guttman -Yassky , 2015 ). Allergy is induced by a series of immune cascades consisting of generation of multiple cytokines, induction of lymphocyte activation including IgE -producing B cells, and activatio n of multiple immune cells including eosinophils and mast cells. As one of the triggers of the immune activation cascades, myeloid dendritic cells are activated by thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) of epithelial origin and express OX40 ligands and CCL17 (TARC). It activates the activation and sustained growth of effector Th2 cells, causing induction and exacerbation of allergic inflammation (Ito et al, 2005 ; Wang et al, 2006). Immune responses induced by TSLP in the skin (e.g., Th2 inflammatory cell infiltration, cytokine secretion, and"
29,page_29,"Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006 CONFIDENTIAL -30- IgE production) were inhibited in mice with OX40L -blocking ( Seshasayee et al, 2007). These findings indicate that the anti -OX40 antibody KHK4083 may contribute to establish a new treatment strategy for AD . 1.3.1 Non-Clinical Studies The generation of the KHK4083 mAb and its in vitro characterization as well as the nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicology study reports are thoroughly described in the Investigator’s Brochure. All nonclinical safety studies were conducted in Japan, a country which is one of the mem bers of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Mutual Acceptance of Data Program , and were also conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). The nonclinical/toxicological program includes two pivotal GLP studies in cynom olgus monkeys: a 4-week intravenous (IV) study (SBL303 -081) and a 26 -week subcutaneous (SC) study (SBL303 -104). In Study SBL303 -081, no toxicologically significant changes were observed at doses up to 100 mg/kg when KHK4083 ( 0, 3, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg ) was intravenously administered to male and female cynomolgus monkeys once weekly for 4 weeks. In Study SBL303 -104, KHK4083 (0, 0.3, 3, or 30 mg/kg) was subcutaneously administered to male and female cynomolgus monkeys once every 2 weeks for 26 weeks. An IV group given 30 mg/kg KHK4083 was included to compare toxicity with the SC group. There were no toxicological changes in any groups including the IV group, and the no -observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL) of KHK4083 was 30 mg/kg (both SC and IV) in male s and females. A 4 -week toxicological study of SC doses of KHK4083 (0, 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg ) administered every 2 weeks was conducted by using a highly concentrated IP formulation (Process 2 formulation), which was expected to be used in clinical studies. The study was conducted for determination of local tolerance, toxicokinetic assessments, measurement of anti -KHK4083 antibodies, and supplemental toxicological examinations. In this study, neither systemic toxicity nor local irritation was observed at the site of administration up to 100 mg/kg . 1.3.2 Clinical Studies The Phase 1a (single ascending dose)/Phase 1b (double -blind, placebo -controlled, single ascending dose) study of KHK4083 in subjects with mild to moderate plaque -type psoriasis was conducted in Canada by Kyowa Kirin Pharmaceutical Development, Inc. (KKD), the Sponsor, and completed in Decembe r 2014 (Study 4083 -001). In this s tudy, a total of"
30,page_30,"Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006 CONFIDENTIAL -31- 55 subjects received 0.003 to 10 mg/kg KHK4083 (IV dose at 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1 .0, 3.0, or 10 mg/kg and SC dose at 1 mg/kg) (Papp et al, 2017) . No dose -limiting toxicity was identified at any dose, and KHK4083 was well -tolerated. Currently, a Phase 2a (double -blind, placebo -controlled, multiple ascending dose, long -term extension) study of multiple IV doses of 1 to 10 mg/kg KHK4083 or placebo is ongoing in 66 subjects randomized with moderately active UC in Europe and the United States (Study 4083 -002). No dose -limiting toxic ities were identified in that t rial, as per the cut off date ( Oct 2018 ). KHK4083 had demo nstrated reasonable safety and tolerability in subject s with UC. In Japan , a Phase 1 ( Study 4083 -003), single -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, single - dose or open -label multiple -dose study of KHK4083 in healthy male adults and subjects with moderately active UC was conducted by KHK, the Sponsor, and complete d the last protocol - specified exa mination in February 2018 . In Part 1 of the study, 32 Japanese subjects (8 subjects [KHK4083, 6 subjects; placebo, 2 subjects] per cohort × 4 ) or 16 Caucasian subjects (8 subjects [KHK4083, 6 subjects; placebo, 2 subjects] per cohort × 2 ) receive d a single IV infusion (1, 3, or 10 mg/kg) or SC injection (3 mg/kg) of KHK4083 in a placebo -controlled, single -blind manner. In Part 2 of the study, 8 subjects with UC receive d multiple IV infusions of 10 mg/kg KHK4083 in an open -label manner. No dose -limiting toxicity was observed during a 6 -week open -label treatment period when 3 IV doses were administered every 2 weeks at dose of 10 mg/kg and during a 16 -week follow -up period . In this study, the safety and tolerabili ty of KHK4083 were demonstrated in healthy men and subject s with moderately active UC, and the efficacy of KHK4083 was demonstrated in subjects with UC . In addition, a Phase 1 (Study 4083 -004), open -label, repeated -dose study of KHK4083 in subjects with mo derate to severe AD was conducted in Japan by KHK, the Sponsor, and complete d the last protocol -specified examination in February 2018. In Study 4083 -004, a total of 22 subjects received multiple IV doses of 10 mg /kg KHK4083 . In this study, the safety and tolerability of KHK4083 were demonstrated during a 6 -week open -label treatment period when 3 IV doses (10 mg/kg) were administered every 2 weeks . Despite the low number of patients t he efficacy of KHK 4083 was demonstrated in these subjects over the course of the treatment and 16-week follow -up period s."

Moderate to severe AD is characterized by rash, which is accompanied by continuous intense, intractable itching, dry skin, skin cracks, erythema, scabs, and capillary hemorrhage. Itching is the wasting symptom representing the greatest burden for patients and may affect the various aspects of patients’ daily life such as sleep ( Zuberbier et al, 2006 ). The potential benefit of treatment with KHK4083 is to improve skin symptoms in patients with AD, which is mainly caused by Th2 cells ( Leung and Guttman -Yassky , 2014 ; Malajian and Guttman -Yassky , 2015). Continuation of therapy is expected to sustain improved skin symptoms and also improve other symptoms of AD . 1.5 Rational e for Conduct ing the Study Study 4083 -004 was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability , and PK of repeated IV doses of 10 mg/kg KHK4083 in Japanese subjects with moderate to severe AD. In Study 4083 -004, the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of 10 mg/kg KHK4083 were demonstrated.

Subjects will undergo baseline assessments at least 2 weeks but not later than 6 weeks after the start of screening. A total of approximately 250 subjects who are considered eligible as a result of the screening and baseline assessments will be enrolled. Subjects will be required to apply a topical emollient, as a rule, twice daily for at least 1 week before baseline visit through the end of the study.

In Treatment B period , subjects randomized to the placebo group in Treatment A period will receive SC injections of 600 mg KHK4083 every 2 weeks starting at Week 18. Subjects randomized to any of the KHK4083 groups in Treatment A period will rec eive KHK4083 at the same dose and dosing interval as in Treatment A period .

38,page_38,"Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006 CONFIDENTIAL -39- Pharmacogenetic testing: The purpose of this assessment is to explore the association between individual differences in responses to KHK4083 and mutations in DNA sequence. Blood samp les will be collected before IP injection at Week 0 from subjects who voluntarily provide consent . 3.2 Rationale for Study Design This is a multicenter, Phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SC doses of KHK4083 300 mg or 600 mg administered every 2 weeks, or 150 mg or 600 mg administered every 4 weeks compared with placebo in subjects with moderate to severe AD. In ord er to assess improvement of skin symptoms, the percent change from baseline in EASI score at Week 16 is selected as the primary endpoint . TCSs, which may significantly affect the efficacy , will be prohibited from 1 week before the start of IP administratio n until the end of the treatment period. During this period, an emollient will be used instead of TCSs. In a Phase 1 study (Study 4083 -004), a total of 3 doses of 10 mg/kg KHK4083 were intravenously administered every 2 weeks to subjects with moderate to s evere AD, the same population as this study. The results indicated that a trend toward improvement of skin symptoms was sustained even in a 16 -week follow -up period after the end of treatment with KHK4083. On the basis of this finding, a placebo -controlled treatment phase (Treatment A) will be followed by an 18 -week extension phase ( Treatment B period ) in this study so as to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the long -term administration of KHK4083 after the primary efficacy evaluation at Week 16. In addit ion, as with Study 4083 -004, Study 4083 - 006 includes a 20 -week follow -up period, the duration of which may be sufficient to evaluate the sustained of efficacy and safety of KHK4083 after the end of the treatment period. Interim analyses will be conducted a t the time when all subjects have completed assessments at Week 16 and Week 36 to obtain preliminary information for planning a future study of KHK4083 for the treatment of AD . 3.3 Enrollment A total of approximately 250 subjects with moderate to severe AD will be enrolled in this study. The Investigator will enroll subjects according to the following procedure."
39,page_39,"Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006 CONFIDENTIAL -40- 1) Before starting the study -specific procedures, written informed consent (or assent, if applicable) should be o btained from potentially eligible subjects. 2) At each investigative site, a subject identifier (ID) will be assigned through the IWRS to each subject who provides consent, according to the following rule. The same ID will be used from the time of informed co nsent through the end of the study. ID: 4083 -006-XX-YY-ZZ XX: Country code ( e.g., JP, Japan , US, the United States , CA , Canada, GE, Germany ) YY: Investigative site code ZZ: Sequential number for subjects providing consent at the investigative site For exam ple, the subject ID of the first subject who provides consent at ### hospital (investigative site code: 01) in Japan is 4083 -006-JP-01-01. 3) Subjects will be assessed for eligibility. 4) Eligible subjects will be registered as an enrolled subject in the IWRS. 5) A subject who is not eligible may be re -screened at the discretion of the Investigator after re-obtaining written informed consent. Subjects will be permitted to be re -screened only once. Chest X ray (or CT scan) at re -screening may be omitted upon consultation with the Sponsor only if there are no findings suggestive of tuberculosis ( TB) at the initial screening . The subject ID of re -screened subjects will be the same as that initiall y assigned. Details of the subject enrollment method are specified in separate written procedures. 3.4 Randomization and Blinding 3.4.1 Randomization Randomization will be performed through the IWRS in the order of enrollment. Subjects who meet all of the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to receive 150 mg Q4W , 300 mg Q2W, 600 mg Q2W , or 600 mg Q4W KHK4083 or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 :1 ratio by the IWRS according to a dynamic allocation procedure. Randomization will be performed within 3 days after baseline assessments. The severity of AD (moderate, IGA=3; severe, IGA=4) at baseline , region (Japan, rest of world ), and previous use of biological products (Yes, No) for the treatment of AD at baseline will be used as stratification factors for randomization by prioritizing them . Detailed written procedures for randomization will be provided separately from the protocol ."
40,page_40,"Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006 CONFIDENTIAL -41- Randomization tran saction of IWRS would decide each subject treatment arm allocation and at the same time indicated drug number (Kit No.) to be dispensed. The Kit No. shall be entered into the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF ). 3.4.2 Blinding 3.4.2.1 Creation and Storage of Allocation Table PAREXEL International Inc ., Japan will prepare a drug randomization list and allocate IP to each subject with the IWRS according to separate written procedures. The drug randomization will be adaptive based on separ ate written procedures. The subject treatment group will be allocated by the IWRS according to the separate written procedures. PAREXEL International Inc., Japan will create treatment assignment list that will be provided at the interim analysis following separate written procedures and will provide a record of emergency unblinding from the IWRS as required . 3.4.2.2 Blinding Method The st udy will be blinded to all study personnel/consultants, investigative site personnel, and study subjects. However, the study will be unblinded to selected personnel as follows. In this study, a pharmacist who is unblinded to treatment assignment (“unblinded pharmacist”) (or qualifi ed designee) will be registered at each investigative site beforehand. The unblinded pharmacist (or qualified designee) will prepare the IP dose for SC injection according to the assigned treatment. Details are specified in the Pharmacy Manual, which is separately provided. Persons to be unblinded from the start of this study include unblinded pharmacist (or qualified designee) , unblinded drug supply managers responsible for managing IP logistics and unblinded monitor responsible for monitoring the IP is st ored, controlled and prepared according to the procedures of the Contract Research Organization (CRO), and safety personnel of the Sponsor who reports certain serious adverse events ( SAE s) to the regulatory authorities ; and persons to be unblinded after the interim analysis at Week 16 include personnel at interim analysis center of CRO and person responsible for PK and biomarkers of the Sponsor. The individuals will be identified in the separate document of Blinding Pla n and Unblinding Processes."
41,page_41,"Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006 CONFIDENTIAL -42- The allocation of IP to the subject will be managed by the IWRS, the unblinded pharmacist (or qualified designee) will be given information on the IP allocation electronically via the IWRS. 3.4.2.3 Measures Taken to Maintain Blindness Assignment Based on Known Information on KHK4083 Test results on serum KHK4083 concentrations, anti -KHK4083 antibodies, TARC, serum total IgE, OX40 -positive cells in skin and peripheral blood, and CLA -positive memory T cells in peripheral blood (Japan only ) may unblind the subject treatment group based on serum drug concentration, immune response or KHK4083 mechanism of action . Therefore, those results must not be provided to the Investigator or site staff, who are involved in treatment or clinical assessme nts of subjects, or Sponsor/CRO personnel (except personnel at interim analysis center of CRO and person responsible for PK and biomarkers of the Sponsor) until the study is unblinded by the Sponsor, with the exception of when the knowledge of the test res ult is necessary to ensure subject safety or to submit an expedited report of a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) to the Regulatory agencies . The Investigator must notify the Sponsor if they become aware of any test result regardless of the reason. 3.4.2.4 Unblinding The Sponsor reserves the right to unblind an individual subject 's treatment for the purposes of fulfilling regulatory requirements for expedited reporting of adverse events ( AEs) and/or subject safety. A subject’s treatment assignment should only b e unblinded by the Investigator or Sponsor when knowledge of the treatment is essential for the further management of the subject or may impact the safety of subj ects in current and/or subsequent cohorts. The emergency unblinding process will be identified in the separate document of Emergency Unblinding Procedure . In the following cases, the Investigator will immediately notify the Sponsor and withdraw the relevan t subject from the study . • Any study staff (the Principal Investigator , sub -Investigator, or clinical research coordinator) other than the unblinded pharmacist becomes aware of the treatment assignment of the subject. • The knowledge of the treatment group of the subject is necessary to take measures against a TEAE.

The Sponsor has primary responsibility for the ongoing medical review of safety data throughout the study. Recommendations will be made with the input of the Medical Monitor to the Principal Investigator and other appropriate designated staff regarding further conduct of the study . Currently, based on safety observations from existing clinical trials, the infusion or injection reactions are identified as AE of special interest for KHK4083. However, the following safety events will also be considered as AEs of special interest . Detailed written procedures for the follow -up AEs of special interest will be provided separately from the protocol . • Malignancy • Infec tions (particularly TB , serious infections, opportunistic infections, or infections requiring systemic antibiotic therapy) • Injection site reactions • Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) • Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic and serum sickness -like reactions) • Neuropsychiatric events ( including suicidal ideation and behavior) 3.5.1 Injection -related Reaction The Inv estigator should monitor subjects for acute drug reactions at the investigative site for at least 2 hours after IP administration for visits at Day 1 , Weeks 2, 4, 18, 20, and 22 . At all other visits subjects will be monitored for acute drug reactions at th e investigative site for at least 30 minut es after IP administration. However, subjects will stay longer at the site for observation whenever it is clinically required and at the discretion and clinical judgment of the Investigator. Refer to Section 6.2.3 for detail on measures to be taken for acute reactions. No pre -medication (e.g., acetaminophen, anti -emetic; 5HT3 blocker; histamine H1 and/or H2 blocker[s]) is planned to be routinely/prophylactically administered prior to IP administration"

However, pre -medication may be used prior to IP administration as per the decision of the Investigator upon approval of the Sponsor; or the Sponsor may recommend the pretreatment of subjects to the Principal Investigator if consistent mild (Grade 1 ) and/or moderate (Grade 2 ) injection reactions are observed during the course of the study . Refer to Section 7.9.8.1 for reporting an injection -related reaction including descriptions of specific symptoms observed or reported by the subject. Each investigative site must have trained staff and immediate access to emergency supplies and equipment including, but are not limited to, drugs needed to treat a subject in case of a life threatening emergency. 3.5.2 Contraception The Investigator will instruc t subjects to use highly effective contraceptive methods per the approved local guidance in each country from the day of provi ding informed consent through 6 months after the last dose of IP for women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and from the start da y of IP administration through 6 months after the last dose of IP for men with reproductive capability. The Investigator will thoroughly explain the risks in pregnancy and the effective contraceptive methods to the subjects. Actions will be taken according to Section 7.9.8.3 , if a female subject becomes pregnant after providing informed consent, or if a partner of a male subject becomes pregnant after the start of IP administration until 6 months after the last dose of IP . 4 SUBJECT ELIGIBILITY AND WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA 4.1 Target Sub jects Subjects with moderate to severe AD whose disease cannot be adequately controlled with topical medications or for whom topical treatment is medically inadvisable. To allow efficacy and safety assessments in subjects without previous use of biological products, enrollment of subjects who have received previous treatment with biological products for the treatment of AD will be limited to not more than 50% of total enrollment."

W OCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at screening and a negative urinary pregnancy test result at baseline assessments . For the Un ited States and Canada, WOCBP who have sexual intercourse with a non - surgically sterilized male partner must agree and commit to the use one of the following highly effective methods of contraception (Clinical Trials Facilitation Group, 2014) from the time of informed consent to 6 months after the last dose of IP. Contraceptive methods considered acceptable for use in this study include: a) Established use (≥2 months prior to the screening visit) of oral, injected, transdermal or implanted combined estrogen -progestogen hormonal methods of contraception. Subjects who have used such methods for less than 2 months at the screening visit are"

In countries where spermicidal condoms are not allowed ordinary condoms could be used in combination with spermicidal creams . Appropriate measures are to be determined by the investigator together with the subject, in accordance with the standard of care in the country where treatment is administered. A female condom and a male condom should not be used together as friction bet ween the two can result in either, or both product(s) failing. c) An intrauterine device or system. For Germany, WOCBP and fertile men must agree to use highly effective contraceptive methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% per year from the time of informed consent to 6 months after the last dose of IP (for women) or from the start of IP administration to 6 months after the last dose of IP (for men). WOCBP must have a negative serum pregnancy test result at screening and a negative urinary pr egnancy test result at baseline assessments and at each dose interval. Birth control methods considered highly effective used consistently and correctly include: • Comb Combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation – oral – intravaginal – transdermal • Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation – oral – injectable – implantable • Intraut erine device • Intrauterine hormone -releasing system • Bilateral tubal occlusion • Vasectomised partner • Sexual abstinence (Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire per iod of the study treatments). Note: • WOCBP exclude women who have undergone permanent sterilization, those who are p ostmenopausal [defined as the absence of menstruation for at least 12 consecutive months without any other medical reason (or in postmenopausal range per local laboratory standards) ], and those anatomically having no childbearing potential."

Subject will be withdrawn from the study if any of the following events occur : 1) Subject is found to be ineligible after the start of the study, not meeting the eligibility criteria . This may include, but is not limited to, the following events: • Diagnosis of a malignancy during study • Active TB or opportunistic infection 2) Subject experiences a serious, acute in jection reaction despite administration of a prophylactic regimen or subject experiences anaphylaxis regardless of having received a pre-medication regimen or not; 3) Two consecutive doses of IP are not administered as schedule d or 3 or more doses are skipped during the treatment period . However, the subject who meets this criterion due to the logistical issue caused by the COVID -19 outbre ak such as restriction on traveling, isolation etc., is allowed to remain in the study by the Investigato r’s discretion . Once the subject is abl e to make visits, he or she continue s with IP administration and other procedures required by this protocol . However, missed visits may not be repeated. For example, if a subject missed Week 26 and 28 visits , and then makes a visit to the site again on the scheduled date for Week 30, asses sments for Week 30 should be conducted instead of Week 26 assessments. If a subject returns to the site on Week 36 or later, no IP administration should occur ; 4) Subject receives rescue treatment (See Section 6.3.3 ) during t he treatment period; 5) IGA score at Week 26 remains unchanged or has worsen ed from both baseline (Week 0) and Week 18; 6) Subject experiences an AE, and the Investigator determines that treatment should be discontinued and the subject should be withdrawn from the study after follow -up.

Each subject will r eceive three SC injections of 2 mL each at every dosing visit. For subjects who complete all 18 dosing visits from Week 0 until Week 34 , the total number of injections duri ng the study will be 54. The procedure for preparing the KHK4083 dose for SC injection is provided in the Pharmacy Manual. A designated unblinded pharmacist (or qualified designee) at each investigative site will withdraw the required amount of IP from des ignated 7 vials into syringes . The method of IP administration is specified in the Pharmacy Manual. The Principal Investigator, sub -Investigator, clinical research coordinator (nurse), or other healthcare professional will administer IP subcutaneously in t he abdomen, thigh, upper arm, or other appropriate sites. The site of injection should be rotated so that IP is not injected into the same site consecutively. Before IP administration, the Investigator should make sure that there are no skin disorders such as erythema, redness, pain, or swelling in the area for injection . 6.2.2 Dose Modification No dose modifications of IP will be permitted in this study. IP administration may be suspended only if dose interruption is considered necessary because of an AE. IP administration may be resumed if the symptom has resolved and the Investigator determines that the subject can be rechallenged with IP.

Therefore, the Investigator must carefully monitor subjects for injection -related reactions or other TEAEs occurring after each IP administration to confirm the safety of each subject after injection as speci fied below. Day 1, Weeks 2, 18, and 20 : Vital signs will be measured before IP administration. Subjects will remain and be monitored at the investigative site for at least 2 hours after IP administration. In addition, vital signs will be measured 2 hours (±10 minutes) after IP administration. Week s 4 and 22 : Vital signs will be measured before IP administration. Subjects will remain and be monitored at the investigative site for at least 2 hours after IP administration. Administr ation time points other than above: Vital signs will be measured before IP administration. Subjects will remain and be monitored at the investigative site for at least 30 minutes after IP administration. However, subjects will stay longer at the site for observation whenever it is clinically required and at the discretion and clinical judgment of the Investigator. No pre -medication (e.g., acetaminophen, anti-emetic; 5HT3 blocker; histamine H1 and/or H2 blocker[s]) is planned to be routinely/prophylactically administered prior to KHK4083 injection in this study. However, appropriate measures should be selected to treat individual subjects at the discretion of the Investigator upon approval of the Sponsor . If consistent mild (Grade 1) and/or moderate (Grade 2) injection reactions are observed, the Sponsor may recommend the pretreatment of subjects to the Principal Investigator . Any subject experiencing an acute reaction must receive immediate medical assessment and indicated supportive management according to t he institutional standard of care and local Principal Investigator judgment until the signs/symptoms of the reaction have resolved . Refer to Section 7.9.8.1 for reporting an injection -related reaction including descriptions of specific symptoms observed or reported by the sub jects."
57,page_57,"Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006 CONFIDENTIAL -58- 6.2.4 Rationale for Route of Administration, Dosing Regimen, and Treatm ent Duration The inhibitory activity of KHK4083 against OX40 was saturated at approximately 10 μg/mL (see Section 4.1.2.3 of the Investigator’s Brochure Edition 07). The ADCC activity of KHK4083 almost reached the maximum at approximately 1 μg/mL (see Section 4.1.2.5 of the Investigator’s Brochure Edition 07). In Study 4083 -004, the amount of unoccupied OX40 recovered from around Week 14, and the serum concentration at the same time point was also around 10 μg/mL (Figure 6.2.4 -1). The effective serum concentration in patients with AD was thus estimated to be 10 μg/mL. The comparison of serum concentration betwee n observed values and the median of a 1000 -subject simulation (solid line; dotted line = 5 and 95 percentiles) is shown in Figure 6.2.4 -1. Figure 6.2.4 -1 Compari son of serum concentration between Population Analysis Results and Observed Values in Study 4083 -004 Preliminary results based on the clinical database as of 13 Mar 2018."
58,page_58,"Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006 CONFIDENTIAL -59- The trough concentration following multiple SC doses of KHK4083 every 2 or 4 weeks was simulated using the population PK parameters in patients with AD and the PK parameters of absorption phase after SC dosing in Study 4083 -003 ( Figure 6.2.4 -2). The trough concentration at week 16 was expected to reach the estimated effective serum concentration (10 µg/mL) in almost all patients with AD at 300 mg Q2W, 600 mg Q4W, and 600 mg Q2W. On the other hand, the serum trough concentration of KHK4083 at week 16 was estimated to exceed 10 µg/mL in only 20% of the patients at 150 mg Q4W. Given that the tissue distribution of most antibodies is approximately 10% ( Lobo et al, 2004; Wang et al, 2008 ), when the serum concentrat ion of KHK4083 exceeded 100 µg/mL, the estimated effective concentration was expected to be achieved also in the skin, which is the site of the disease, providing an additional pharmacological effect. The serum trough concentration at week 16 was estimated to exceed 100 µg/mL in 50% o f the patients at 600 mg Q2W .

The effect of dosing interval could be investigated by comparing the 600 mg Q4W regimen and the 300 mg Q2W regimen, in which the total dose is almost equivalent to that of the 600 mg Q4W regimen. In addition, the relationship between exposure and response could be extensively investigated by including the 150 mg Q4W group, in which the serum trough concentration at week 16 is expected to reach the estimated effective serum concentration in approximately 20% of patients with AD . 6.3 Concomitant Medications and T herapies The following information will be recorded on the eCRF, i f a subject receives any medication or therapy during the period from day of informed consent until the end (early termination) of the study : • Generic name of medication or therapy • Route of administration • Start date and end date of medication • Reason for use (indication) Regarding the name of medicine, the generi c names are preferred.

If the subject is using any emollient as prior medication, the dosing regimen of the emollient must be switched to that prescribed by the Investigator at least 1 week before baseline visit. If the subject is not using any emollients as prior medication, an emollient designated by the Investigator will be newly prescribed at least 1 week b efore baseline visit. Subjects will be required to apply a topical emollient , as a rule, twice daily during the study period. The application of the emollient must be continued at the same regimen throughout the study period even after improvement of AD symptoms . In the United States, Canada, and Germany, over -the-counter emollients can be used instead of prescription emollients from at least l week before baseline visit through the end of the study with approval from the Investigator."

The blood samples will be anonymized with subject IDs and stored at a sample -archiving facility. The date of consent and the date of blood c ollection will be entered into the eCRF. If a subject withdraws consent to the collection, storage, and use of blood samples for the pharmacogeneti c testing , the investigative site should immediately notify the Sponsor of the withdrawal. The Sponsor will i nstruct the sample -archiving facility to destroy the relevant samples. The sample -archiving facility will destroy the samples and submit a certificate of destruction to the Sponsor. The Sponsor will designate a biobanking manager . The pharmacogeneti c testing using archived samples will be conducted only if the Sponsor considers it useful to explore mutatio ns in DNA sequence (e.g., genetic polymorphism) that are associated with responses to KHK4083. Candidate genes may include, but are not limited to, IL-4R, FLG, IL -4, IL -13, SPINK5, and STAT 6. When the s chedule or contents of pharmacogenetic testing using samples is specified, a “Pharmacogenetic Tes ting Protocol” will also be prepared before the testing is initiated. Measurement of pharmacogenetics will be conducted by the Sponsor or a company working"
77,page_77,"Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006 CONFIDENTIAL -78- with the Sponsor. The results of this pharmacogenetics may be reported separately and may not form pa rt of the Clinical Study Report. The scientific reliability, such as accuracy or certainty, of resu lts obtained from pharmacogeneti c testing using archived samples is unknown at present. Therefore, any obtained results ( e.g., pharmacogen etic test results) will not be disclosed to subjects. However, the obtained information will be disclosed to subjects (1) when the subject requests disclosure of test results according to laws related to personal information protection and the claim is considered to meet rel evant requirements; or (2) when an ethics review committee established by the Sponsor determines after its deliberations that the disclosure of the information is necessary. As a general rule, the information will be disclosed only to the subject in both c ases. The samples derived from the subjects who have provide d consent for the storage and use of samples for pharmacogen etics will be stored for 15 years after the completion of scheduled assessments of the last subject, until the research is considered un necessary, or until the subject withdraws consent for the storage and use of samples, whichever is the earliest. The samples will then be discarded after being treated appropriately so that they cannot be used by other persons for other research. 7.8 Safety As sessments 7.8.1 Clinical Laboratory Evaluation All prespecified laboratory tests , except for the investigative site controls will be performed by a central laboratory. The central laboratory will provide the required materials for processing the samples, and will also provide details of the collection, storage, and shipment of samples as the Laboratory Manual.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and/or unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal labor atory finding), symptom or disease whether or not considered related to the product. An AE i ncludes but is not limited to : • Any clinically significant* worsening of a pre -existing condition ; • A clinically significant* new/worsened laboratory abnormality ; • Any clinically important changes noted during interim or final physical examinations, 12-lead ECGs, X -rays, or any other potential safety assessments, whether or not these procedures are required by the protocol; • An AE occurring from overdose (i.e., a dose higher than that prescribed by a healthcare professional for clinical reasons, or a dose higher than that described on the marketed product label) of an investigational or marketed product, whether accidental or intentional; • An AE occurring f rom abuse (e.g., use for non -clinical reasons) of an investigational or marketed product. *Clinically significant may include, but is not limited to, abnormalities that meet the definition of “serious” (see Section 7.9.5 ), or an event that leads to an intervention such as premature discontinuation of I P or the addition of concomitant/corrective therapy. The collection of AE and SAE information commenc es following the subject’s written consent to participa te in the study. The Investigator will inquire about AEs at all subject visits by asking the subject a non -leading question such as: “How have you been feeling since your last visit?” Al l AEs, whether observed by the Investigator or reported by the subject, must be collected. If a subject experiences an AE or SAE, the subject will receive appropriate treatment and support ive care as necessary, and the Investigator will continue to follow up"

In addition to the Investigator ’s own description of the AEs, each AE will be coded by the Sponsor according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) . 7.9.2 Actions for Subjects If an AE occurs, the Investigator will take appropriate actions as needed, such as providing a proper medical intervention or withdrawal from the study, to ensure the safety of the subject. If it is necessary to identify the treatment (drug) received by the subject, the emergency key code for the su bject will be opened according to the procedure provided in Section 3.4.2.4 . 7.9.3 Urgent Safety Measures In accordance with the principles of ICH E6 -GCP , the Investigator (s) has/have primary responsibility for assuring subject safety throughout the performance of study procedures. An urgent safety measure is defined as any measure which an Investigator may need to implement , which is a deviation from, or a change in, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study subjects without prior IEC/IRB approval/favorable opinion. The Investigator may take appropriate urgent safety measures in order to protect the subjects of the clinical study against any immediate hazards to their health or safety. However, the Investigator must inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of having taken such measures, and the AE resulting in the Urgent Safety Measure must also be reported within 24 hours , following the SAE reporting instruction in Section 7.9.5.1 . 7.9.4 Reporting of Adverse Events The following information will be recorded on the eC RF from the subject’s written consent to participate in the study through the end of the stud y. However, information on AEs leading to discontinue of IP administration will be collected in accordance with Section 4.4.1 . The Sponsor retains the right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing AE(s)/SAE(s) at the end of the study, if judged necessary."

The Investigator will be instructed to closely monitor each subject who experiences a n AE (whether ascribed to the IP or not ) until the outcome of the AE has been determined. The AE must be monitored until the return to the subject’s baseline condition or until clinically satisfactory resolution is achieved (e.g., Grade 1 or stable). 7.9.4.2 Assessment of Relationship to Study Treatmen t The causal relationship to study treatment should be assessed as one of the following: • Related − There is a reasonable causal relationship between the IP administration and the AE. The term “reasonable causal relationship” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship. • Not related − There is not a reasonable causal relationship between t he IP administration and the AE. • Unknown − The causal relationship cannot be determined. 7.9.5 Definition of Serious Adverse Events An SAE is an event defined as below. • Death • Life-threatening − The term “life -threatening” as part of the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of immediate death at the time of the"

Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, or blood dyscrasias that does not result in in -patient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. All AE s, whether non -serious or serious, must b e recorded on the AE page of the eCRF . In addition, any AE that is initially considered serious or becomes serious m ust be reported on the SAE form . The SAE information entered on the eCRF must be consistent with the information entered on the SAE form. 7.9.5.1 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events SAEs require expeditious handling to comply with regulatory requirements. Any SAE occurring in a clinical study and follow -up must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of the Investigator having knowledge of the SAE. The Investigator or other qualified individual at the investigative site must complete the SAE form, sign it, and fax or e -mail it to the Sponsor or designee. If the Investigator is unable to sign the form that is initially submitted within 2 4 hours, the form must be resubmitted with signature within 72 hours. All telephone communication regarding a n SAE must be followed by a written report."

For Japan only, the director of the investigative site w ill consult with the IRB/IEC whether to continue the study at the site. 7.9.6 Definition of Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is herein defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject who received an IP (KHK4083 or placebo). A TEAE can therefore be any unfavorable or unintended signs (including any abnormal laboratory findings), symptoms, or disease that occurred a fter treatment with the IP, whether or not considered related to the IP. A TEAE of which causal relationship to IP is assessed as “related” or “unknown” is defined as a drug -related TEAE. Results of laboratory tests will be checked against the normal ran ge for any deviations (abnormal test results) and any abnormal test results will be compared with those obtained prior to treatment with the IP to determine whether such a change is clinically significant (abnormal change). Any abnormal changes in signs, symptoms, and laboratory data associated with a disease (diagnosis) are regarded as a n AE whose name is consistent with the diagnosis. If an injection reaction occurs, the presenting signs or symptoms of the reaction will be regarded as TEAEs (Section 7.9.8.1 ). Any individual atypical or extremely severe signs or symptoms of the disease will be regarded as independent AEs, separately from the diagnos is. 7.9.7 Definition of Other Significant Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events Other significant TEAEs are defined as any non -serious TEAEs that lead to interruption or discontinuation of IP. 7.9.8 Other Significant Treatment -Emergent Adverse Events Requiring Special Han dling 7.9.8.1 Reporting of Injection -related Reactions The signs and symptoms of an injectio n reaction usually develop shortly after drug injection and generally resolved completely within 24 hours of completion of the injection. The"
87,page_87,"Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006 CONFIDENTIAL -88- presenting sign or symptom should be reported as TEAE term(s) . Acute injection reactions should not be classified a s anaphylaxis unless symptomatic bronchospasm and/or allergy -related edema/angioedema is/are the principal clinical manifestation(s). Refer to Appendix 7 for the clinical criteria for diagnosis of anaphylaxis. The time of onset of the injection reaction or injection site reaction and the time of outcome identification should be entered into the eCRF. 7.9.8.2 Overdose Overdoses should be reported, whether or not the overdose was associated with an AE/SAE, using an SAE form within 24 hours of the Investigator having knowledge of the error. Follow the SAE reporting instructions in Section 7.9.5.1 . 7.9.8.3 Pregnancy Reporting Pregnancy in a female subject or partner of a male subject must be avoided. When a female study subject reports a pregnancy : The subject must be advised by the Investigat or immediately if she suspects she may be pregnant. The Investigator is obligated to immediately report to the Sponsor or designee any pregnancy occurring at any time after the subjec t signs the Informed Consent Form ( ICF) and within 6 months after the last dose of IP. When a male study subject reports a pregnancy of a female partner : The subject must be advised by the Investigator immediately if he suspect s his partner became pregnant after the subject received IP. The Investigator is obligated to immed iately report to the Sponsor or designee any pregnancy occurring at any time after the start of IP administration and within 6 month s after the last dose of IP. When a female study subject reports a pregnancy (or a male study subject reports a pregnancy of a female partner), I P administration should be stopped immediately for the female subject and a pregnancy test should be arranged for the female subject/female partner by the Investigator within seven (7) days of the pregnan cy being reported. In the case of pregnancy, the Investigator must immediately notify the Sponsor of this event and report the pregnancy on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. This includes a study subject as well as the partner of a study subject who becomes pregnant while the subject was receiving IP. If a partner of a male subject becomes pregnant, voluntary written informed consent (a separate ICF will be provided) should be obtained from the partner before conducting necessary"

These include, but are not limited to, hospital records (from which medical history and previous and concurrent medication may be summarized into the eCRF), clinical and office charts, laboratory and pharmacy records, diaries, microfiches, radiographs, and correspondence. All documents will be stored safely in confidential conditions. On all trial -specific documents, other than the signed consent, the subject will be referred to by the subje ct ID, not by name. 8.2 Access to Data By signing this protocol, the Principal Investigator agrees to treat all subject data used and disclosed in connection with this study in accordance with all applicable privacy laws, rules and regulations, including all a pplicable provisions of the Personal Information Protection Law, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and their implementing regulations. During the Sponsor’s monitoring and auditin g, the IRB/IEC’s review, and inspections by domestic and foreign regulatory authorities, the Investigator and the investigative site should allow them direct access to (and copying of, if required) all study -related records including source documents. 8.3 Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) An electronic data capture (EDC) system will be used for collecting data in this study. The EDC system allows each investigative site to enter data in the eCRF, check the input data, and respond to the Sponsor’s inquiries o n the input data, as well as to append electronic signatures. The entered data will be encrypted and transferred to the EDC server via the Internet. This EDC system is designed to meet requirements and guidelines of regulatory"
89,page_89,"Clinical Protocol: 4083 -006 CONFIDENTIAL -90- agencies ( Food and Drug Admin istration [FDA], Code of Federal Regulations [CFR], Title 21, ICH GCP, European Medicines Agency [ EMA ] and Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare [ MHLW ]). The Principal Investigator will fill out an eCRF for each subject and, after ascertaining that all data are accurate and complete, append his/her electronic signature through the EDC system. If an eCRF is filled out by a sub -Investigator or clinical research coordinator, the Princi pal Investigator will check the accuracy and completeness of data prior to appending his/her electronic signature. The Guide for Changes or Corrections to an Electronic Case Report Form, which will be supplied by the Sponsor, must be followed to fill out t he eCRF. In this study, the subject data stored in the EDC server will be regarded as the original eCRF. In this regard, however, once the eCRF data are relocated to a non -rewritable medium (e.g., DVD), or to the electronic document control system, the dat a in such medium/system will be handled as the original. Data should be migrated to the electronic document control system according to prespecified written procedures. The Sponsor will provide a copy of eCRFs and change or correction histories to each investigative site. By signing this protocol, the Principal Investigator agrees to treat all subject data used and disclosed in connection with this study in accordance with all applicable privacy laws, rules, and regulations. In addition for the investigativ e sites in the United States, compliance is required with all applicable provisions of the HIPAA and its implementing regulations. The Principal Investigator , sub -Investigator, or clinical research coordinator will change or correct entries in the eCRF acc ording to the Guide for Changes or Corrections to an Electronic Case Report Form provided by the Sponsor. The change or correction history to the eCRF is automatically recorded on the EDC system. 8.4 Data Collection Using eCOA System An eCOA system will be use d to collect data on EASI, IGA, BSA, SCORAD, pruritus NRS, sleep disturbance NRS , DLQI , and record of emollient use in this study. Since data collected by eCOA system will be regard as source data, paper instruments will not be used and will not be available as source documents.

Data that are entered are transferred to and saved on the eCOA server. In addition, the investigative sites and the Sponsor are allowed to access data th rough the eCOA system on the eCOA server. The eCOA device will be provided to each investigative site. The Investigator will complete EASI, IGA, BSA and SCORAD (A and B) data on the eCOA device at each visit . Subjects will complete pruritus NRS, sleep dist urbance NRS, SCORAD (C) , and DLQI data and record emollient use on the eCOA device at each visit. Written procedures provided by the Sponsor will be followed for data entry into the eCOA system. Data cannot be changed or corrected by subjects once they are saved on the eCOA device or the eCOA server. If any change or correction is required for data saved on the eCOA server, the Principal Investigator , sub -Investigator, or clinical research coordinator will change or correct the relevant data according to wr itten procedures provided by the Sponsor. Histories of changes or corrections on the eCOA system will be obtained by the system. If the eCOA is filled out by a sub -Investigator, the Principal Investigator have to check the accuracy and completeness. Since the eCOA system uses the device, data (including audit trails) saved on the eCOA device will be regarded as source data from data entry into the device until data transfer to the eCOA system, and data on the eCOA server will be regarded as source data after data transfer to the eCOA system. If data (including audit trails) on the eCOA server are migrated to a non-rewritable medium (e.g., CD -R, DVD -R), data on the medium will be regarded as source data and provided to the investigative site. The Sponsor will retain a copy of the source data. 8.4.1 Other Instructions Related to Creation of e COA The following data obtained until Week 16 from subjects who have completed the Week 16 assessment should be immediately entered in to the e COA .

Taking into account the possibility of fluctuation of allocation to each treatment group and subjects who excluded from the primary analysis set , the target number of subjects is determined to be 50 per group as randomized (250 in total). The mean percent changes in EASI score at Week 16 in the KHK4083 group and the placebo group were assumed on the basis of the following study results : • Mean perce nt change in EASI score KHK4083 group : The mean percent change was assumed to be −60% as the mean percent change in EASI score at Week 18 in a Phase 1, open -label, multiple -dose study in subjects with AD (Study 4083 -004) was −62.1% ( last observation carrie r forward [LOCF] ) (as of 07 Feb 2018). Placebo group : The mean percent change was assumed to be −35% since the LS mean of the percent change in EASI score at Week 16 in a Phase 2b clinical study (Study R668 -AD-1021) and Phase 3 clinical studies (SOLO1 and SOLO2) of Dupixent® (dupilumab), which has been approved for the treatment of AD in the United States, Europe, and Japan, was −18.1%, −37.6%, and −30.9%, respectively. • Common standard deviation The common standard deviation was conservatively determined to be 40% on the basis of the maximum standard deviation of the percent change in EASI score among those at each time point in Study 4083 -004 and the standard deviation of it for placebo in a Phase 2b clinical study (Study R668 -AD-1021) of Dupixent® (dupilumab) ."

The statistical test for the primary efficacy endpoint will be conducted only at the first interim analysis as the final result . A closed test procedure will be used to maintain overall type I error rate. 9.4 Early Termination Criteria No criteria for early termination of the study based on statistical evidence will be specified. 9.5 Handling of Missing, Unused, and Abnormal Data Any efficacy data obtain ed after prohibited concomitant medications and therapies will be deemed as missing. Any missing data of the primary endpoint and other continuous endpoints at Week 16 will be imputed by the LOCF method. For dropout subjects (including subjects who receiv e rescue treatment), data at the last assessment point will be defined as data obtained prior to dropout or receiving rescue treatment, while Week 16 data will be used for all other subjects. Subjects with any missing data of categorical endpoints at Week 16 will be counted as non -responder. Sensitivity analysis such as complete case analysis and multiple imputation will be performed to assess the robustness of primary endpoint analysis results. If it is necessary to discuss how to handle data of a particular subject because of an event unexpected at study initiation, handling of such data to be used in the interim analysis (Section 9.8) should be decided before database is frozen (The ""Freeze"" status in EDC will be used) and the other data handling should be decided before database lock. 9.6 Development of Statistical Analysis Plan and Procedure for Reporting Deviations from the Original Statistical Analysis Plan Details of the final analysis plan should be established in a statistical analysis plan that will be finalized before the database is frozen for the primary analysis.

All data for the interim analysis 1 should be frozen (The “Freeze” status in EDC will be used). However, only frozen efficacy data and SDVed safety data will be included in the interim analysis 2 (The “Verified” status in EDC will be used). The primary analysis will be performed in the FAS. The purpose of each interim analysis is as described below. • Interim analysis 1 , Week 16: To confirm a clinically significant difference in efficacy between KHK4083 and placebo and to obtain preliminary information for planning a future study. • Interim anal ysis 2 , Week 36: To obtain preliminary safety and efficacy information of KHK4083 for planning a future study. The interim analysis 1 will be conducted for efficacy endpoints with the FAS after the database is frozen. The interim analysis 2 will be conducted for efficacy and safety (als o including study withdrawal, demography) . The cutoff date will be the date when the data is provided for the analysis after all subjects (excluding early withdrawn subjects) have reached Week 36 visit. However, only efficacy data that have been frozen as of the cutoff date and safety data that have been SDVed as of the cutoff date will be included in the interim analysis 2. The efficacy and safety analyses of the interim analysis 2 will be conducted with the FAS and the safety analysis set, respectively. These analyses will be performed for only pre - specified efficacy and safety analyse s by a separate group which is different fr om the group for final analysis to maintain the blind at the subject level until final database lock. This group will share with the Sponsor only the summarized results (tables or figures) but not individual data listings.

Laboratory tests for evaluating anaphylaxis: At present, there are no sensitive an d specific laboratory tests to confirm the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis. Skin testing and in vitro diagnostic tests to determine the level of specific IgE antibodies directed against the therapeutic protein product, mediator release, or basophil acti vation may be useful for characterizing the underlying pathophysiology and may"
