11,page_11,"RECOVER PI: N. Safdar Version 8 13 Sep 2021 Page 12 of 91 6.0 INTRODUCTION Background Clostridioides difficile (C. difficile ) is a pathogen of major public health importance, especially in individuals with comorbid conditions such as solid organ transplantation (SOT). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate that 165,000 serious C. difficile infections (CDI ) occur in the US annually, at a cost of 1.3 billion dollars, resulting in 28,000 deaths.1,2, 3 National data show that rates of C. difficile infection among hospitalized patients aged ≥65 years have increased 200%. The incidence and adverse outcomes of CD I are greatly amplified in the setting of SOT, due to healthcare exposure, antibiotic use and immunosuppression, all of which a re ubiquitous in SOT recipients4. In recent years, CDI has been increasingly recognized as an important etiology of diarrhea in t his population. An estimated 14-16% of SOT recipients develop CDI, compared with 1 -2% of general non -SOT inpatients. The consequences of CDI in the SOT population are dire: higher rates of fulminant colitis, treatment failure, recurrence and mortality. At UW-Madison, the third largest abdominal transplant program in the country, the recurrence/relapse rate in SOT recipients is 35%; this is largely due to a combination of 1) impaired host immunity and 2) reduced diversity and health of the normal gut microbi ota due to immunosuppression, surgical procedures and devices, repeated exposures to healthcare and antibiotic use. There are currently no effective treatment options to prevent further recurrence of CDI in SOT recipients. Usual care recommended in nationa l guidelines involves oral vancomycin which has low efficacy for prevention of recu rrence with side effects of gut dysbiosis and promotes vancomycin -resistant enterococci. A novel approach that has recently gained attention is restoration of the CDI impaired gut microbiome by instillation of stool from a healthy donor into the intestine of a CDI patient. This treatment, called Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) has been found in non -comparative studies to reduce CDI recurrence dramatically with a reported efficacy of over 95%5-9; its efficacy in SOT recipients has not been studied and cannot be extrapolated from results in the non -SOT population because SOT recipients are a unique study population due to profound immunosuppression, frequent antibio tic use and frequent opportunities for exposure to CDI all of which markedly, repeatedly and persistently disrupt the gut microbiome. Thus, this critical gap in the field needs to be addressed by a trial of FMT in SOT recipients with CDI. The FMT may be delivered via any of several routes; oral, via nasogastric ( NG) tube , enema or colonoscopy. All routes have good efficacy with 80% reported for oral encapsulated product compared with 90% for FMT via enema or colonoscopy.5-9 Rationale There have been recen t published randomized controlled trial s (RCT s) in this area, and thus far, have included non -SOT recipients , performed FMT by way of NG tube rather than oral route with one study reporting an over 85% success rate compared with oral vancomycin taper (30% success rate) in 26 patients with recurrent CDI in the Netherlands.10 While these results are very encouraging, there are a number of reasons why a RCT of FMT in SOT recipients is needed. These include the following:  The RCT had a very small sample size and an unplanned interim analysis resulted in premature termination of the study. This approach was criticized in multiple letters to the editor on the grounds that “small, index trials such as this one are vulnerable to exaggerated treatment effects; ther e may have been inequalities among the three treatment groups in terms of either the number of pretreatment recurrences of C. difficile infection or post -treatment exposure to an antimicrobial agent or proton -pump inhibitor (both of which are well -defined risks for recurrence) .”11  The cure rate in the control group treated with vancomycin was half of that reported in two randomized trials and it was this unexpectedly low cure rate in the control group that produced an inflated estimate of the efficacy of FM T thus leading t o the trial's early termination .  The route of FMT in that study was by nasogastric tube which has a higher risk of side effects than other delivery routes . Given the far fewer side effects expected with oral administration ,"
12,page_12,"RECOVER PI: N. Safdar Version 8 13 Sep 2021 Page 13 of 91 the optimal route of FMT deserves further study. A recent systematic review found equivalent outcomes in case series using FMT by fecal enema or colonoscopy.12 Oral FMT has largely similar efficacy to enema/colonoscopy and high patient acceptance.  The SOT population is at high risk for recurrent CDI due to age and comorbid illnesses and therefore potentially promising therapies such as FMT should be studied in this population .  Follow -up in previous studie s ranged from 1 week to 8 weeks; a standardized approach to follow-up for at least 12 weeks is needed to detect recurrence of CDI .  Given multiple possible causes of diarrhea in the SOT population and a higher prevalence of C. difficile colonization which may be mistakenly diagnosed as CDI, objective blinded assessment of outcomes is essential. The SOT population is also at risk for potential adverse events from FMT by transmission of pathogens and potential precipitation of rejection of the solid organ. Thus, trials of FMT in non -SOT patients cannot be applied to SOT re cipients. An adequat ely powered, multisite, double -blind placebo controlled study of FMT versus oral vancomycin in SOT recipients followed for 30 weeks with outcomes of recurrence and rigor in addressing safety and rejection will address all of the aforementioned shortcomings. A review of www.clinicaltrials.gov yielded 2 7 FMT trials for the treatment of CDI. Only a few are evaluating administration by enema, one in the VA population is assessing FMT via oral route but no trials are assessing safety and efficacy in SOT recipients. Thus, the proposed study will be the first to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FMT for CDI treatment in this patient population ."

Safdar Version 8 13 Sep 2021 Page 14 of 91 7.0 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS Primary Objective The primary o bjective is to compare the effects of FMT and oral vancomycin on the recurrence of CDI in SOT recipients in a randomized controlled trial. Secondary Objective s 7.2.1 Secondary Objective #1 Secondary Objective #1 is to assess Quality of Life (QoL) in SOT recipients with CDI. Patients with recurrent CDI have a markedly compromised quality of life. There is a dearth of data on CDI -related QoL in SOT recipients. A validated instrument, Cdiff -32, will be used to asse ss CDI -related QoL comparing the FMT arm with the oral vancomycin arm.1 7.2.2 Secondary Objective #2 Secondary Objective #2 is to compare the change in gut microbiota using multiple metrics of microbio ta structure and function and to evaluate the association between the change in gut microbiota and recurrence of CDI. The human intestine is colonized by 1013 to 1014 microbes, the vast majority of which belong to the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The composition of the human intestinal microbiota is individual -specific at the species level and is stable over time in healthy adults.2 The composition and activities of the microbiota may be influenced by numerous factors including chronic conditions, age, diet, and antibiotic treatment.3-5 For example, obesity an d inflammatory bowel disease cause significant alterations in the microbiome.6 Similarly, the micro biota of older people displays greater inter -individual variation than that of younger adults (Figure 1).3 Figure 1: Variations in microbial numbers across the length of the gastrointestinal tract by age .2 (a) Variations in microbial numbers across the length of the gastrointestinal tract. (b) Selected features affecting the establishment and maintenance of the microbiota and factors influencing the composition of the microbiota. Micro -organisms are listed where their abundance is related to a particular environmental factor. difficile"
14,page_14,"RECOVER PI: N. Safdar Version 8 13 Sep 2021 Page 15 of 91 The Relationship between CDI and Gut Microbiota Perturbations to the gut microbiota may result in a loss of colonization resistance against C. difficile . Although CDI is commonly associated with antibiotic use, the precise alterations to the microbiota associated with CDI have only recently been examined. For example, Schubert et al. used a variety of antibiotic perturbations to generate a diverse array o f gut microbiota structures, which were then challenged with C. difficile spores. They observed that C. difficile resistance was the result of multiple microbiota members interacting in a context -dependent manner. They found that populations associated wit h the Porphyromonadaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacillus, and Alistipes were protective, while populations associated with Escherichia and Streptococcus had high levels of C. difficile colonization. Their results showed that multiple diverse assemblages ac t in concert to mediate colonization resistance.7 Relationship of CDI with Fecal Cytokines and Serum Antibody Immunity Recent data suggest that outcomes of CDI may be modulated by inflammation, as measured by high levels of fecal cytokines8-11 or fecal lactoferrin12 rather than bacterial burden alone. High IgG serum antibody to toxin A corre lates with milder symptoms of CDI compared to patients with low IgG serum antibody to toxin A.13 In SOT recipients, in particular, hypogammaglobulinemia plays an important role in predisposing to CDI.14-16 CXCL -5/ENA -78,11 and CXCL -8/IL-8 (Quantikine R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), levels of quantitative lactoferrin and serum IgG to toxin A will be measured . Impact of FMT on Gut Microbiome FMT rapidly replenishes the gut microbiota and the recipient microbiota becomes similar to that of the donor.17-19 In particular, FMT is known to alter the recipient microbiota in a number of ways. First, introducing a fecal microb iota from healthy donors that has greater diversity than that of the recipient encourages the establishment of specific taxa within CDI patients and allows for alteration of the patient microbiota that effectively minimizes the effects of CDI. Under this model, specific microbes from the FMT are able to colonize and establish in CDI patients, a concept known as engraftment.20 Importantly, the engraftment of FMT bacteria can further help to reprogram the gut microbiota of CDI patients by allowing for other microbes to colonize the gut from o ther sources (e.g. diet, the environment) and reestablish a highly -diverse healthy gut microbiota. We anticipate that overall gut microbiota health, as determined by diversity metrics, abundance indicators, and the ability of FMT microbes to engraft, will improve in the recipients of FMT. In contrast, patients treated with vancomycin are expected to have long lasting deleterious effects on the normal gut microbiota by limiting the ability of a healthy gut microbiota to establish.21 7.2.3 Secondary Objective #3 Secondary objective #3 is to evaluate the short - and medium -term safety of FMT in SOT patients . The literature supports the safety of FMT in non -SOT recipients delivered by any route; however, the safety of FMT in SOT recipients has not been systematically evaluated, particularly regarding non-infectious outcomes, such as graft function and rejectio n. Our study will provide much needed data on FMT safety in SOT, which will be essential for any therapeutic development for recurrent CDI for this population. 7.2.4 Secondary Objective #4 Secondary objective #4 is to compare the effects of FMT and oral vancomycin on intestinal colonization by multidrug -resistant organisms other than C. difficile in SOT recipients. The normal gut microbiota poses resistance to invasion by pathogenic"
15,page_15,"RECOVER PI: N. Safdar Version 8 13 Sep 2021 Page 16 of 91 organisms. Once the normal gut micro biota is impaired by CDI, surgery, being immunocompromise d, or antibiotics, pathogenic organisms may establish a niche of colonization and later manifest as infection. In the healthcare setting, to which SOT recipients are frequently exposed, these pathogens are invariably multidrug resistant, and include vancomycin -resistant Enterococcus (VRE), fluoroquinolone -resistant Gram - negative bacteria (FRGNB), methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and most recently, the subject of several news r eports and editorials, the dreaded carbapenem -resistant Enterobacteriaceae, which are resistant to virtually all anti - infectives. There is currently no effective way to eradicate gastrointestinal colonization by these multidrug resistant organisms. In SOT recipients, infections caused by these pathogens are associated with major morbidity and mortality.22, 23 Our previous studies on infections in SOT recipients found that 25% had gastrointestinal colonization by VRE, 10% by MRSA, and over 30% by FRGNB.24, 25 We will study colonization of VRE, MRSA, and FRGNB because these are major causes of infections in SOT recipients and are all gut -associated pathogens. The potential benefit of FMT for eradication of non-CDI enteric pathogens has been shown in case reports; our study will provide a robust assessment of the role of FMT for non -CDI multidrug -resistant organisms. There is scant data on outcomes of FMT for CDI in immunocompromised patients 37-39 and data specific to outcomes of F MT for CDI in SOT recipients is limited to two descriptive case series.38, 40 Considerations unique to SOT recipients that may impact the role of FMT in CDI are nutritional status, co -infections, long -term effect of FMT on graft function , and cumulative im munosuppression. Data on these factors will be collected and incorporated in analyses. Primary Outcome Measure The primary outcome measure is recurrence of CDI in SOT recipients with recurrent CDI as a dichotomous variable. Recurrence of CDI is defined as diarrhea (≥3 loose stools that take the shape of the container in a 24 -hour period) for 2 consecutive days with a positive stool test for C. difficile toxin by ELISA within a 60-day period following completion of treatment. Recurrent CDI will be assessed using stool diary and will be monitored by regular phone calls by study staff to determine signs and symptoms of diarrhea during the 24 -week assessment period following enrollment ( 60 days for recurrence and 24 weeks to assess fecal mi crobiome). For subjects with diarrhea, a stool collection to determine C. difficile will be performed as part of standard of care. Secondary Outcome Measures 7.4.1 Secondary Outcome Measure #1 Cdiff32 (Appendix 16.2) , a validated instrument for CDI -related qual ity of life, will be completed at baseline (visit 1), end of study tre atment (visit 3), end of follow -up (visit 7) , and early termination . 7.4.2 Secondary Outcome Measure #2 Change in microbiota will be measured using multiple metrics of microbiota structure and function, as detailed below. Multiplex sequencing of amplicons generated from bacterial 16S rRNA genes Genomic DNA will be extracted from feces using a bead -beating protocol.47 We will generate multiplexed barcoded amplicons from the variable region V 3-V4 of bacterial 16S rRNA genes, and perform 2x250 paired -end sequencing using an Illumina MiSeq, as previously described.48 This technology allows analysis of >300 samples in parallel."
16,page_16,"RECOVER PI: N. Safdar Version 8 13 Sep 2021 Page 17 of 91 Composition and structure of the gut microbiota The composition and structure of the gut microbiota will be determined via 16S rRNA gene analysis. Two analyses will be performed, including an operational taxonomic unit (OTU) analysis, which determines the specific taxa of bacteria present in a microbiota and their rela tive abundances, and a Bray -Curtis dissimilarity analysis,49 which quantifies the compositional dissimilarity between microbial communities in terms of both total diversity and phylogenetic distance and visualized as a principal component analysis ( PCA). An important consideration for the establishment of a healthy gut microbiota is the specific taxa capable of colonizing CDI patients treated with FMT. Therefore, identifying broad groups of bacteria strongly correlated with post -FMT microbiota will help understand which groups colonize the gut of CDI patients. A downstream correlation analysis will be performed on total community structure (Bray -Curtis dissimilarity and relative abundance) and composition using analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) in R. Taken to gether, these analyses will determine which specific OTUs are found to contribute significantly to the overall composition of the microbiota that established in CDI patients after FMT treatment. Metagenomic analysis Shotgun metagenomics will be performed on all fecal DNA samples using a Illumina Hi -Seq 500 (paired -end 2x250). All sequences passing quality control (QC) will be assembled using MEGAHIT 50 to generate contigs and used to predict open reading frames using the program prodigal.51 This library o f genes within a given sample will serve as the basis for all downstream analyses using our metagenomics data, as follows :  Strain -level identification using metagenomics : A key study goal is to determine if specific strains of bacteria are found to coloni ze CDI patients treated with FMT, and thereby minimize the effects of CDI. After FMT, the conventional hypothesis is that bacterial strains present in the FMT are capable of establishing within CDI patients and proliferating (engraftment). However, an alte rnative hypothesis is that the initial engraftment of FMT bacteria allows for the colonization of bacteria from other sources (e.g. environment, diet) and thereby facilitate reprogramming to a healthy gut microbiota. Detecting these fine -scale taxonomic re solutions is not possible with current IIlumina -based 16S rRNA analysis. To address this, metagenomics data will be used to compare against both metagenomics data generated from the FMT itself, and the Human Microbiome Project (HMP, http://hmpdacc.org/), w hich contains over 3,000 genomes of human - associated bacterial strains, including over 800 from the gut alone. F irst, all reads generated from metagenomics sequencing will be compared against a custom database generated from the HMP and FMT samples using the phylogenetic binning program kraken.52 A single -nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis will then be conducted to determine if a given read can be identified as belonging to specific strains/species of gut -associated human microbes. This analysis will result in the following outcomes; (a) which specific strains from the FMT treatment can colonize CDI patients; and (b) what non -FMT related micr obes are capable of colonizing CDI patients.  Function of the gut microbiota : Metagenom ic data also provides the opportunity to determine if specific genes are associated with the successful establishment of a healthy microbiota in CDI patients treated wit h FMT. The predicted ORF translations from the assembled metagenomes will be subjected to functional annotation using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes"
17,page_17,"RECOVER PI: N. Safdar Version 8 13 Sep 2021 Page 18 of 91 and Genomes (KEGG) Automated Annotation Server (KAAS) to annotate each predicted protein according to the KEGG orthology (KO).53 These will be mapped back to their respective metabolic pathways and normalized based on metagenome size. Comparisons between metagenomes will be conducted using chi -square test to determine if a given sample is enriched for genes wi thin a specific pathway. A correlation analysis across samples using a pairwise comparison employing Spearmann’s rank correlation will be conducted to determine which metagenomes are most similar to each other. Further comparisons will be conducted against the FMT -derived metagenomes and those pathways encoded by the HMP. In this way, not only will genes important in colonization be determined, but those derived from the FMT will also be identified as well.  Microbiologic methods: Culture and polymerase cha in reaction ( PCR ) will be used to recover MRSA, VRE and FRGNB. Molecular typing will be employed to show strain relatedness between the isolates at baseline and at the subsequent time points for these organisms and C. difficile .  Stool lactoferrin and cyt okines: For each stool collected, C. difficile will be cultured and PCR will be used for toxin -- quantitation. All isolates will be stored for future strain typing and characterization. Fecal cytokines will be assayed using ELISA. Levels of CXCL -5/ENA -78,24, CXCL -8/IL-8 and quantitative lactoferrin will be compared between treatment arm, with the anticipation that subjects assigned to FMT will have lower levels of cytokines and lactoferrin.  Blood sample analysis for ant ibodies to C. difficile toxin A : Each subject will contribute 2-3 blood samples to examine if there are differences in serum antibody levels between treatment groups . Standard commercially available methods will be used to assess antibody levels (IgG to toxin A).  Correlative outcomes : Diversity of the gut microbiota will be determined using either the reciprocal of Simpson’s index or the Shannon’s index. The reciprocal of Simpson’s index takes into account both the number of species present and the abundance of each species. It has be en used frequently in microbiota studies and is considered a standard measure of microbiota diversity. The Shannon’s index is a complementary index of diversity that considered both the abundance and evenness of species. Metagenomic data as well as cytoki nes, CXCL -5/ENA -78 and CXCL -8/IL-8, levels of quantitative lactoferrin and serum IgG to toxin A will be determined using methods described above. 7.4.3 Secondary Outcome Measure #3 The following variables will be used to assess s hort- and medium -term safety of FMT in SOT patients: Short term safety outcomes include :  bloodstream infection from FMT  immune phenomenon Medium term safety outcomes:  rejections  malignancy"

Stool specimens will be cultured and PCR will be used to recover methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin -resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and fluoroquinolone -resistant Gram -negative bacteria (FRGNB). Molecular typing will also be used to show strain relatedness between the isolates at baseline and at subsequent time points.

Safdar Version 8 13 Sep 2021 Page 20 of 91 8.0 STUDY DESIGN General Design This phase II multi -site randomized, double -blind, doubly placebo -controlled trial will compare the safety and efficacy of fecal microbiota transplant ation (FMT) versus oral vancomycin for prevention of CDI recurrence in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. The study population will consist of 158 adult SOT recipients with at least a first recurrence of CDI. Recurrence of CDI is defined as diarrhea (3 or more loose stools) in a 24 -hour period for 2 consecutive days with a positive stool test for C. difficile toxin within a 180-day period following completion of treatment. Subjects will be enrolled while receiving C. difficile treatment as standard of care, they will be monitored and those that achieve symptomatic response between Day 4 and Day 10 of C. difficile treatment will be randomized to one of two treatment arms as follows:  Arm 1: Single dose of MTP -101-C and vancomycin matching placebo taper .  Arm 2: Single dose of MTP -101-C matching placebo and vancomycin taper . MTP -101-C/Matching Placebo: Subjects will take a single dose at Visit 2. Visit 2 must occur ≤14 days of starting standard of care C.difficile treatment. A single dose consists of 5 capsules, each swallowed individually with water. Vancomycin/ Matching Placebo: Subjects will take one capsule by mouth every 6 hours for a total of 10 days (10 days is inclusive of the 4 -10 days of C. difficile treatment taken prior to Visit 2), after which they will undergo a taper as described in section 10.7.2. Subject accrual will occur over four years a t 5 U.S. sites. Subjects will complete 7 study visits over the cou rse of approximately 30 weeks. Each subject will provide six stool samples and two to four blood specimens. Rationale for Intervention 8.2.1 Rationale for Frozen, Freeze -dried Stool Recent studies have shown that frozen sto ol FMT works as well as fresh stool41, 42 and may be stored for up to 12 months. 8.2.2 Rationale for Universal Donors The choices for a donor for FMT include a household or non -household member or other individual known to and selected by the recipient versus a universal anonymous or non-anonymous donor. There are pros and cons to each of th ese options but the main limitation of the approach where the donor selected by the recipient is logistical. Many of our patients that have undergone FMT have not been able to identify a donor. Even for those that have selected a donor, it has taken severa l weeks to get the donor tested and the procedure scheduled due to issues of transportation, challenges in taking time off from work, etc. Compare this to the universal donor, where testing is performed frequently and stool is collected and frozen until su ch time as it may be used. Recent studies have shown that frozen stool is perfectly adequate for FMT compared with fresh stool. This study will utilize universal donors that are screened and tested. More than one donor may be used for this trial. 8.2.3 Rationale for Encapsulated Fecal Microbiota versus Other FMT Delivery Modes FMT may be delivered by enema, colonoscopy, nasogastric (NG) tube , and oral encapsulation of stool. Encapsulated fecal microbiota was selected for this RCT because ingestion of a single dos e of encapsulated fecal microbiota (~ 5 x 1011 bacteria) is ~ 80% successful in terminating the cycle of recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection"

Safdar Version 8 13 Sep 2021 Page 21 of 91 (rCDI) in patients who have failed multiple attempts to achieve cure with antibiotics alone.29, 30 In addition, encapsulated FMT may be more appealing to potential study participants and less invasive than enema FMT, thereby eliminating possible recruitment challenges that might be encountered in using enema FMT. Administering oral capsules also requires less in-patient care and demand on hospital resources. The encapsulat ed fecal microbiota in this RCT, MTP-101-C, is an investigational drug that has been used since 2015 for treatment of rCDI under the 2013 FDA enforcement discretion policy, which allows FMT for treatment of rCDI that failed standard therapies. Study Risk /Benefit Assessment 8.3.1 Known Potential Risks & Risk Minimization  Vancomycin : Oral vancomycin is the standard of care treatment for recurrent CDI. When administered orally, vancomycin is poorly absorbed, and ingestion does not result in significant levels of drug in the body. The most common side effects associated with oral vancomycin are nausea, stomach pain , and low potassium levels in the blood. Less common side effects include peripheral edema, tiredness, fever, headache, diarrhea, gas, vomit ing, urinary tract infection , and back pain. Rare but serious side effects include kidney failure, decrease in platelets, he aring problems, and vasculitis. Additionally, there is risk of developing antibiotic resistance including vancomycin resistant ent erococcus (VRE) . Risk minimization will include s urveillance for VRE colonization at study visits and communication between subjects and study staff; and specimen collection and analysis.  Vancomycin Matching Placebo : The vancomycin matching placebo capsule s used in this study will be composed of Microcrystalline Cellulose (MCC), NF. MCC is a purified, partially depolymerized cellulose, obtained as a pulp from fibrous plant material . It is widely used in vitamin supplements and tablets , and the likeli hood for adverse reaction is virtually none. There are no obvious foreseeable risks associated with the ingestion of the placebo capsules.  Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT): The most common risk associated with FMT’s is abdominal discomfort (e.g., nausea, bloating, cramping , diarrhea ). There is also a risk of inadvertent transmission of infectious organisms (bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites) or MDRO contained in the stool as well as allergic reactions to constituents (antigens) contained in the donor stool. There is also a risk of transmi ssion of non - infectious disease , e.g., immune dysregulation, energy metabolism dysregulation, malignancy, neurologic disease, and psychiatric disorder. It is unknown if FMT will impact the risk of rejection, orga n function, malignancy, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits. The potential long -term effects of alterations in gut microbiome are unclear. Subjects suspected of developing acute organ rejection while on study will receive a clinical hand -off to the clinical transplant team and will continue to be monitored for the duration of the study.  MTP -101-C: While there have been no adverse events linked to MTP -101-C, a number of risks exist. These include: o Risk of infectious disease transmissi on: FMT has been associated with pathogen transmission, including Shiga -toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC), Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), norovirus. Although the donor material is tested for these pathogens, tests may be false negative. In addition , the current testing may not capture all important pathogens that could be"
21,page_21,"RECOVER PI: N. Safdar Version 8 13 Sep 2021 Page 22 of 91 transmitted. Similarly, although the donor screening and testing protocol is designed to mitigate risk of SARS -CoV-2 transmission, this risk cannot be eliminated with 100% certaint y given the possibility of false negative tests. o Risk of transmitting multi -drug resistant organisms: FMT has been associated with transferring Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) Enterobacteraceae.8 This risk is mitigated by excluding health care work ers who have contact with patients as donors and donor material that tests posititive for ESBL, carbopenem -resistant Enterobacteraceae, vancomycin - resistant Enterococcus, methicillin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus. o Risk of transferring risk of non -infecti ous diseases: Intestinal microbiota is integral to human physiology and its composition can affect the functions of the immune system, energy metabolism, and nervous system. Therefore, there is a theoretical risk that the new intestinal microbiota formed i n part with the donor microbes can increase risks for autoimmunity, allergies, obesity, cancer, neurologic and psychiatric disorders. This risk is mitigated by excluding donors with these conditions. There is also a screening and testing protocol for SARS -CoV-2 in donors. o •It is possible that healthy, asymptomatic stool donors may potentially shed two specific viruses called BK virus and CMV in the stool. There is an increased risk of CMV infection in SOT recipients who have a positive blood test for CMV infection and who receive FMT from stool donors who may have an active CMV infection. To prevent transmission of CMV, we use only donors who have tested negative for CMV as a way to reduce the risk of CMV transmission. For BK, we test the donor urine to ev aluate for BK virus shedding in the urine and if that test was positive, we would not use that donor specimen for FMT. It is important to recognize that tests for CMV and BK have limitations and no test can guarantee 100% accuracy. However, the actions des cribed above can reduce the risk to very low.  MTP -101-C Matching Placebo : The MTP -101-C matching p lacebo is prepared using identical capsules and contain the equivalent amount of trehalose lyoprotectant. The rest of the content is made up with carboxymethylcellulose. There are no known risks for the placebo capsules .  Blood Draw : The risks of drawing blood from a vein include discomfort at the site of puncture; possible bruising and swelling around the puncture site; rarely an infection; and, uncommonly, faintness from the procedure.  Completing Study Visits at Home (at sites where applicable) : When study visits are completed at home, it is possible that any of the risks described above will be treated differently. This is most relevant for the risks associated with study procedures such as completing a blood draw in a non -hospital setting and administration of the FMT capsule. Participants will be asked to consider this when scheduling visits away from a healthcare setting with lesser access to immediate care. 8.3.2 Potential Benefits to the Subjects The potential benefits to research subjects assoc iated with this study include the possible treatment of recurrent CDI."

Safdar Version 8 13 Sep 2021 Page 30 of 91  If possible, do not take proton pump inhibitors or H2 blocker medications that block or diminish stomach acid production for 12 hours prior to MTP -101-C.  No solid food should be present in the stomach at the time of treatment. Solid food should be avoided for at least 4 hours prior to ingestion of capsules and can be resumed 2 hours after ingestion of capsules. Clear liquids are allowed at all times.  Drink at least one glass of water or another clear liquid after taking the capsules.  Remain upright for at least 2 hours after taking the capsules. 10.7.2 Vancomycin/ Matching Placebo Subjects will receive one 125 mg vancomycin capsule or one matching placebo every 6 hours for a total of 10 days (inclusive of the 4 -10 days of C. difficile treatment taken prior to visit 2), followed by 125 mg oral vancomycin or placebo every 12 hours for 7 days, followed by 125 mg oral vancomycin or placebo once daily for 7 days, followed by 125 mg oral vancomycin or placebo every 3 days for 14 days. Randomization and Blinding This wi ll be a randomized, double -blind, doubl y placebo -controlled trial. Eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio stratified by site. Study staff will randomize subjects through a web -based program that assigns the subject an identification number and treatment arm. To maintain the blind, the MTP -101-C matching placebo capsules will mimic the MTP -101-C capsules in appearance, and the vancomycin matching placebo capsules will mimic the vancomycin capsules in appearance. Unblinding Procedure s Unblinding will be done in emergent circumstances where the identity of the study medication needs to be known. All efforts will be made to maintain blinding except in the case of urgent medical necessity. If a subject needs to be unblinded, the study staf f should contact the medical monitor prior to any unblinding procedures and refer to the Ma nual of Procedures for further instruction . Study Intervention Compliance The MTP -101-C/matching placebo capsules will be taken under direct supervision by research staff; thus adherence is not a concern. Several measures will be used to assess oral vancomycin adherence, including:  Drug accountability by study staff at Visit 3.  Subjects will be provided a dose diary to record adm inistration of vancomycin/ matching placebo capsules according to prescribed schedule. For reporting non -compliance, refer to section 14.4 (Protocol Deviations). Concomitant Therapy No other drugs potentially useful in the treatment of CDI should be given during the study unless they are specifically given because of a primary t reatment failure or recurrence. Drugs to control diarrhea (e.g., lope ramide) must also be withheld. Subjects may continue to take transplant -related medications, provided they are not for acute rejection."

Potentially eligible outpatients will be contacted by letter or phone to inform them of the study. Potentially eligible inpatients will be asked by member of their clinical care team if they would be interested in learning about a research study. Outpatient telephone recruitment will be preceded by a recruitment letter, unless a patient is fully eligible to enroll in the study. If a patient is fully eligible, they may be contacted without firs t sending a recruitment letter in order to enroll a patient within the required timeframe. Upon approaching potentially eligible participants, study team may present study advertisements, FMT explanation documents, comics, and information sheet as part of initial discussion. 11.1.2 Informed Consent The informed consent process will be conducted following all federal and institutional regulations relating to informed consent. Participants may also be provided with an information sheet prior to completing the entir e informed consent, as part of the study discussion and to provide them with a succinct description of study activities. Informed consent will be obtained prior to conducting any study related activities. The consent process will occur in-person or via tel ephone . The informed consent process will be performed as follows: 1. The investigator or designee will review the consent form and discuss the study in detail with the potential research subject. 2. The study team member will explain the study, its risks and benefits, and what would be required of the research subject 3. The research subject will be given the opportunity to take the consent form home so that he or she may discuss it with family members, friends, clergy , or others when possible. 4. The subject will have the opportunity to ask questions and have all questions answered by the study coordinator and/or PI. 5. The informed consent document must be signed and dated by the research subject . 6. The study team member will review the informed consent document to en sure that all fields that require a response are complete (i.e. checkbox marked yes or no, etc.) as applicable. 7. The person obtaining consent (POC) must sign and date the informed consent document. 8. The research subject will be given a copy of the signed and dated informed consent. The original signed informed consent is kept in the subject’s research Table 1: Concomitant Medications Not Permitted During the Study Antibiotics/Antivirals# Anti-Diarrheals Other  Nitazoxanide  Atropine/diphenoxylate  Probiotics  ≥80 mg of prednisone or other treatment for acute transplant rejection  Rifampin  Bismuth subsalicylate  Loperamide #Topical antibioti cs/antivirals are allowed."

An abnormal laboratory value will not be assessed as an AE unless that value leads to discontinuation or delay in treatment, dose modification, therapeutic intervention, or is considered by the in vestigator to be a clinically significant change from baseline. These AEs will be entered into the electronic data capture system (EDC). For the purposes of this study, baseline symptoms will be collected prior to the administration of the study intervent ion. Only those symptoms identified as new or worsened compared to the baseline assessment will be recorded as an AE. In addition, only those abnormal laboratory values or physical examination assessments that are considered clinically significant will be recorded in the study documents. Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Definition Per the Code of Federal Regulations 21CFR312.32, an adverse event is considered ""serious"" if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, meets any of the following criteria: ● Result s in death ● Are life -threatening (Refers to an AE in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically, might have caused death if it were more severe.) ● Requires an inpatient hospitali zation or prolongation of an existing hospitalization ● Result s in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. (Disability is defined as a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.) ● Result s in a con genital anomal y/birth defect, con stitute, based upon appropriate medical judgment, an event that may jeopardize the subject’s health and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. ● Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization and that may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one o f the outcomes listed in this definition. (Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse” ) Unanticipated Problem (UP) Definition The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria:  The incidence, experience, or outcome is unexpected given the research procedures described in protocol -related documents (e.g., the study pro tocol, the consent documents, the Investigator’s Drug Brochure) and the characteristics of the subject population being studied. An event may be considered unexpected if it exceeds the nature, severity, or frequency described in the study -related documents , Investigator’s Drug Brochure, product labeling, or package insert."
44,page_44,"RECOVER PI: N. Safdar Version 8 13 Sep 2021 Page 45 of 91  The incidence, experience, or outcome is related or probably related to parti cipation in the research study. Probably related means the incidence, experience, or outcome is more likely than not to be caused by the research study procedures.  The occurrence of the incidence, experience, or outcome suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (physical, psychological, economic, or social) than was previously known or recognized. Classification of an Adverse Event 13.5.1 Severity of Event All AEs will be assessed by the clinician using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5. For AEs not included in the protocol defined grading system, th e following guidelines will be used to describe severity. All grade 4 and 5 AEs must be reported as SAEs.  Mild (grade 1) – Events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject’s daily activities.  Moderate (grade 2) – Events result in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.  Severe (grade 3) – Events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other tre atment. Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening or incapacitating.  Life threatening (grade 4) - The patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. Must be reported as an SAE.  Fatal (grade 5) - The event caused death. Must be reported as an SAE. 13.5.2 Relationship to Study Intervention For all collected AEs, the clinician who examines and evaluates the subject will determine the AE’s causality based on temporal relationship and his/her clinical judgment. The degree of certai nty about causality will be graded using the categories below ; for safety purposes, all AEs considered Definitely, Probably, and Possibly Related will be evaluated as Related.  Definitely Related – Clearly related to the study procedures and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out.  Probably Related – Likely related to the study procedures and the influence of other factors is unlikely.  Possibly Related – Possibly related to the study procedures and there are other factors that could be equally likely.  Unlikely to be related – Doubtfully related to the study procedures and there is another likely cause.  Unrelated – Clearly not related to the study procedures and/or evidence exists that the event is definitely related t o another cause. 13.5.3 Expectedness to Study Intervention The PI will be responsible for determining whether an AE is expected or unexpected in relation to the intervention , based on information in the Investigator’s Brochure, and any prior reports relat ed to the investigational product . For investigational drug and device studies, a n AE will be considered unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously descri bed in the clinical protocol, device manual, investigator’s brochure, investigational drug brochure, the package insert(s), the IRB application, or the informed consent document ."

Safdar Version 8 13 Sep 2021 Page 48 of 91 14.0 STUDY ANALYSIS Statistical Hypothesis This multi -site randomized active -controlled trial in solid organ transplant recipients with at least a first recurrence of CDI is designed to test the hypothesis that FMT will result in less recurrence of CDI compared with oral vancomycin. Primary Efficacy Objective The primary efficacy objective is to compare the effects of FMT and oral vancomycin on the recurrence of CDI in SOT recipients. The primary analysis will be performed according to the intention -to-treat principle. The primary efficacy analysis will be base d on the primary endpoint of CDI recurrence in a 60-day period as a dichotomous variable. The primary comparison between the two treatment arms will be based on a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel chi -square test accounting for stratification by clinical site at a s ignificance level of 0.05. A log binomial model with treatment as model term while adjusting for potential confounders such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidities, exposure to healthcare system, clinical site, and type of transplant organ as per NIH R igor and Reproducibility standards will be used to estimate the relative risk or risk ratio of CDI recurrence with 95% confidence interval. As a secondary analysis, time to recurrence of CDI as time to event data will be compared using log -rank test strati fied by clinical site, and its survival distribution estimated using Kaplan -Meier method.21 A Cox proportional hazards regression model stratified by clinical site will be used to estimate a hazard ratio with 95% confidence interval.57 Primary Safety Obje ctive The primary safety objective is to evaluate the short - and medium -term safety of FMT . The frequency and proportion of short - and medium -term adverse outcomes will be summarized and compared using chi -square test for dichotomous and Jonckheere -Terpstr a test for ordinal data. Secondary Objectives 14.4.1 Secondary Objective 1 The Secondary Objective 1 is to compare the CDI -related qu ality of life of SOT recipients. The CDI -related quality of life (QoL), as measured using Cdiff32, will be compared using longitudinal mixed effects regression model with treatment and time, and treatment by time interaction as model terms while adjus ting for potential confounders. 14.4.2 Secondary Objective 2 The secondary objective 2 is t o compare the change in gut microbiota usin g multiple metrics of microbiota structure and function and 2) to evaluate the association between the change in gut microbiota and recurrence of CDI. The change in diversity indices between the treatment groups will be compared using t -test and analysis of covariance. With the effective sample size of 158, there is 0.80-0.90 power to detect the treatment effect size of 0.51 -0.59, where the treatment effect size is defined as the difference in mean change in diversity indices between the two groups divided by the standard deviation. Cytokines and levels of lactoferrin and serum IgG to toxin A will also be compared between the treatment groups. As a secondary analysis, the longitudinally measured diversity indices will be analyzed using linear mixed models with treatment and time and treatment by time interactions as model terms, while adjusting for potential confounders. Depending on the distribution of the diversity index, a normalizing transformation may be necessary or a nonparametric test such as Wilco xon rank sum test used instead. Association between clinical outcome of CDI recurrence and the change in gut diversity and"
48,page_48,"RECOVER PI: N. Safdar Version 8 13 Sep 2021 Page 49 of 91 microbiota data (both 16S rRNA and metagenomics) will be assessed using the Cox regression model for time to CDI recurrence with trea tment and gut diversity as a time-varying covariate as model terms, while adjusting for potential confounders and using either Bray -Curtis dissimilarity with ANOSIM (16S rRNA) or chi-square test (metagenomics). 14.4.3 Secondary Objective 3 The third secondary obj ective is t o compare the effects of FMT and oral vancomycin on intestinal colonization by multidrug -resistant organisms other than C. difficile in SOT recipients . The primary analysis will compare the prevalence of colonization by each multidrug -resistant organism at 24 weeks between the two groups, using Mantel -Haenszel chi-square test accounting for stratification by clinical site at a significance level of 0.05. The longitudinally measured prevalence of colonization over time will be analyzed using gene ralized linear mixed models with treatment and time, and treatment by time interactions as model terms while adjusting for potential confounders. Although Specific Aim 3 is exploratory, a power of > 0.90 for detecting the prevalence of 0.1 vs 0.3, 0.05 vs 0.25, and 0.05 vs 0.3, is expected for FMT and vancomycin given the sample size of 158. Sample Size Justification The primary endpoint of the study is the recurrence of CDI over 60 days from randomization defined as a dichotomous outcome. With the probab ility of 60-day recurrence denoted by p V and p F, respectively, for the SOC vancomycin (V) arm and the FMT (F) arm, the primary objective of the study will be evaluated by testing the null hypothesis H 0:pV=pF using a two -tailed two-sample test at a significance level α=0.05 against the alternative hypothesis H 1:pV≠pF with power 1 -β=0.9 to detect the decrease in the probability of 60-day recurrence (Δ p=pV-pF) of 0.3. The table below gives the sample size estim ates under different drop -out rates. Assuming a random drop -out rate of 20%, we propose a sample size of 158 based on p V=0.60 -0.70 and pF=0.30 -0.40. If the probability of 60-day recurrence on vancomycin (p V) is <0.60 or >0.70, the study will have a slight ly higher power than 0.90. Subject Population(s) for Analysis The study will enroll 158 subjects who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria over the course of 4 years from five domestic clinical sites. 14.6.1 ITT analysis set The intent -to-treat analysis set will include all randomized participants. 14.6.2 Per-protocol analysis set The per -protocol analysis set will include those who complete the study without major protocol deviations. Major protocol deviations are defined in section 15.4. 14.6.3 Safety analysis set The safety analysis set will include those who receive at least one dose of protocol treatment, either MTP -101-C or oral vancomycin . The efficacy analyses of the trial will be based on the intention -to-treat principle, to include all participants who are randomized as defined in section 14.6.1 . For those subjects who fail to return for evaluation of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints, a method of multiple imputation will be used to impute the missing endpoints26 or"
49,page_49,"RECOVER PI: N. Safdar Version 8 13 Sep 2021 Page 50 of 91 other method for missing data such as principal stratification27 will be used for longitudinal outcomes. See also section 14.9 for handling of missing data. Multiple imputation will follow the standard appr oach: 1) generate complete datasets multiple times using a log -binomial regression model based on the available data; 2) analyze the multiply imputed datasets using the same model; 3) and combined the results for statistical inference. A supportive analysi s of the efficacy endpoints will be performed using the per -protocol analysis set defined in section 14.6.2. All randomized subjects who underwent the protocol treatment of either MTP -101-C or oral vancomycin in the safety analysis set defined in section 14.6.3 will be included in all safety analyses. Statistical Methods Statistical methods will follow the established good statistical practice adopted by a wider community of statisticians in clinical research. All statistical data analyses will be performed using the latest version of SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary NC) an d R (The R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) to provide validation of all analyses as per NIH Rigor and Reproducibility standards. 14.7.1 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Summary tables and graphs of all randomized subjects, subject disposition and reasons f or withdrawal, demographics, and baseline CDI characteristics will be produced. Baseline subject characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation, or median and interquartile range for quantitative measure ments, frequency and proportion for binary or categorical measurements, graphics such as box plots and empirical distribution functions, and assessed for balance between the two dose groups. Appropriate categorical data analysis methods such as chi -squa re test or Jonckeere - Terpstra test will be used to determine if the two treatment groups are balanced and comparable with respect to demographic and baseline characteristics.7 Student’s t - test or Wilcoxon rank -sum tests will be used to determine if the two treatment groups are balanced with respect to baseline continuous covariates. 14.7.2 Efficacy Analysis Primary Efficacy Analysis: The primary analysis will be performed according to the intention -to treat principle. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the primary endpoint of CDI recurrence in a 60-day period as a dichotomous variable. The primary comparison will be based on a Mantel -Haenszel chi -square test accounting for stratification by clinical site at a significance level of 0.05. A log -binomial regression model with treatment as model term while adjusting for potential confounders such as age, sex, comorbidities, exposure to healthcare system, clinical site, and type of transplant organ will be used to estimate the relative risk or risk ratio of CDI recurrence with 95% confidence interval.

A Cox proportional hazards regression model stratified by clinical site will be used to estimate the hazard ratio of recurrence of CDI with 95% confidence interval. Secondary Efficacy Analyses: The CDI -related quality of life (QoL), as measured using Cdiff32, will be compared using longitudinal mixed effects regression model with treatment and time and treatment by time interaction as model terms while adjusting for potential confounders. The prevalence of colonization by each of three multidrug -resistant organisms, VRE, MRSA and FRGNB, at 24 weeks will be compared between the FMT and"

Although this analysis is exploratory, a power of >0.90 for detecting the prevalence of 0.1 vs 0.3, 0.05 vs 0.25, and 0.05 vs 0.3, is expected for FMT and vancomycin, given the sample size of 158. In addition , the prevalence of colonization over time will b e analyzed using generalized linear mixed models with treatment and time and treatment by time interactions as model terms while adjusting for potential confounders. 14.7.3 Safety Analysis The frequency and proportion of short - and medium -term adverse outcomes will be summarized by tables and graphs and compared using chi -square test for dichotomous and Jonckheere -Terpstra test for ordinal data. All inferential statistical tests of safety data will use two -sided statistical tests with a significance level at 0.05 without adjustment for multiplicity. The format and content of all tables and graphs summarizing adverse event, vital signs and laboratory data will adhere to standard good statistical practice. Adverse events will be summarized in multiple tables and graphs by treatment group: • Incidence Table: summary of the incidence of any adverse event, • Serious Adverse Event Table: summary of the incidence of serious adverse events Shifts in laboratory tests are compared between treatments in terms of numbers of subjects showing an increase, decrease, and no change, with respect to the normal range. Changes from baseline to week 24 (calculated as final value minus baseline value) will also be compared between treatments. Inferential analy ses will use Wilcoxon rank -sum tests for continuous variables and chi -square test for categorical variables. All early termination laboratory results will be considered final laboratory results. The percent of subjects showing clinically relevant changes from baseline in laboratory tests will be compared between the two treatment groups. Significant laboratory changes from baseline within treatment group as determined by Student t - test will be listed. 14.7.4 Analysis of Correlative Endpoints The change in diversi ty indices between the treatment groups will be compared using t -test and analysis of covariance. Depending on the distribution of the diversity index, a normalizing transformation may be necessary or a nonparametric test such as Wilcoxon rank sum test use d instead. With the sample size of 158, there is 0.80 - 0.90 power to detect the treatment effect size of 0.51 -0.59, where the treatment effect size is defined as the difference in mean change in diversity indices between the two groups divided by the standa rd deviation. Metagenomic data as well as cytokines, CXCL -5/ENA -78 and CXCL -8/IL-8, levels of quantitative lactoferrin and serum IgG to toxin A will also be compared between the FMT and vancomycin groups using appropriate two -sample tests depending on the statistical distributions for these endpoints. As a secondary analysis, diversity indices over time will be analyzed using linear mixed models with treatment and time and treatment by time interactions as model terms, while adjusting for potential confo unders. Association between clinical outcome of CDI recurrence and the change in gut diversity and microbiota data (both 16S rRNA and metagenomics) will be assessed using the Cox regression model for"

Subgroup Analysis Many baseline characteristics are known to be prog nostic or suspected confounders for the clinical outcomes in the CDI study population, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, status of hospital stay, clinical site, and type of transplant organ. Internal consistency of the primary efficacy analysis will be a ssessed in subgroups defined by these covariates. Heterogeneity will be assessed using interaction tests of treatment by these baseline covariates. Any interaction test resulting in a heterogeneity p -value < 0.15 will be further evaluated for clinical plau sibility. Handling Missing Data Not all subjects will have their stool samples , stool diaries, and QoL data available for analysis, and there will inevitably be missing data. Most methods for handling missing data assume that the data are missing at random, which may not be a valid assumption. Reasons for missing data will be documented and evaluated. If the missing data are extensive, model -based approaches will estimate their effects under various assumptions regarding missingness. For longitudinal data, principal stratification will be used for missing data. Missing data analysis will follow the guideline promulgated in the National Research Council report.28 Exploratory Analysis Marginal analyses , separately, of the clinical outcomes for the primary objective and the change in diversity of the gut microbiota for the secondary objective may not fully capture the effects of FMT treatment. In order to better understand the effects of FMT clinically a nd biologically, joint statistical models for the gut microbiota diversity index at baseline and weeks 1, 4, 8 and 12 and time to recurrence of CDI will be developed. In addition, mediation analysis will be performed to understand whether the effects of FMT is directly on the clinical outcomes without mediation of the gut microbiota diversity or indirectly through modulation of the gut microbiota diversity index instead (Figure 5 ). A publicly available R package, mediation, will be used to perform the req uired mediation analysis ( http://cran.r - roject.org/web/packages/mediation/index.html ).

Frontier Science will be responsible for data management which includes quality control. Relative to quality control, their role will be the following: ● On an ongoing basis, perform QA/QC of submitted clinical and laboratory data, primarily through automated facilities. ● On an ongoing basis, collect data from other instruments and/or other sources collaborating in the study. ● On a daily bas is, monitor computer processes and the database to ensure that all systems are operating correctly. These include data transmission and update operations, and the operations of the system software supporting and managing the study database. ● Monitor the reg istration & randomization system on a daily basis. Monitor accruals and, working with the study statistician, ensure that the study dosing schema is executed properly. ● Provide 24X7 user support for the data management systems. Provide backup to the registr ation & randomization system if there is a failure or if a site is temporarily unable to directly enter a subject. ● Provide training in data management issues and software to staff as needed ● Assist the project statistician with database retrievals and resol ve any data inconsistencies identified by the statistician, querying sites as necessary. ● Produce periodic reports for the PI, study sites, and other study collaborators as requested. Generally, sites will receive operational reports, the PI and designees will receive administrative and site performance reports, while others will receive function - specific reports. ● Generate reports on schedules and as needed; develop additional reports as required. Safety Oversight UW ICTR has established a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to provide a key resource for UW-Madison investigators conducting clinical research. This DMC will provide investigators services to ensure appropriate measures are in place to promote subject safety, research integrity and compliance with federal regulations and local policies for individual clinical research protocols in need of DMC review (as determined by the Principal Investigator (PI), the funding agency, the local Scientific Review Committee, or the local IRB, and for which no DMC exists). For these studies, the UW ICTR DMC will be the primary data and safety advisory group for the Principal Investigator. The DMC is supported in its mission of safety and compliance by experienced ICTR staff to provide administrative assistance, experienced members representing a diversity of backgrounds, skills and knowledge, and the use of the UW Department of Medicine instance Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tool which provides data management functi onality by allowing the development of eCRFs and surveys to support data capture. In providing oversight for the conduct of this study, the ICTR DMC will approximately meet every 12 months during the 5-year study. Additional meetings may be scheduled as de termined by the DMC or as requested by the PI. The DMC members will review protocol -specific reports created by statisticians that serve a non -voting member role on the DMC using data pulled from REDCap. These standard reports will include an overview of s tudy objectives, a review of actual and projected accrual rates, an evaluation of patient demographics for balance of randomization, and a summary of the number and seriousness of adverse events. An interim analysis of study results may be requested, and s ource documents may be reviewed to allow"

Safdar Version 8 13 Sep 2021 Page 55 of 91 the DMC to independently judge whether the overall integrity and conduct of the protocol remain acceptable based on data provided and reported by the Principal Investigator. The DMC will make recommendations to the Principal Investigator that could include actions of continuation, modification, suspension, or termination. Study Monitoring The DMC /Frontier Science monitors will be responsible for implementing and maintaining quality control and quality assurance systems with written standard operating procedures (SOPs) to ensure that trial is conducted and data are generated, documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, accepted standards of Good Clinical Practice ( ICH E6), and all applicable federal, state, provincial, and local laws, rules, and regulations relating to the conduct of the clinical trial. During the trial, the DMC and Frontier Science monitors will utilize on-site, remote and risk - based monitoring to ensure that the protocol and good clinical practices (GCPs) are being followed as described in detail in a separate quality assurance document /monitoring plan . At regular intervals during the clini cal trial, each site will be contacted, through on-site monitoring visits, webinars or telephone calls, by a Frontier Science monitor to review trial progress, Investigator and patient compliance with protocol requirements and any emergent problems. These monitoring visits will include but not be limited to review of the follo wing aspects: patient Informed c onsent for 100% of patients , source data verification, patien t recruitment and follow -up, adverse event documentation and reporting (including timelines s), trial treatment administration, patient co mpliance with the regimens, pharmacy review/ accountability, concomitant therapy use and quality of data. The DCC will determine data accuracy using several statistical -based approaches to identify potential data errors. Source documents, such as documentation of entry criteria, may be queried and reviewed by members of the DMC to identify data irregularities and to confirm that the data recorded on the case report forms is accurate. Any site found to be Unacceptable or Acceptable/Needs Follow -up on monitoring is required to submit a written response and/or corrective action plan to the DMC within 21 days of the receipt of the final monitor findings. Sites that fail to meet the standards for acceptable performance will undergo follow -up action, which will be determined by the severity of the discrepancies and may include repeat on -site monitoring, probation, or suspension. For -cause monitoring will occur if irr egularities are identified, and if necessary will be supplemented by site visits by members of the DMC . The Investigator and the clinical site will allow the monitors and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. The Clinical Site may be subject to review and/or inspection by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and/or to quality assuran ce audits performed by the NIAID or the DMC . It is important that the Investigator(s) and the relevant clinical site personnel be available during the monitoring period and possible audits or inspections, and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. Protocol Deviations A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol or investigational plan requirements. The noncompliance may be either on the part of the subject , the investigator, or the study staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site and"

It is the responsibility of the Principal I nvestigator /site investigator/study staff to use continuous vigilance to identify and report deviations . The Principal Investigator is responsible for a ssessing whether the deviation constitutes noncompliance as defined by the reviewing IRB and if so, reporting it within the required time frame(s). The site investigator is responsible for knowing and adhering to the reviewing IRB requirements. For this t rial, subject non -compliance with MTP -101-C/matching placebo or oral vancomycin /matching placebo (e.g., missed dose) is considered a protocol deviation. Incomplete 7 -Day Post -FMT Stool Diaries are deviations. Incomplete Stool Diaries after the 7 - days post -FMT are not deviations but study staff must reeducate subjects on completion and use of the diary and document reeducation.

No results will be released publicly before completion of the final analysis regarding the primary endpoint of this study without the approval of the NIAID, and the Steering Committee. Any presentation, abstract, or manuscript will be made availab le for review by the principal investigators and the NIAID prior to submission.
