Subsections 2.1 Study Rationale and 2.2 Background are based on the original study design and have been left unchanged for reference. 2.1 Study Rationale The global incidence of lung cancer was 1.8 million in 2012, resulting in an estimated 1.6million deaths [World Health Organization 2012] . In the United States, the 2018 estimated incidence of new diagnoses was 234,030 , and the estimated number of deaths was 154,050 [National Cancer Institute 2018] . NSCLC represents approximately 80% to 85% of all lung cancers. Of patients with NSCLC, tumor histology is approximately 40% to 60% adenocarcinoma, 10% to 15% squamous, 5% neuroendocrine, and the rest, not otherwise specified [Sulpher, J. A., et al 2013] . Approximately 80% of patients with NSCLC have advanced disease not amenable to surgical resection at the time of diagnosis. The 5 -year relative survival for patients with any lung cancer overall and metastatic lung cancer specifically has been reported to be 18.6% and 4.7%, respectively [National Cancer Institute 2018] . Pembrolizumab monotherapy is the current standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) perf ormance status of 0 or 1 and previously untreated advanced or metastatic NSCLC with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1) TPS ≥50% and with no epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK) genomic tumor aberrations. Approxima tely 30% of patients with newly diagnosed, advanced NSCLC highly express PD- L1 with a TPS ≥50% [Reck, M., et al 2016] . KEYNOTE -024, a Phase 3, randomized ,open -label study, compared pembrolizumab monotherapy to standard first -line (1L) platinum -doublet therapy in 305 previously untreated participants with advanced NSCLC and PD -L1 TPS ≥50%. Results from KEYNOTE -024 indicated a significant PFS benefit for pembrolizumab over platinum- doublet therapy, with a hazard r atio (HR) of 0.50 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 -0.68, p <0.001 ). Median PFS was 10.3 months (95% CI, 6.7 months to not reached) with pembrolizumab and 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.2 -6.2months) with platinum -doublet . Additionally, there was an OS benefit ,with an HR of 0.60 (95% CI, 0.41 -0.89; p=0.005) ; median OS was not reached in either treatment arm. The Kaplan -Meier estimates showed 80.2% (95% CI ,72.9%-85.7% ) of participants treated with pembrolizumab and 72.4% (95% CI ,64.5%- 78.9% ) of par ticipants treated with platinum -doublet therapy were alive at 6 months. Furthermore , the ORR was higher in the pembrolizumab arm than in the platinum -doublet arm (44.8% vs 27.8%, respectively) [Reck, M., et al 2016] . The results from KEYNOTE -024 established pembrolizumab as 1L therapy for patients whose tumors have a TPS ≥50% with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. 06GBTC 07YHGD"

Results from KEYNOTE -042 indicated a significant OS benefit for pembrolizumab over platinum -doublet therapy, with a nHR of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.71- 0.93, p =0.0018). Median OS was 16.7 months (95% CI, 13.9- 19.7 months ) with pembrolizumab and 12.1 months (95% CI, 11.3- 13.3 months) with platinum -doublet [Lopes, G., et al 2018] . The Kaplan- Meier estimates showed 39.3% of participants treated with pembrolizumab and 28.0 %of par ticipants treated with platinum- doublet therapy were alive at 6 months (data on file) . While the benefits observed in KEYNOTE -024 (in participants with advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express edPD-L1 TPS ≥50 %) and KEYNOTE -042 (in participants with advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumors express edPD-L1 TPS ≥1%) were substantial for these participant swith NSCLC ,the benefits may be improved further in metastatic NSCLC with PD -L1 TPS ≥1% population, possibly through the combination of pembrolizumab with other therapies such as l envatinib ,a multiple RTKi with a potentially differentiated pr ofile. Lenvatinib has been studied as both monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. As a single agent, a randomized Phase 2 study of lenvatinib versus placebo was conducted in 135 participants with locally advan ced or metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC who had failed to respond to at least 2 systemic anticancer regimens. Eighty -nine participants received 24 mg of lenvatinib QD and 46 received placebo; all participants received best supportive care in addition to study intervention. Median OS was 3 8.4weeks for lenvatinib and 24.1 weeks for placebo, median PFS was 20.9 weeks for lenvatinib and 7.9 weeks for placebo, ORR was 10.1% for lenvatinib and 2.2% for placebo, and the disease control rate ( DCR )was 42.7% for lenvat inib and 19.6% for placebo. Grade 3 and/or 4 AEs occurred in 69% of lenvatinib recipients and 50% of placebo recipients. Grade 3and/or 4 AEs were dyspnea and pneumonia in both treatment groups, as well as hypertension in the lenvatinib group [Havel, L., et al 2014] . Lenvatinib was studied in combination with chemotherapy in a multicenter, open -label , Phase 1,dose-finding study (Study E7080- J081- 110). This study ,conducted in Japanese participants with chemotherapy- naïve NSCLC ,investigat edlenvatinib in combination with carboplatin/paclitaxel to establish themaximum tolerated dose (MTD) . The MTD of lenvatinib was determined to be 4 mg BID after dose -limiting tox icities (DLTs) were experienced at 6 mg BID (febrile neutropenia , gingival infection [n=2]). A dose -expansion cohort was added and 28 participants were dosed in total: 12 in the dose -finding cohort and 16 participants in the dose -expansion cohort. In total , 22 participants were dosed at 4 mg BID with 6 at 6 mg BID. The ORR was 61% (95% CI: 41 %, 79% ) and comprised 1 CR and 16partial responses ( PRs). The median PFS was reported as 9 months. Of the 22 participants in the 4- mg BID dose level, the most frequent ly reported AE swere thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, arthralgia, and alopecia.

No AEs resulting in death were reported [Nishio, M., et al 2013] . The present study is designed to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of combination therapy of lenvatinib and pembrolizumab in adult participants with treatment -naïve, metastatic NSCLC with a TPS ≥1% . The outcomes for participant s evaluated in this study would be further improved if the safety profile of a pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib combination remains acceptable and is shown to improve outcomes compared with pembrolizumab monotherapy; thus, this study could support the regulatory approval of this combination in this pa tient population. 2.2 Background Pembrolizumab is a potent humanized IgG4 mAb with high specificity of binding to the PD-1 receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with PD -L1 and PD -L2. Based on preclinical in vitro data, pembrolizumab has high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity for PD -1. Pembrolizumab has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is in clinical development as an IV immunotherapy for advanced malignancies. Keytruda®(pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients acr oss a number of indications. For more details on specific indications, refer to the pembrolizumab I nvestigator’s Brochure (IB) . Lenvatinib (also known as E7080 or MK -7902) inhibits the kinase activities of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), and VEGFR3 (FLT4). Lenvatinib inhibits other kinases that have been implicated in pathogenic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression in addition to their normal cellular functions, including fibroblast grow th factor (FGF) receptors FGFR1, 2, 3, and 4; platelet - derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), KIT, and RET. Lenvatinib also exhibited antiproliferative activity in cell lines dependent on activated FGFR signaling with a concurrent inhibition of FGF -receptor substrate 2α phosphorylation. Once daily (QD) dosing of lenvatinib combined with pembrolizumab is currently being developed for the treatment of metastatic NSCLC. Refer to the respective I Bs/approved labeling for detailed background information on pembrolizumab and lenvatinib. 2.2.1 Pharmaceutical and Therapeutic Background 2.2.1.1 Lenvatinib Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from a pre-existing vascular network, is essential for tumor growth and metastasis. VEGF and its family of re ceptors (VEG FRs 1-3) play a major role in tumor angiogenesis [Ferrara, N., et al 2003] [Ellis, L. M. 2008] [Tammela, T. 2010] . Accumulated evidence suggests that FGF and its receptor tyrosine kinas e, FGFR ,also play important roles intumor angiogenesis [Cross, M. J. 2001 ] [Lieu, C., et al 2011] [Limaverde -Sousa, G., et al 2014] . Lenvatinib is a potent multiple RTK ithat selectively inhibits VEGF receptors, VEGFR1 (FLT1), VEGFR2 (KDR), VEGFR3 (FLT4), FGFR1 -4, PDGFRα, c-kit, and RET. Among 06GBTC 07YHGD"

Lenvatinib inhibited cell free kinase activities for VEGFR1 -3 and FGFR1 -3 with Ki values around 1 nmol/L, and 8 -22 nmol/L, respectively. In cell -based assays, lenvatinib inhibited VEGF -derived and FGF -derived tube formation of HUVEC with IC 50values of 2.1 and 7.3 nmol/L, respectively. Analysis of the signal transduction molecules revealed that lenvatinib inhibited both the MAPK pathway and the mTOR -S6K-S6 pathway in HUVECs triggered by activated VEGFR and FGFR. Furthermore, lenvatinib (10, 30 mg/kg) significantly inhibited both VEGF -and FGF -driven angiogenesis in a murine in vivo model [Yamamoto, Y., et al 2014] . In vivo, lenvatinib exhibited antitumor activity against various human tumor xenografts in athymic mice including 5 types of thyroid carcinomas (differentiated [papillary and follicular], anaplastic, squamous, and medullary thyroid carcinomas), RCC, HC C, melanoma, gastric cancer, NSCLC, ovarian cancer, Ewing’s sarcoma, and osteosarcoma. In addition, the antitumor activity of lenvatinib in combination with other anticancer agents in several xenograft models was greater than that of lenvatinib or the othe r agents alone. In summary, lenvatinib inhibited VEGF -driven VEGFR2 phosphorylation and suppressed proliferation and tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) models. Antitumor activity of lenvatinib in vivo has been shown in numerous xenograft animals. These results suggest that lenvatinib may be a novel anticancer therapy through inhibition of angiogenesis and may be useful as either monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer drugs. 2.2.1.2 Pembrolizumab Keytruda®(pembrolizumab) is indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of indications. For more details on specific indications, refer to the pembrolizumab IB. 2.2.1.3 Pembrolizumab With Lenvatinib The importance of intact immune surveillance function in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformations has been known for decades [Disis, M. L. 2010] . Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes in cancer tissue and favorable prognosis in various malignancies. In particular, the presence of CD8+ T- cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T- cells/FoxP3+ regulatory T -cells (T -regs) correlates with improved prognosis and long -term survival in solid malignancies, such as ovarian, colorect al, and pancreatic cancer; hepatocellular carcinoma; malignant melanoma; and renal cell carcinoma. Tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes can be expanded ex vivo and reinfused, inducing durable objective tumor responses in cancers such as melanoma [Dudley, M. E., et al 2005] [Hunder, N. N., et al 2008] .In preclinical models, lenvatinib decreased the tumor -associated macrophage (TAM) population, which is known as an immune -regulator in the tumor microenvironment. The decrease in TAM population was accompanied by increases in activated cytotoxic T -cell populations through stimulation of interferon -gamma signaling, resulting in increased immune activation [Kimura, T., et al 2018] . The immune -modulating effect of lenvatinib may result in a potent combination effect with PD -1/L1 signal inhibitors. 06GBTC 07YHGD"

This section has been updated acco rdingly. The original study design was a randomized, double -blind, active -control with placebo, parallel -group, multi sitestudy of IV pembrolizumab and oral lenvatinib in participants with Stage IV NSCLC and PD -L1TPS ≥1% who have not hadpreviously received systemic therapy for metastatic disease, whose tumors express PD -L1 with a TPS ≥1%, and in whom EGFR- , ALK -, or ROS proto -oncogene 1 (ROS1 )-directed therapy is not indicated. Participants were randomized 1:1 to Arm A(pembrolizumab + l envatinib) or Arm B (pembrolizumab + matching placebo). Randomization was stratified by site geographic region (East Asia vs non -East Asia), ECOG PS (0 vs 1), and TPS (1% -49% vs ≥50%). The original study design is depicted in Figure 1 (Initial Treatment P hase) . As of Amendment 007-06,lenvatinib and matching placebo have been removed from the treatment arms (Figure 1) . All participants remain ing on treatment in the study will receive open -label pembrolizumab monotherapy. Treatment with pembrolizumab will continue up to Cycle 35 or until reaching a discontinuation criterion ( defined in Section 7.1) .Imaging will continue until progression by lo cal investigator has been determined. Participants will be evaluated with radiographic imaging to assess response to treatment every 9 weeks from randomization through 54 weeks, then every 12 weeks until PD, initiation of a new anticancer regimen , or completion of 35 cycles . All imaging obtained on study will be submitted to the imaging vendor for BICR, which will assess the images using RECIST 1.1 (see Section 8.2.1.5) for determination of OR, PFS, and DOR. After amendment 007-06, imaging obtained on study will be submitted to the imaging vendor but these will not be assessed, similarly, verification of PD is no longer needed before treatment discontinuation. Treatment -based decisions may use site -assessed iRECIST, as described in Section 8.2.1.6, whic h allows for participants with initial site -assessed PD to continue treatment until PD is confirmed by the site 4 to 8 weeks later .

Lenvatinib (20 mg QD) will be evaluated in combination with the st andard dose of pembrolizumab (200 mg Q3W ). 4.2.1 Rationale for Endpoints 4.2.1.1 Efficacy Endpoints This study will use PFS based on RECIST 1.1 criteria ,adjusted to follow a maximum of 10target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ , as assessed by BICR as a primary endpoint and OR as a secondary efficacy endpoint .PFS and OR are acceptable measure sof clinical benefit for a late-stage study that demonstrates superiority of a new antineoplastic therapy, especially if the magnitude of the effect is large and the therapy has an acceptable risk/benefit profile. The use of BICR and RECIST 1.1 to assess PFS and OR aretypically considered acceptable by regulatory authorities. Images will be read by a central imaging vendor blinded to treatme nt assignment to minimize bias in the response assessments. In addition, the final determination of radiologic progression will be based on the central assessment of progression, rather than a local site investigator/radiology assessment. Real time determi nation of radiologic progression as determined by central review will be communicated to the site. The primary efficacy endpoint OS has been recognized as the gold standard for the demonstration of superiority of a new antineoplastic therapy in randomized clinical studies.

The response patterns seen with such an approach may extend beyond the typical time course of responses seen with cytotoxic agents, and patients treate d with pembrolizumab may manifest a clinical response after an initial increase in tumor burden or even the appearance of new lesions. Thus, standard RECIST 1.1 may not fully capture the treatment benefits from immunotherapeutic agents such as pembrolizuma b. Based on an analysis of participants with melanoma enrolled in KEYNOTE -001 (KN001), 7% of evaluable participants experienced delayed or early tumor pseudo progression. Of note, participants who had PD by RECIST 1.1 but not by the immune -related response criteria [Wolchok, J. D., et al 2009] had longer OS than participants with PD by both criteria [Hodi, F. S., et al 2014] . Additionally, the data suggest that RECIST 1.1 may underestimate the benefit of pembrolizumab in approximately 15% of participants. These findings support the need to apply an adjustment to RECIST 1.1 that takes into account the unique patterns of atypical responses in immunotherapy and enables trea tment beyond initial radiographic progression, if the participant is clinically stable. iRECIST assessment has been developed and published by the RECIST Working Group, with input from leading experts from industry and academia, along with participation fr om the U nited States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [Seymour, L., et al 2017] . The unidimensional measurement of target lesions, qualitative assessment of non target lesions, and response categories are identical to RECIST 1.1, until progression is seen by RECIST 1.1. However, if a participant is clinically stable, additional imaging may be performed to confirm radiographic progression. iRECIST will be used by investigators to assess tumor response and progression and make treatment decisions as well as for exploratory efficacy analyses where specified. 4.2.1.2 Safety Endpoints Safety parameters commonly used for evaluating investigational systemic anticancer treatments are included as safety endpoints including, but not limited to, the incidence of, causality, and outcome of AEs/serious AEs (SAEs); and changes in vital signs and laboratory values.

Symptomatic improvement is considered a clinical benefit and accepted by health authorities. As par t of the analyses for this study, participants will provide information regarding their health- related quality of life (HRQoL) via the following assessment tools: European Organi zation for Research and Treatment of Cance r (EOR TC) QLQ -C30, EORTC QLQ- LC13 , and EuroQoL EQ -5D-5Lquestionnaires . The ePROs are not pure efficacy or safety endpoints because they are affected by both PD and treatment tolerability. 4.2.1.3.1 EORTC QLQ -C30 EORTC QLQ -C30 is the most widely used cancer -specific, HR QoL instrument, which contains 30 items and measures 5 functional dimensions (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), 3 symptom items (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), 6 single items (dyspnea, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial i mpact), and a global health and QoL scale [Aaronson, N. K., et al 1993] . The EORTC QLQ -C30 is a psychometrically and clinically validated instrument appropriate for assessing QoL in oncology studies [Aaronson, N. K., et al 1993] . 4.2.1.3.2 EORTC QLQ -LC13 The EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire and Lung Cancer Module 13 (QLQ -LC13), a supplemental lung cancer -specific module used in combination with QLQ -C30, comprises multi- item a nd single -item measures of lung cancer -associated symptoms (cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and site -specific pain) and treatment -related symptoms (sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy ,and alopecia) [Bergman, B., et al 1994] . It is scored on a 4-point scale (1 =not at all, 2 =a little, 3 =quite a bit, 4 =very much) and has been translated and validated into more than 60 languages. The EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ- LC13 are the most frequently used PRO measures in lung cancer clinical studies. The reliability, validity, and practicality of these instruments have been reported [Bergman, B., et al 1994] [Aaronson, N .

Each dimension is rated on a 5 point scale from 1 (no problem) to 5 (unable to/extreme problem s). The EQ -5D-5Lalso includes a graded (0 to 100) vertical visual analog scale on which the participant rates his or her general state of health at the time of the assessment.

Standard PK parameters of clearance (CL) and volume of distri bution (V) at steady state are planned to be calculated for lenvatinib when coadministered with pembrolizumab , using the accepted mixed- effects modeling approach. PK data from this study may be combined with data from other studies and analy zed using stand ard population PK techniques to further characterize basic PK parameters, evaluate the effect of extrinsic and intrinsic factors in support of the proposed dosing regimen, and evaluate safety in the proposed participant population. 4.2.1.5 Planned Exploratory Biom arker Research Cancer immunotherapies represent an important and novel class of antitumor agents. However, the mechanism of action of these exciting new therapies , including novel combination swith antiangiogenesis therapy, is not completely understood and much remains to be learned regarding how best to leverage these new drugs in treating patients. Thus, to aid future patients, it is important to investigate the determinants of response or resistance to cancer immunotherapy and other treatments administer ed, as well as determinants of AEs in the course of our clinical studies. These efforts may identify novel predictive/PD biomarkers and generate information that may better guide single agent and combination therapy with immuno -oncology drugs. To identify novel biomarkers, biospecimens (ie, blood components, tumor material) will be collected to support analyses of cellular components (eg, protein, deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA ], ribonucleic acid [RNA ], metabolites) and other circulating molecules. Investigatio ns may include but are not limited to: Germline (blood) genetic analyses (eg, SNP analyses, whole exome sequencing, whole genome sequencing) This research may evaluate whether genetic variation within a clinical study population correlates with response to the treatment(s) under evaluation. If genetic variation is found to predict efficacy or AEs, the data might inform optimal use of therapies in the patient population. Furthermore, it is important to evaluate germline DNA variation across the genome in order to interpret tumor -specific DNA mutations. Genetic (DNA) analyses from tumor The application of new technologies, such as next generation sequencing, has provided scientists the opportunity to identify tumor -specific DNA changes (ie, mutations, methylation status, microsatellite instability) contributing towards the development/progression of cancer and/or driving response to therapy. Key molecular changes of interest to immuno- oncology drug development include the mutational burden of tumors and the clonality of T -cells in the tumor microenvironment. Increased mutational burden (sometimes referred to as a ‘hyper - mutated’ state) may generate neo -antigen presentation in the tumor microenvironment. To 06GBTC 07YHGD"

Evaluation of molecular targets and signaling pathways including angiogenesis -or and growth factor related signaling pathways related to pembrolizumab and lenvatinib m ay also be explored. Thus, genome -wide approaches may be used for this effort. Note that in order to understand tumor -specific mutations, it is necessary to compare the tumor genome with the germline genome. Circulating tumor DNA and/or RNA may also be eva luated from blood samples. Tumor and blood RNA analyses Both genome -wide and targeted messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiling and sequencing in tumor tissue and in blood may be performed to define gene signatures that correlate to clinical response to treatment with pembrolizumab or other immunotherapies. Pembrolizumab induce sa response in tumors that likely reflects an inflamed/immune phenotype. Specific immune -related gene sets (ie, those capturing interferon- gamma transcriptional pathways) may be evaluated and new signatures may be identified. Individual genes related to the immune system and growth factor signaling pathways (eg, VEGF and FGF) may also be evaluated. MicroRNA profiling may also be pursued as well as exosomal profiling. Proteomics and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using blood or tumor Tumor and blood samples from this study may undergo proteomic analyses (eg, PD -L1 IHC). PD-L1 protein level in tumor sections, assessed by IHC, has been shown to correlate with response to pembrolizumab in patients with NSCLC, and an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) device has been developed for use with pembrolizumab in NSCLC. Preliminary data indicates that this association may also be true in additional cancer types (ie, triple negative breast cancer, head and neck, and gastric). Additional tumor or blood -derived proteins may also correlate with response to pembrolizumab and lenvatinib combination therapy. Therefore, tumor tissue may be subjected to proteomic analyses using a variety of platforms that could include but are not limited to immunoassays and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. This approach could identify novel protein biomarkers that could aid in patient selection for pembrolizumab (MK -3475) and lenvatinib combination therapy. Other blood- derived biomarkers In addition to expression on the tumor tissue, PD-L1, circulating cytokines and angiogenic factors, and other tumor derived proteins can be shed from tumor and released into the blood. Assays such as enzyme -linked immunoassay (ELISA) measure such proteins in serum . Correlation of expression with respon se to pembrolizumab and lenvatinib combination therapy may identify new approaches for predictive biomarkers in blood, representing a major advance from today’s reliance on assessing tumor biomarkers. This research would serve to develop such assays for fu ture clinical use. Other molecular changes of interest include the subtype of T -cells in the tumor microenvironment.

The study resulted in a significant PFS benefit for pembrolizumab over the SOC at the time (platinum -doublet therapy), with an HR of 0.50 (95% CI ,0.37- 0.68; p<0.001; median PFS ,10.3 months [95% CI ,6.7to not reached] with pembrolizumab and 6.0 months [95% CI ,4.2-6.2months] with platinum -doublet), a s well as an OS benefit with an HR of 0.60 (95% CI 0.41 -0.89; p=0.005; median OS was not reached in either treatment arm) [Reck, M., et al 2016] .The results from KEYNOTE -024 established pembrolizumab as 1L ther apy for patients whose tumors have a TPS ≥50% and in whom EGFR- or ALK-directed therapies are not indicated, and the regimen has received regulatory approval for this use by the FDA and EMA. Additionally , based on results from KEYNOTE -042, pembrolizumab mo notherapy is considered one of the treatment options in treating S tage IV NSCLC in patients with PD- L1 TPS ≥1% with no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. The study resulted in a significant OS benefit for pembrolizumab over the SOC at the time (platinu m-doublet therapy), with an HR of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.71 -0.93; p=0.0018 ). Median OS was 16.7 months (95% CI, 13.9 -19.7 months) with pembrolizumab and 12.1 months (95% CI, 11.3 -13.3 months) with platinum -doublet therapy [Lopes, G., et al 2018] . The use of a lenvatinib matching placebo in combination with pembrolizumab will ensure the objectivity of the local investigators’ treatment decision and AE causality assessments, while still providing participants the SOC treatment . 4.3 Justification for Dose 4.3.1 Maximum Dose/Exposure for This Study NOTE: As of Amendment 007-06, lenvatinib, matching placebo, and Second -course treatment have been removed from the study . This section has been updated accordingly. The maximum dose/exposure of pembrolizumab allowed in this study is 200 mg Q3W up to 35 cycles (approximately 2 years )for the Initial Treatment Phase . 4.3.2 Rationale for Dose Interval and Study Design 4.3.2.1 Lenvatinib Dosing NOTE: As of Amendment 007-06, lenvatinib and matching placebo have been removed from the study . This section is no longer applicable, but has been left unchanged for reference . The dosing regimen of lenvatinib was selected based on the results of the Phase 1b portion of Phase 1b/2 Study 111/KEYNOTE- 146, of which the primary endpoint was to determine the MTD and RP2D for lenvatinib in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W. Thirteen participants (lenvatinib 24 mg/day + pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W: n=3; lenvatinib 20 mg/day + pembrolizumab 200 mg: n=10) were enrolled in tothe Phase 1b portion of the 06GBTC 07YHGD"

Eight of the participants had RCC, 2 had NSCLC, 2 had endometrial cancer , and 1 had melanoma. There were 2 DLTs at the dose of lenvatinib 24 mg/day + pembrolizumab 200 mg IV Q3W (1 participant had Grade 3 arthralgia and another had Grade 3 fatigue); hence, this was defined as the toxic dose. No DLTs were reported in the next 10participants (expansion part), all of whom received the lenvatinib 20 mg/day + pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W dose. Based on review of all of the clinical data from these 13participants, the MTD and RP2D were determined to be 20 mg oflenvatinib daily in combination with a fixed dose of 200 mg of pembrolizumab given Q3W. Based on the promising antitumor efficacy and tolerable safety profile seen in both the endometrial carcinoma and RCC expansion cohorts from Study 111/KEYNOTE -146 [Makker, V., et al 2018] , 2Phase 3 studies have been initiated for both of thes e tumor types, Study E7080- G000 -309/KEYNOTE -775 and Study E7080- G000 - 307/KEYNOTE -581. 4.3.2.2 Pembrolizumab Dosing The r ationale for the use of a fixed dose of pembrolizumab in participant s with solid tumors was based on the following: Similar efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab when dosed at 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10mg/kg Q3W, or 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks in participant s with melanoma and NSCLC Flat exposure -response relationships of pembrolizumab for both efficacy and safety in the dose range of 2 mg/kg Q3W to 10 mg/ kg Q3W The lack of clinically relevant effect of tumor burden or indication on distribution behavior of pembrolizumab (as assessed by the population pharmacokinetics [PopPK] model) Pharmacology data showing full target saturation in both systemic circulati on (inferred from PK data) and tumor (inferred from physiologically based PK analysis) at 200 mg Q3W The choice of pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W as an appropriate fixed dose was based on simulations performed using the PopPK model of pembrolizumab, which show edthe following for a fixed dose of 200 mg Q3W: Provide similar control of PK variability as weight -based dosing, with considerable overlap in the distribution of exposures from the 200 mg Q3W fixed dose and 2mg/kg Q3W dose Maintain individual partic ipant exposures in the exposure range associated with maximal efficacy response that was established in participant s with melanoma and NSCLC 06GBTC 07YHGD"

Additionally, a fixed -dose regimen simplified the dosing regimen to be more convenient for physicians and to reduce the potential for dosing errors. A fixed -dosing scheme also reduced complexity in the logistical chain at treatment facilities and reduced wastage. 4.4 Beginning and End ofStudy Definition The overall study begins when the first participant (or their legally ac ceptable representative) provides documented informed consent. The overall study ends when the last participant completes the last study -related contact , withdraws consent , or is lost to follow -up (ie, the participant is unable to be contacted by the inves tigator). 4.4.1 Clinical Criteria f orEarly Study Termination The clinical study may be terminated early if the extent (incidence and/or severity) of emerging effects/clinical endpoints is such that the risk/benefit ratio to the study population as a whole is unacceptable. In addition, further recruitment in the study or at (a)particular study site(s) may be stopped due to insufficient compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ), and/or other applicable regulatory requirements, procedure -related problems or an unacceptably high number of discontinuations or withdrawals due to administrative reasons. 5 STUDY POPULATION Male and f emale partic ipants with Stage IV NSCLC , who express PD- L1 (TPS ≥1%), have received no systemic anticancer therapy for their S tage IV NSCLC, and are at least 18 years of age will be enrolled in this study.

Lenvatinib may also result in reduced fertility in females of reproductive potential and may result in damage to male reproductive tissues leading to reduced fertility of unknown duration. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of lenvatinib during organogenesis at doses below the recommended human dose resulted in embryotoxicity, fetotoxicity, and teratogenicity in rats and rabbits. Participants should be informed that taking the study intervention may involve unknown risks to the fetus (unborn baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study. To participate in the study, WOCBP must adhere to the contraception requirement (Appendix 5) from the day of study intervention initiation throughout the study period up to 120 days post pembrolizumab or 30 days post lenvatinib/matching placebo, whichever occurs last. Ifthere is any question that a WOCBP will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that participant should not be entered into the stud y. 5.3.3 Pregnancy If a participant inadvertently becomes pregnant while on study intervention, the participant will be immediately discontinued from study intervention. The site will contact the participant at least monthly and document the participant’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated. The outcome of the pregnancy will be reported to the Sponsor without delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is an SAE (eg, death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -threatening complication to the mother or newborn). The study investigator will make every effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Sponsor. If a male participant impregnates a female pa rtner, the study personnel at the site must be informed immediately, and the pregnancy must be reported to the Sponsor and followed as described in Section 8.4.5. 06GBTC 07YHGD"

Study intervention will be administered by the investigator and/or study staff according to the specifications within the Pharmacy Manual. 8.1.8.1 Timing of Dose Administration 8.1.8.1.1 Lenv atinib /Matching Placebo NOTE: As of Amendment 007-06, lenvatinib and matching placebo have been removed from the study .This section is no longer applicable. Lenvatinib/ matching placebo 20 mg (two 10 -mg capsules) QD will be taken orally with water (with or without food) in 21 -day cycles at approximately the same time each day . On Day 1 of each pembrolizumab cycle, len vatinib /matching placebo will be administered 0 -4 hours after pembrolizumab. If a lenvatinib /matching placebo dose is missed and cann ot be taken within 12 hours, then that dose should be skipped and the next dose should be taken at the usual time of administration. For nonvisit days, lenvatinib will be taken at home. When a participant attends a study visit, he or she will bring any unu sed capsule s. 8.1.8.1.2 Pembrolizumab Pembrolizumab will be administered as a 30- minute IV infusion on Day 1 of each 21 -day cycle. Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible. However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of 5minutes and +10 minutes is permitted (ie, infusion time is 30 minutes: 5min/+10 min).

Tumor scans are strongly preferred to be acquired by computed tomography ( CT).For the abdomen and pelvis, contrast -enhanced MRI may be used when CT with iodinated contrast is contraind icated, or when mandated by local practice. The same scan technique regarding modality, ideally the same scanner, and the use of contrast should be used in a participant throughout the study to optimize the reproducibility of the assessment of existing and new tumor burden and improve the accuracy of the assessment of response or progression based on scans .Note: for the purposes of asse ssing tumor scans, the term “investigator” refers to the local investigator at the site and/or the radiological reviewer located at the site or at an offsite facility. MRI is preferred for brain scans ; however, CT scans will be acceptable, if MRI is medically contraindicated. Bone scans may be performed to evaluate bone metastases. Any supplemental scans performed to support a positive or negative bone scan, such as plain X -rays acquired for correlation, should be submitted to the central imaging vendor. Participant eligibility will be dete rmined using local assessment (investigator assessment) based on RECIST 1.1. All schedu led scans for each participant will be submitted to the central imaging vendor. In addition, unscheduled scans to determine PD and scans obtained for other reasons, but demonstrate radiologic progression, are to be submitted to the central imaging vendor. When the i nvestigator identifies disease progression per RECIST 1.1, but el ects to implement iRECIST, the i nvestigator will assess for confirmation of progression by iRECIST at subsequent time points. Images should continue to be submitted to the central imag ing vendor. 8.2.1.1 Initial Tumor Scans Initial tumor scans at screening must be performed within 28 days before the date of randomization. The site study team must review screening scans to confirm the participant has measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 . The screening scans must be submitted to the central imaging vendor for retrospective eligibility review. Tumor scans performed as part of routine clinical management is acceptable for use as screening tumor scans if it is of diagnostic quality and perfo rmed within 28 days before the date of randomization and can be assessed by the central imaging vendor. If brain scan is performed to document the stability of existing metastases, anMRI scan should be used if possible. If MRI is medically contraindicated, CT with contrast is an acceptable alternative. 06GBTC 07YHGD"

Subsequent tumor scans should be performed every 9 weeks (63 days ±7 days) or more frequently if clinically indicated. After 54 weeks, participants who remain on treatment will have scans performed every 12 weeks (84 days ±7 days). Scan timing should follow calendar days and should not be adjusted for delays in cycle starts. Scans should continue to be performed until PD is identified by the i nvestigator (unless the investigator elects to continue treatment and follow iRECIST), the start of new anticancer treatment, withdrawal of consent, death, or any other reason for discontinuation of pembrolizumab listed in Section 7. 1is met, whichever occurs first. All supplemental scans must be submitted to the central imaging vendor. ORshould be confirmed by a repeat scan assessment. Tumor scans to confirm PR or CR should be performed at least 4 weeks after the first indication of a response is observed. Participants will then return to regular scheduled scans , starting with the next scheduled time point. Participants who receive additional scans for confirmation do not need to undergo the next scheduled tumor scan if it is less than 4 weeks later; tumor scans may resume at the subsequent scheduled time point. Note: Response does not need to be verified in real time by the central imaging vendor. Per iRECIST (Section 8.2.1.6), PD should be confirmed by the site 4 to 8 weeks after site - assessed first radiologic evidence of PD in clinically stable participants. Participants who have unconfirmed PDmay continue on treatment at the discretion of the investigator until PD is confirmed by the site, provided they have met the conditions detailed in Section 8.2.1.6. Participants who receive confirmatory scans do not need to undergo the next scheduled tumor scan if it is less than 4 weeks later; tumor scans may resume at the subsequent scheduled time point, if clinically stable. Participants who have confirmed PD by iRECIST, as assessed by the site, will discontinue study intervention . Exceptions are detailed in Section 8.2.1.6. 8.2.1.3 End ofTreatment and Follow- up Tumor Scans For participants who discontinue study intervention, tumor scans should be performed at the time of treatment discontinuation (±4 -week window). If previous scans were obtained within 4 weeks before the date of discontinuation, then scans at treatment discontinuation is not mandatory. For participants who discontinue study intervention because of documented PD , this is the final required tumor scan .

Although RECIST 1.1 references a maximum of 5target lesions in total and 2 per organ, this protocol fo llows a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, if clinically relevant to enable a broader sampling of tumor burden. If disease progression has been assessed by the investigator, the process continues as follows: If participant is clinically stable, continue study intervention per protocol - R esume imaging per protocol schedule ( ≥4 weeks to next scan) - S end scans to imaging vendor - C ontinue local assessment - D o not change investigator assessment of progression - If subsequent scan(s) indicate progression, submit s can(s) to imaging vendor If the participant is not clinically stable, best medical practice is to be applied Before stopping study intervention or imaging or starting new anti cancer therapy in a participant who is clinically stable, communication with the Sponsor is required. Investigator judg ment will determine action Note: the reconsent addendum may be signed any time after investigator -assessed progression is identified, but must be signed prior to starting study intervention . - O btain scans locally per original protocol schedule - D o not send scans to imaging vendor For the purpose of this decision process, lack of clinical stability is defined as: Unacceptable toxicity Clinical signs or symptoms indicating clinically significant disease progression Decline in performance status Rapid disease progression or threat to vital organs or critical anatomical sites (eg, CNS metastasis, respiratory failure due to tumor compression, spinal cord compression) requiring urgent alternative medical intervention 06GBTC 07YHGD"

This section has been updated accordingly. iRECIST is based on RECIST 1.1 but adapted to account for the unique tumor response seen with immunotherapeutic drug s. iRECIST will be used by the i nvestigator to assess tumor response and prog ression and make treatment decisions [Seymour, L., et al 2017] . When clinically stable, participants will continue study intervention beyond RECIST 1.1 PD with continuous assessment of response according to the rules outlined in Appendix 6 . iRECIST reflects some participants can have a transient tumor flare after the start of immunotherapy, then experience subsequent disease response. This data will be captured in the clinical database. Clinical stability is defi ned as the following: Absence of symptoms and signs indicating clinically significant PD No dec line in ECOG performance status No requirements for intensified management, including increased analgesia, radiation, or other palliative care Any participant de emed clinically unstable should be discontinued from study intervention at site-assessed first radiologic evidence of PD and is not required to have repeat tumor scans for confirmation of PD by iRECIST. If the i nvestigator decides to continue treatment, the participant may continue to receive study intervention and the tumor assessment should be repeated 4 to 8 weeks later to confirm PD by iRECIST, per i nvestigator assessment. Scans should continue to be sent in to the central imaging vendor . If repeat scans do not confirm PD per iRECIST, as assessed by the i nvestigator, and the participant continues to be clinically stable, study intervention may continue and follow the regular scan schedule. If PD is confirmed, participants will be discontinued from study intervention. If a participant has iRECIST -confirmed radiographic progression (iCPD) as defined in Appendix 6 , study intervention should be discontinued; however, if the participant is achieving a clinically meaningful benefit, an exception to continue study intervention may be considered following consultation with the Sponsor.

Biopsies obtained before receipt of adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be permitted if recent biopsy is not feasible. All participant s should submit either a newly obtained core or excisional biopsy or archival tissue ( fine-needle aspir ation is not adequate for both archival and new tissue samples) to a central laboratory for characterization of PD -L1 status before treatment allocation. A fine -needle aspirate, frozen sample, plastic -embedded sample, cell block, clot, bone, bone marrow, c ytologic specimen, decalcified or formalin -fixed sample that was frozen at any point will not be acceptable for analysis. Note: Submission of formalin-fixed paraffin- embedded tumor tissue sample blocks are preferred; if submitting unstained slides, the slides should be freshly cut and submitted to the testing laboratory within 14 days from the site slide section date ;otherwise ,a new specimen will be requested. If the sample is determined to be nonevaluable before testing by the central laboratory, a new sample should be submitted if available. The central vendor PD -L1 TPS results of participants will be blinded to the investigator. The Sponsor acknowledges that because of the commercial availability of PD -L1 testing assays, it is possible that the investigator may know a participant’s TPS before screening. This risk is seen as acceptable, as the treatment interventions are hypothesized to provide benefit regardless of TPS. 8.2.2 Patient -reported Outcomes NOTE: As of Amendment 007-06, PROs will no longer be collected.

If a urine test is positive or not evaluable, a serum test will be required. P articipants must be excluded/discontinued from the study in the event of a positive test result. R epeated pregnancy test (such as monthly testing) may be conducted if required by local regulations. 8.4 Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Other Reportable Safety Events The definitions of an AE or SAE, as well as the method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the procedures for complet ing and transmitting AE, SAE, and other reportable safety event reports can be found in Appendix 3 . Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an AE as described in Section 8.4.6 and Appendix 3. Adverse events, SAEs, and other reportable safety events will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's legally authorized representative). The investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and repor ting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE as well as other reportable safety events. Investigators remain responsible for following up AEs , SAEs, and other reportable safety events for outcome according to Section 8.4.3.

Open- ended and nonleading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. 8.4.3 Follow -up of AE, SAE ,and Other Reportable Safety Event Information After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All AEs , SAE s, and other reportable safety events including pregnancy and exposure during breastfeeding, events of clinical interest (ECI s), cancer, and overdose will be followed until resolution, stabilization, until the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow- up (as defined in Section 7.3). In addition, the investigator will make every attempt to follow all nonserious AEs that occur in randomized participants for outcome. Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3. 8.4.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAE Prompt notification (within 24 hours) by the investigator to the Sponsor of SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of parti cipants and the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met. The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The Sponsor will comply w ith country -specific regulatory requirements and global laws and regulations relating to safety reporting to regulatory authorities , IRB/IECs, and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSAR s) according to local regulatory requ irements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAE) from the Sponsor will file it along w ith the I Band will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements . 8.4.5 Pregnancy and Exposure During Breastfeeding Although pregnancy and infant exposure during breastfeeding are not considered AEs, any pregnancy or infant exposure during breastfeeding in a participant (spontaneously reported to the investigator or their designee) that occurs during the study are reportable to the Sponsor. All reported pregnancies must be followed to the completion/termination of the pregnancy. Pregnancy outcomes of spontaneous abortion, missed abortion, benign hydatidiform mole, blighted ovum, fetal death, intrauterine death, miscarriage, and stillbirth must be reported as serious events (Important Medical Events). If the pregnancy continues to term, the outcome (health of infant) must also be reported. 06GBTC 07YHGD"

Specifically, the suspected/actual events covered in this exception include any event that is progression of the cancer under study. The Sponsor will monitor unblinded aggregated efficacy endpoint events and safety data to ensure the safety of the part icipants in the study. 8.4.7 Events of Clinical Interest (ECI s) Selected nonserious and SAEs are also known as ECIs and must be reported to the Sponsor. Events of clinical interest for this study include: 1. An overdose of pembrolizumab , as defined in Section 8. 5, that is not associated with clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results. 2. Any dose over the prescribed dose of lenvatinib associated with an AE. 3. An elevated AST or ALT lab value that is greater than or equal to 3X the upper limit of normal and an elevated total bilirubin lab value that is greater than or equal to 2X the upper limit of normal and, at the same time, an alkaline phosphatase lab value that is less than 2X the upper limit of normal, as determined by way of protocol -specified laboratory testing or unscheduled laboratory testing.* *Note: These criteria are based upon available regulatory guidance documents. The purpose of the criteria is to specify a threshold of abnormal hepatic tests that may require an additional evaluation for an underlying etiology. The study site guidance for assessment and follow- up of these criteria can be found in the Investigator Study File Binder (or equivalent) . 8.5 Treatment of Overdose NOTE: After amendment 007 -06, lenvatinib and matching placebo were discontinued . This section was left unchanged for reference. For purposes of this study, an overdose will be defined as any dose exceeding the prescribed dose as fol lows: Pembrolizumab: ≥5 times the protocol -specified dose . Lenvatinib: any dose above the protocol- specified dose if associated with an adverse event. 06GBTC 07YHGD"

Due to its high degree of plasma protein bi nding, lenvatinib is not expected to be dialyzable. Adverse reactions in patients receiving single doses of lenvatinib as high as 40 mg were similar to those in clinical studies at the recommended dose for differentiated thyroid cancer and RCC. No specifi c information is available on the treatment of overdose of pembrolizumab or lenvatinib .In the event of overdose, the participant should be observed closely for signs of toxicity. Appropriate supportive treatment should be provided if clinically indicated. All reports of pembrolizumab overdose with and without an AE and all reports of lenvatinib overdose with an AE must be reported by the investigator within 24 hours to the Sponsor either by electronic media or paper. Reports of pembrolizumab overdose without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results, should be reported using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” 8.6 Pharmacokinetics As of Protocol Amendment 05, the Sponsor has determined that there is sufficient pembrolizumab/lenvatinib PK data in NSCLC pa rticipants . Consequently, no further PK samples for pembrolizumab and lenvatinib orADA samples for pembrolizumab will be collected. 8.7 Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamic parameters will not be evaluated in this study. 8.8 Planned Genetic Analysis Sample Collection Samples are to be collected for planned analysis of associations between genetic variants in germline/tumor DNA and drug response . If a documented law or regulation prohibits (or local IRB/IEC does not approve) sample collection for these purposes, then such samples are not be collected at the corresponding sites . 8.9 Biomarkers To identify novel biomarkers, the following biospecimens to support exploratory analyses of cellular components (eg, protein, RNA, DNA, metabolites) and other circulating molecules will be collected from all particip ants as specified in the SoA: Blood for genetic analysis Newly obtained/archival tissue sample for PD- L1 analysis Sample collection, storage, and shipment instructions for the exploratory biomarker specimens will be provided in the laboratory manual. 06GBTC 07YHGD"

This futility analysis was requested at a previous eDMC meeting and conducted as described in the sSAP. Based upon thes e data and the recommendation of the eDMC, Amendment 007-06 was implemented to unblind the study and remove lenvatinib and matching placebo from the treatment arms. The prespecified interim and final analyse s of the study described in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) will not be performed. Selected analyses of safety and ePRO endpoints will be performed at the end of the study; there will be no further analyses of efficacy endpoints . This section outlines the statistical analysis strategy and procedures for the study. As of Amendment 007 -06, the study has been u nblinded. Changes made to primary and/or key secondary hypotheses, or the statistical methods related to those hypotheses, that occurred prior to study unblinding were documented in previous protocol amendment (s)(consistent with International Co uncil forHarmoni sation [ICH]of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Guideline E9). Changes to exploratory or other nonconfirmatory analyses made after the protocol has been finalized, but before unblinding/final database lock, will be documented in a supplemental statistical analysis p lan (sSAP) and referenced in the clinical study report (CSR) for the study. Post hoc exploratory analyses will be clearly identified in the CSR. Separate analysis plans (ie, separate documents from the sSAP) will be developed to detail PK and biomarker analyses. The ePRO analysis plan will be included in the sSAP. 9.1 Statistical Analysis Plan Summary Key elements of the SAP are summarized below . The comprehensive plan is provided in Sections 9.2 through 9.12. As of Amendment 007 -06, the prespecified interim and final analyses of the study described in SAP will not be performed.

There will be no further analyses of efficacy endpoints. The primary hypotheses will be evaluated by comparing pembrolizumab + lenvatinib to pembrolizumab + placebo in PFS and OS u sing a stratified log -rank test and in OR Rusing the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method [Miettinen, O. 1985] . The HRwill be estimated using a stratified Cox regression model. Event rates over time will be estimated within each treatment group using the Kaplan - Meier method. The difference in OR Rwill be estimated using the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method with strata weighting by sample size. Statistical Methods for Key Safety AnalysesThe analysis of safety results will follow a tiered approach. The tiers differ with respect to the analyses that will be performed. There are no events of interest that warrant elevation to Tier 1 events in this study. Tier 2 parameters will be assessed via point esti mates with 95% CIs provided for between -group comparisons; only point estimates by treatment group are provided for Tier 3 safety parameters.

The stratification factors used for randomization (see Section 6.3.2) will be applied to all stratified analyses, in particular, the stratified log -rank test, stratified Cox model, and stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method [Miettinen, O. 1985] . Ifthere are small strata, for the purpose of analysis, strata will be combined to ensure sufficient number of participants, responses and events in each stratum. Details regarding the pooling strategy will be prespecif iedin the sSAP prior to the database lock for the first analysis when each applicable endpoint will be analyzed, and decisions regarding the pooling will be based on a blinded review of response and event counts by stratum. The efficacy analyses for OR, D OR and PFS will include responses and documented progression events that occur prior to Second -course treatment.

The strategy to address multiplicity issues with regard to multiple endpoints and interim analyses is described in Section 9.7, Interim Analyses ,and in Section 9.8, Multiplicity. 9.6.1.1 Progression-f ree Survival The nonparametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the PFS curve in each treatment group. The hypotheses of treatment difference in PFS will be tested by the stratified log- rank test . A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling will be used to estimate the magnitude of the treatment difference (ie, HR) between the treatment arms. The HRand its 95% CI from the stratified Cox model with Efron's method of tie handling and with a single treatment covariate will be reported . Since PD is assessed periodically, PD can occur any time in the time interval between the last assessment where PD was not documented and the assessment w hen PD is documented. For the primary analysis, for the participants who have PD, the true date of PDwill be approximated by the date of the first assessment at which PD is objectively documented per RECIST 1.1 by the BICR vendor, regardless of discontinu ation of study drug. Additional analyses will be performed for PFS per iRECIST . To evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint per RECIST 1.1 via BI CR b y the imaging vendor , 1primary and 2sensitivity analyses with a different set of censoring rules will be performed . For the primary analysis, if the events (PD or death) are after more than 1missed disease assessment, the data are censored at the last disease assessment before missing visits. Also, data after new anticancer therapy are censored at t he last disease assessment before the initiation of new anticancer therapy.

Tier 1 Events Safety parameters or AEs of special interest that are identified a priori constitute “Tier 1” safety endpoints that will be subject to inferential testing for statistical significance . AEsthat are immune -mediated or potentially immune -mediated are well documented and will be evaluate d separately; however, these events have been characterized consistently throughout the pembrolizumab clinical development program, and determination of statistical significance is not expected to add value to the safety evaluation. Similarly, the combinat ion of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib has not been associated with any new safety signals. Finally, there are no known AEs associated with participants with NSCLC for which determination of a pvalue is expected to impact the safety assessment. Therefore, th ere are no Tier 1 events for this protocol . Tier 2 Events Tier 2 parameters will be assessed via point estimates with 95% CI sprovided for differences in the proportion of participants with events using the Miettinen and Nurminen method, an unconditional, asymptotic method [Miettinen, O. 1985] . Membership in Tier 2 requires that at least 10% of participants in any treatment group exhibit the event; all other AEs and predefined limits of change will belong to Tier 3. The threshold of at least 10% of participants was chosen for Tier 2 event sbecause the population randomized in this study are in c ritical conditions and usually experience various AEs of similar types regardless of treatment ;events reported less frequent lythan 10% of participants would obscure the assessment of the overall safety profile and add little to the interpretation of pote ntially meaningful treatment differences. In addition, Grade 3 to 5 AE s (≥5% of participants in one of the treatment groups) and SAE s (≥5% of participants in one of the treatment groups) will be considered Tier 2 endpoints. Because many 95% CIs may be provided without adjustment for multiplicity, the CIs should be regarded as a helpful descriptive measure to be used in safety review, not a formal method for assessing the statistical significance of the between -group differences . Tier 3 Events Safety endpoin ts that are not Tier 1 or 2 events are considered Tier 3 events. Only point estimates by treatment group are provided for Tier 3 safety parameters. Continuous Safety Measures For continuous measures such as changes from baseline in laboratory, vital signs, and ECG parameters, summary statistics for baseline, on -treatment, and change from baseline values will be provided by treatment group in table format. 06GBTC 07YHGD"

To assess the treatment effects on the PRO score change from baseline in the PRO endpoints defined in Section 9.4.3, aconstrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) model proposed by Liang and Zeger [Liang, Kung- Yee and Zeger, Scott L. 2000] will be applied, with the PRO score as the response variable, and treatment, time, the treatment by time interaction, and stratification factors used for randomization (SeeSection 6.3.2) as covariates. The treatment difference in terms of least square (LS) mean change from baseline will be estimated from this model together with 95% CI. Model- based LS mean with 95% CI will be provided by treatment group for PRO scores at baseline and post baseline time point . Time toDeterioration (TTD) Forthe TTD endpoints defined in Section 9.4.3, the Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the TTD curve for each treatment group. The estimate of median time to deterioration and its 95% CI will be obtained from the Kaplan- Meier estimates. The treatment difference in TTD will be assessed by the stratified log- rank test.

(MSD) Code of Conduct for Interventional Clinical Trials I. Introduction A.Purpose MSD, through its subsidiaries, conducts clinical trials worldwide to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of our products. As such, we are committed to designing, implementing, conducting, analyzing ,and reporting these trials in compliance with the highest ethical and scientific standards. Protection of participant s inclinical trials is the overriding concern in th e design and conduct of clinical trials . In all cases, M SD clinical trials will be conducted in compliance with local and/or national regulations (including all applicable data protection laws and regulations), and International Council for Harmonisation G ood Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP ),andalsoin accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. B.Scope Highest ethical and scientific standards shall be endorsed for all clinical interventional investigations sp onsored by MSD irrespective of the party (parties) employed for their execution (eg, contract research organizations, collaborative research efforts). This Code is not intended to apply to trials that are observational in nature, or which are retrospective . Further, this Code does not apply to investigator -initiated trials , which are not under the full control of M SD. II.Scientific Issues A.Trial Conduct 1.Trial Design Except for pilot or estimation trials, clinical trial protocols will be hypothesis -driven to assess safety, efficacy, and/or pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic indices of M SD or comparator products. Alternatively, M SDmay conduct outcomes research trials, trials to assess or validate various endpoint measures, or trials to determine patient preferences, etc. The design (ie, participant population, duration, statistical power) must be adequate to address the specific purpose of the trial and shall respect the data protection rights of all participants, trial site staff and, wher e applicable, third parties. Participants must meet protocol entry criteria to be enrolled in the trial. 2.Site Selection MSD selects investigative sites based on medical expertise, access to appropriate participants, adequacy of facilities and staff, pr evious performance in clinical trials, as well as budgetary considerations. Prior to trial initiation, sites are evaluated by M SD personnel to assess the ability to successfully conduct the trial. 3.Site Monitoring/Scientific Integrity Investigative trial sites are monitored to assess compliance with the trial protocol and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). MSD reviews clinical data for accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Data are verified versus source documentation according to standard operating procedures. Per M SD policies and procedures, if 06GBTC 07YHGD"

When necessary, approp riate corrective and/or preventative actions are defined and regulatory authorities and /orethics review committees are notified . B. Publication and Authorship Regardless of trial outcome, MSD commits to publish primary and secondary results of its registe red trials of marketed products in which treatment is assigned, according to the prespecified plans for data analysis. To the extent scientifically appropriate, M SDseeks to publish the results of other analyses it conducts that are important to patients, physicians, and payers. Some early phase or pilot trials are intended to be hypothesis -generating rather than hypothesis testing , in such cases, publication of results may not be appropriate since the trial may be underpowered and the analyses complicated by statistical issues such as multiplicity. MSD’s policy on authorship is consistent with the re commendations published by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE). In summary, authorship should reflect significant contribution to the design and conduct of the trial, performance or interpretation of the analysis, and/or writing of the manuscript. All named authors must be able to defend the trial results and conclusions. M SD funding of a trial will be acknowledged in publications. III.Participant Protection A. Ethics Committee Review (Institutiona lReview Board [ IRB]/Independent Ethics Committee [ IEC]) All clinical trials will be reviewed and approved by an IRB/IEC before being initiated at each site. Significant changes or revisions to the protocol will be approved by the ethics committee prior to implementation, exce pt changes required urgently to protect participant safety that may be enacted in anticipation of ethics committee approval. For each site, the ethics committee and M SDwill approve the participant informed consent form. B. Safety The guiding principle in decision -making in clinical trials is that participant welfare is of primary importance. Potential participants will be informed of the risks and benefits of, as well as alternatives to, trial participation. At a minimum, trial designs will take into accou nt the local stand ard of care. All participation in M SD clinical trials is voluntary. Participants enter the trial only after informed consent is obtained . Participants may withdraw from a n MSD trial at any time, without any influence on their access to, o r receipt of, medical care that may otherwise be available to them. C. Confidentiality MSD is committed to safeguarding participant confidentiality, to the greatest extent possible , as well as all applicable data protection rights. Unless required by law, only the investigator, Sponsor (or individuals acting on behalf of MSD ), ethics committee, and/or regulatory authorities will have access to confidential medical records that might identify the participant by name. D. Genomic Resea rch Genomic research will only be conducted in accordance with a protocol and informed consent authorized by an ethics c ommittee. IV. Financial Considerations A. Payments to Investigators Clinical trials are time -and labor -intensive. It is M SD’s policy to compensate investigators (or the sponsoring institution) in a fair manner for the work performed in support of M SD trials. M SD does not pay incentives to enroll participants in its trials. However, when enrollment is particularly challenging, additional p ayments may be made to compensate for the time spent in extra recruiting efforts. 06GBTC 07YHGD"

However, M SDmay compensate referring physicians for time spent on chart review to identify potentially eligible participants. B.Clinical Research Funding Informed consent forms will disclose that the trial is sponsored by M SDand that the investigator or sponsoring institution is being paid or provided a grant for performing the trial. However, the local ethics committee may wish to alter the wording of the disclosure statement to be consistent with financial practices at that institution. As noted above, all publications resulting from M SD trials will indicate M SD as a source of funding. C. Funding for Travel and Other R equests Funding of travel by investigators and support staff (eg, to scientific meetings, investigator meetings, etc.) will be consistent with local guidelines and practices . V. Investigator Commitment Investigators will be expected to review M SD’s Code of Conduct as an appendix to the trial protocol, and in signing the protocol, agree to support these ethical and scientific standards. 10.1.2 Financial Disclosure Financial Disclosure requirements are outlined in the US Food and Drug Administration Regulations, Financial Disclosure by Clinical Investigators (21 CFR Part 54). It is the Sponsor's responsibility to determine, based on these regulations, whether a request for Financial Disclosure information is required. It is the investigator's/subinvestigator's responsibility to comply with any such request. The investigator/subinvestigator(s) agree, if requested by the Sponsor in accordance with 21 CFR Part 54, to provide his/her financial interests in and/or arrangements with the Sponsor to allow for the submission of complete and accurate certification and disclosure statements. The investigator/subinvestigator(s) further agree to provide this information on a Certification/Disclosure Form, commonly known as a financial disclosure form, provided by the Sponsor. The investigator/subinvestigator(s) also consent to the transmission of this information to the Sponsor in the United States for these purposes. This may involve the transmission of information to countries that do not have laws protecting perso nal data. 10.1.3 Data Protection Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the Sponsor. Any participant records or datasets that are transferred to the Sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant names or any information that would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred. The participant must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by the Sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure must also be explained to the part icipant. The participant must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by Clinical Quality Assurance auditors or other authori zed personnel appointed by the S ponsor, by appropriate IRB/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authori ties. 06GBTC 07YHGD"

Events meeting the AE definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments (eg, E CG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator. Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition inc luding either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study. Note: Congenital disorders (eg, present from birth) not detected or diagnosed prior to study intervention administration do not qualify for reporting as AE . Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a susp ected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication. For all reports of overdose (whether accidental or intentional) with an associated AE, the AE term should reflect the clinical symptoms or abnormal test result. An overdose without any associated clinical symptoms or abnormal laboratory results is reported using the terminology “accidental or intentional overdose without adverse effect.” 06GBTC 07YHGD"

An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a.Results in death b.Is life -threatening The term “ life-threatening ”in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe. c.Requires inpatient hospitalizati on or prolongation of existing hospitalization Hospitalization is defined as an inpatient admission, regardless of length of stay, even if the hospitalization is a precautionary measure for continued observation. (Note: Hospitalization for an elective proc edure to treat a pre -existing condition that has not worsened is not an SAE. A pre -existing condition is a clinical condition that is diagnosed prior to the use of an MSD product and is documented in the participant’s medical history. d.Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncompl icated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, 06GBTC 07YHGD"

These events shoul d usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 10.3.3 Additional Events Reported in the Same Manner as SAE Additional events that require reporting in the same manner as SAE In addition to the above criteria, AEs meeting either of the below criteria, although not serious per ICH definition, are reportable to the Sponsor in the same time frame as SAEs to meet certain local requirements. Therefore, these events are considered serious by the Sponsor for collection purposes. Is a new cancer (that is not a condition of the study) Is associated with an overdose of pembrolizumab 10.3.4 Recording AE and SAE AE and SAE r ecording When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) related to the event. The investigator will record all relevant AE/SAE information on the AE CRFs /worksheets at each examination. It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s medical records to the Sponsor in lieu of completion of the AE CRF page. 06GBTC 07YHGD"

In this case, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be blinde d on the copies of the medical records before submission to the Sponsor. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of i ntensity /toxicity An event is defined as “serious” when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, not when it is rated as severe. 1. The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE (and other reportable safety event) according to the NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4. Any AE that changes CTCAE grade over the course of a given episode will have each change of grade recorded on the AE CRFs /worksheets. −Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. −Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limi ting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (A DL). −Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care ADL. − Grade 4: Lif e threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated . −Grade 5: Death related to AE. Assessment of c ausality 1. Did the Sponsor ’s product cause the AE? 2. The determination of the likelihood that the Sponsor’ s product caused the AE will be provided by an inv estigator who is a qualified physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship between the test product and the AE based upon the available infor mation. 06GBTC 07YHGD"

The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the Sponsor ’s product and the AE; the greater the correlation with the components and their respective elements (in number and/or intensity), the more likely the Sponsor ’s product caused the AE: −Exposure: Is there evidence that the participant was actually exposed to the Sponsor ’s product such as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pill count, diary, etc.), expected pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen? −Time Course: Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the Sponsor ’s product? Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a drug -induced effect (applies to studies with investigational medicinal product)? −Likely Cause: Is the AE not reasonably explained by another etiology such as underlying disease, other drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors. −Dechallenge: Was the Sponsor ’s product discontinued or dose/exposure/frequ ency reduced? −If yes, did the AE resolve or improve? −If yes, this is a positive dechallenge. −If no, this is a negative dechallenge. −(Note: This criterion is not applicable if: (1) the AE resulted in death or permanent disability; (2) the AE resolved/improv ed despite continuation of the Sponsor ’s product; (3) the study is a single -dose drug study; or (4) Sponsor ’s product(s) is/are only used 1 time.) −Rechallenge: Was the participant re -exposed to the Sponsor ’s product in this study? −If yes, did the AE recur or worsen? −If yes, this is a positive rechallenge. −If no, this is a negative rechallenge.

Consistency with study intervention profile: Is the clinical/pathological presen tation of the AE consistent with previous knowledge regarding the Sponsor ’s product or drug class pharmacology or toxicology? 5. The assessment of relationship will be reported on the case report forms/worksheets by an investigator who is a qualified physicia n according to his/her best clinical judgment, including consideration of the above elements. 6. Use the following scale of criteria as guidance (not all criteria must be present to be indicative of a Sponsor ’s product relationship). −Yes, there is a reasonabl e possibility of Sponsor ’s product relationship: −There is evidence of exposure to the Sponsor ’s product. The temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to the administration of the Sponsor ’s product is reasonable. The AE is more likely explained by the Spo nsor’s product than by another cause. −No, there is not a reasonable possibility of Sponsor's product relationship: −Participant did not receive the Sponsor ’s product OR temporal sequence of the AE onset relative to administration of the Sponsor ’s product is not reasonable OR the AE is more likely explained by another cause than the Sponsor’s product. (Also entered for a participant with overdose without an associated AE.) 7. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has re viewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. 8. There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor. However, it is very important that the investi gator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the Sponsor. 9. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment. 10. The causality assessment is 1 of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. 11. For studies in which multiple agents are administered as part of a combination regimen, the investigator may attri bute each AE causality to the combination regimen or to a single agent of the combination. In general, causality attribution should be assigned to the combination regimen (ie, to all agents in the regimen). However, 06GBTC 07YHGD"

If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered. Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP: Premenarchal Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: −Documented hysterectomy −Documented bilateral salpingectomy − Documented bilateral oophorectomy For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above (eg, Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry. Note: Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview. Postmenopausal female −A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months withou t an alternative medical cause. ◦A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or HRT . However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirmation with 2 FSH measurements in the po stmenopausal range is required. ◦Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the nonhormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study.

The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. a.Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants of clini cal studies. b.If locally required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, acceptable contraceptive implants are limited to those which inhibit ovulation. c.IUS is a progestin -releasing IUD. Note: The following are not acceptable methods of contraception: −Periodic abstinence (calendar, sympt othermal, post ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lacta tional amenorrhea method (LAM) . −Male condom with cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide . −Male and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure with friction). 10.5.3 Pregnancy Testing WOCBP should only be included after a negative highly sensitive urine or serum pregnancy test.

Assessment at Screening and Before RECIST 1.1 Progression Until radiographic PD based on RECIST 1.1, there is no distinct iRECIST assessment. Assessment and Decision at RECIST 1.1 Progression For participants who show radiological PD by RECIST 1.1, the investigator will decide whether to continue a participant on study intervention until repeat scans areobtained, as describ ed in Section 8.2.1.6 . Tumor flare may manifest as any factor causing radiographic progression per RECIST 1.1, including: Increase in the sum of diameters of target lesion(s) identified at baseline to ≥20% and ≥5mm from nadir Note: the iRECIST publication uses the terminology “sum of measurements,” but “sum of diameters” will be used in this protocol, consistent with the original RECIST 1.1 terminology Unequivocal progression of nontarget lesion(s) identified at baseline Development of new lesion(s) iRECIST defines new response categories, including iUPD (unconfirmed PD) and iCPD (confirmed PD ). For purposes of iRECIST assessment, the first visit showing PDaccording to RECIST 1.1 will be assigned a visit (overall) response of iUPD, regardless of which factors caused the PD . At this visit, target and nontarget lesions identified at baseline by RECIST 1.1 will be assessed as usual. New lesions will be classified as measurable or nonmeasurable, using the same size thresholds and rules as for baseline lesion assessment in RECIST 1.1. From measurable new lesions, up to 5 lesions total (up to 2 per organ), may be selected as New Lesions –Target. The sum of diameters of these les ions will be calculated and kept distinct from the sum of diameters for tar get lesions at baseline. All other new lesions will be followed qualitatively as New Lesions – Nontarget. 06GBTC 07YHGD"

Confirmation of P D PD is considered confirmed, and the overall response will be iCPD, if ANY of the following occur: Any of the factors that were the basis for the iUPD at the previous visit show worsening −For target lesions, worsening is a further increase in the sum of diameters of ≥5mm, compared with any prior iUPD time point −For nontarget le sions, worsening is any significant growth in lesions overall, compared with a prior iUPD time point; this does not have to meet the “unequivocal” standard of RECIST 1.1 −For new lesions, worsening is any of these: ◦An increase in the new lesion sum of diame ters by ≥5 mm from a prior iUPD time point ◦Visible growth of new nontarget lesions ◦The appearance of additional new lesions Any new factor appears that would have triggered PD by RECIST 1.1 Persistent iUPD PDis considered not confirmed, and the overall response remains iUPD, if: None of the PD -confirming factors identified above occurs AND The target lesion sum of diameters (initial target lesions) remains above the initial PD threshold (by RECIST 1.1) Additional imaging for confirmation should be scheduled 4 to 8 weeks from the imaging on which iUPD is seen. This may correspond to the next visit in the original visit schedule. The assessment of the subsequent confirmation imaging proceeds in an identical manner, with possible outcomes of iCPD, iUPD, and iSD , iPR , and iCR. 06GBTC 07YHGD"

The response is classified as iSD or iPR (depending on the sum of diameters of the target lesions) or iCR if all lesions resolve. In this case, the initial iUPD is considered to be pseudo progression, and the level of suspicion for progression is “reset .” This means that the next visit that shows radiographic progression, whenever it occurs, is again classified as iUPD by iRECIST, and the confirmation process is repeated before a response of iCPD can be assigned. Manageme nt Following the Confirmatory Imaging If repeat imaging does not confirm PD per iRECIST, as assessed by the investigator, and the participant continues to be clinically stable, study intervention may continue and follow the regular imaging schedule. If PD is confirmed, participants will be discontinued from study intervention. NOTE: If a participant has confirmed radiographic progression (iCPD) as defined above, but the participant is achieving a clinically meaningful benefit, an exception to continue study intervention may be considered following consultation with the Sponsor. In this case, if study intervention is continued, tumor imaging should continue to be performed following the intervals as outlined in the SoA (Section 1.3). Detection of Progression at Visits After Pseudo- progression Resolves After resolution of pseudo progression (ie, achievement of iSD, iPR , iCR, iUPD is indicated by any of the following events): Target lesions −Sum of diameters reaches the PD threshold ( ≥20% and ≥5 mm increase from nadir) either for the first time, or after resolution of previous pseudo progression. The nadir is always the smallest sum of diameters seen during the entire trial, either before or after an instance of pseudo progression. Nontarget lesions −If nontarget lesi ons have never shown unequivocal PD, their doing so for the first time results in iUPD. 06GBTC 07YHGD"

P Dmust be confirmed before iCPD can occur. The decision process is identical to the iUPD confirmation process for the initial PD, with 1exception: if new lesions occurred at a prior instance of iUPD, and at the confirmatory imaging the burden of new lesions has increased from its smallest value (for new target lesions, the sum of diameters is ≥5 mm increased from its nadir), then iUPD cannot resolve to iSD or iPR. It will remain iUPD until either a de crease in the new lesion burden allows resolution to iSD or iPR, or until a confirmatory factor causes iCPD.

In addition to the information presented in the protocol SAP ,which provides the principal features of confirmatory analyses for this trial, this supplemental SAP provides additional statistical analysis details/data derivations and documents modifications or additions to the analysis plan that are not “principal” in nature and result from information that was not available at the time of protocol finalization. 2. SUMMARY OF CHANGES As the observed PFS event number at the July 2021 DMC was more than the expected PFS event number at the IA (PFS final analysis), t hesSAP wasamended to update the non-binding futility criteria for July 2021 DMC in Appendix 5.1 .. 3. ANALYTICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL DETAILS FOR GLOBAL STUDY 3.1. Statistical Analysis Plan Summary Study Design Overview Phase 3 study of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib vs pembrolizumab plus placebo for 1L treatment of metastatic NSCLC in participants whose tumors express PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) Treatment Assignment Approximately 620 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio between 2treatment arms: (1) pembrolizumab + lenvatinib and (2) pembrolizumab + placebo. Stratification factors are as follows: Geographic region (East Asia vs non -East Asia) ECOG PS (0 vs 1) TPS (1% -49% vs ≥50%) Analysis Populations Efficacy: Intention to Treat (ITT) Safety: All Par ticipants as Treated (APaT) PRO: Full Analysis Set (FAS) Primary Endpoints PFS per RECIST 1.1 based on BICR OS Secondary Endpoints OR perRECIST 1.1 based on BICR Safety and tolerability Mean change from baseline in Global health status/ QoL, cough, chest pain, dyspnea andphysical functioning scores Time to True Deterioration (TTD) in global health status/QoL, cough, chest pain, dyspnea, physical functioning , and composite endpoint (combination of cough, chest pain, or dyspnea items ) Statistical Methods for Key Efficacy AnalysesThe primary hypotheses will be evaluated by comparing pembrolizumab + lenvatinib to pembrolizumab + placebo in PFS and OS using a stratified log -rank test and in ORR using the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method [Miettinen, O. 1985]. The HR will be estimated using a stratified Cox regression model. Event rates over time will be estimated within each treatment group using the Kaplan- Meier method. The difference in ORR will be estimated using the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method with strata weighting by sample size. 06F9HF 07YK6K"

The HR will be estimated using a stratified Cox regression model. Event rates over time will be estimated within each treatment group using the Kaplan- Meier meth od. The difference in ORR will be estimated using the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method with strata weighting by sample size. Interim Analyses One interim analys isand onefinal analysis are planned for this study. Results will be reviewed by an external Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ). Details are provided in Section 9.7. Interim analysis (IA): to be performed after ~ 416PFS events are observed and ~8.8 months after last participant randomized oPrimary purpose: final PFS analysis and interim OS analysis Final analysis: to be performed after ~388 deaths are observed and ~18.5 months after last participant randomized oPrimary purpose: final OS analysis Note that for the IA and the FA, if the events accrue slower than expected such that the targeted number of events cannot be reached in the anticipated timeframe, the Sponsor may conduct the analysis with an additional 2 months and 7months of follow -upfor the IA and FA respectively, or the specifie d number of events is observed, whichever occurs first. Multiplicity The overall T ype I error rate over the multiple endpoints will be strongly controlled at 2.5% ( 1-sided). A 0.5 5% (1-sided ) will be initially allocated to test PFS and 1.9 5% (1-sided) all ocated to test OS. The graphical approach of Maurer and Bretz [Maurer, W., et al 2011] will be applied to reallocate αamong the hypotheses for OR R, PFS, and OS. Lan -DeMets [Lan, K. K. G. and DeMets, D. L. 1983] and O’Brien -Fleming [O'Brien, P. C. and Flem ing, T. R. 1979] group sequential methods will be used to allocate αamong the interim and final analys is for the OS endpoint. Sample Size and Power The planned sample size is approximately 620participants. For PFS, based on 416 events, the study has 86.5% power to detect a HR of 0.7 (pembrolizumab + lenvatinib vs pembrolizumab +placebo) at α=0.5 5% (1-sided). For OS, based on 388events, the study has 90% power to detect a HR of 0.7 1(pembroli zumab + lenvatinib vs pembrolizumab +placebo) at α=1.95% (1 -sided). China Extension Study China participants randomized during the global study phase will be included in all global study analyses (efficacy and safety). China participants randomized durin g the China extension phase will be excluded from all global study analyses. China participants randomized during global and extension phases will both be included in the China- specific analyses . 3.2. Responsibility for Analyses/In -house Blinding The statistical analysis of the data obtained from this study will be the responsibility of the Clinical Biostatistics department of the Sponsor. This study will be conducted as a double -blind study under in -house blinding procedures. The official, final database will not be unblinded until medical/scientific review has been performed, protocol deviations have been identified, and data have been declared final and complete. 06F9HF 07YK6K"

Blinding issues related to the planned interim analyses are described in Section 3.7. 3.3.Hypotheses/Estimation Objectives and hypotheses of the study are stated in Section 3 of the study protocol . 3.4.Analysis Endpoints Efficacy and safety endpoints that will be evaluated for within- and between- treatment differences are listed below. 3.4.1. Efficacy Endpoints 3.4.1.1. Primary Endpoints PFS:the time from randomization to the first documented PD per RECIST 1.1 , adjusted to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, based on BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. See Section 9.6.1 for th e definition of censoring. OS:the time from randomization to death due to any cause. 3.4.1.2.

Safety Endpoints Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including AEs, SAEs, fatal AEs, laboratory tests, and vital signs. Furthermore, specific events will be collected and designated as ECIs as described in Section 8.4.7 of the study protocol. 3.4.3. Patient -reported Outcome Endpoints Secondary Mean change from baseline in EORTC QLQ -C30 global health status/QoL (items 29- 30), physical functioning (items 1 -5), and dyspnea scores (item 8) , and EORTC QLQ -LC13 cough (item 31) and chest pain (item 40) scores. 06F9HF 07YK6K"

TTD in the individual scores specified above is defined as the time to first onset of ≥ 10 (out of 100) point deterioration from baseline in a given scale/ subscale/ite m and confirmed by a second adjacent ≥10 point deterioration from baseline. TTD in the composite endpoint is defined as the time to first onset of a ≥10 point deterioration (i.e., increase in score) from baseline in any one of the 3 lung cancer symptom scale items (EORTC -QLQ- C30 [dyspnea] and EORTC -QLQ- LC13 [cough and chest pain]) with confirmation by the subsequent visit of a ≥10 point deterioration (i.e., increase in score) from baseline in the same scale as the first onset .Changes from baseline in EO RTC QLQ - C30 scores will also be interpreted according to recent subscale -specific guidelines, which indicate that clinically meaningful differences vary by scale (Cocks et al., 2012) Exploratory Change from baseline in the a dditional scales of the EORTC Q LQ-C30, EORTC QLQ -LC13, and EuroQoL EQ- 5D visual analogue scale (VAS) scores.

Efficacy Analysis Populations The analyses of the primary efficacy endpoints are based on the ITTpopulation. All randomized participants will be included in this population. Participants will be analyzed in the treatment group to which they we re randomized. Based on actual enrollment, all participants who were randomized on or prior to January 28, 2021 will be included in the ITT population of the global study. All participants who failed screening in addition to all randomized participants on or prior to January 28, 2021will be included in the screening population. Details on the approach to handling missing data are provided in Section 3.6. 3.5.2. Safety Analysis Populations Safety a nalyses will be conducted in the APaT population, which consists of all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of s tudy intervention . Participants will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the study intervention they actually received for the analysis of safety data using the APaT population. This will be the treatment group to which they are randomized, except for p articipants who take incorrect study intervention for the entire treatment period; such participants will be included in the treatment group corresponding to the study intervention actually received. Any participant who receives the incorrect study intervention for 1cycle, but receives the randomized treatment for all other cycles, will be analy zed according to the randomized treatment group ,and a narrative will be provided for any events that occur during the cycle for which the participant is incorrectly dosed. 06F9HF 07YK6K"
169,page_169,"MK-7902 PAGE 12 PROTOCOL NO.007 -05(E7080 -G000 -314) Supplemental SAP 15JUL2021 At least 1 laboratory, vital sign, or ECG measurement obtained subsequent to at least 1 dose of study intervention is required for inclusion in the analysis of the respective safety parameter. To assess change from baseline, a baseline measurement is also required. 3.5.3. Patient -reported Outcome Analysis Population The PRO analyses are based on the PRO Full Analysis Set (PRO FAS) population, defined as all randomized participants who have at least one PRO assessment available and have received at least one dose of the study intervention. Participants will be analyzed in the treatment group to which they we re randomized. 3.5.4. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Population The population of PK analysis set includes all the participant s who have received at least 1 dose of study intervention with documented dosing history in the lenvatinib + pembrolizumab arm and have measurable plasma levels of lenvatinib or serum levels of pembrolizumab. 3.6.Statistical Methods 3.6.1. Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses This section describes the statistical methods that address the primary and secondary efficacy objectives. Efficacy results that will be deemed to be statistically significant after considera tion of the Type I error control strategy are described in Section 3.8. Nominal pvalues will be computed for other efficacy analyses, but should be interpreted with caution because of potential issues of multiplicity. The stratification factors used for randomization (see Section 6.3.2 in the protocol ) will be applied to all stratified analyses, in particular, the stratified log -rank test, stratified Cox model, and stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method [Miettinen , O. 1985] . The efficacy analyses for OR, DOR and PFS will include responses and documented progression events that occur prior to second course treatment. A summary of the primary analysis strategy for the key efficacy endpoints is provided in Table 1. 06F9HF 07YK6K"
170,page_170,"MK-7902 PAGE 13 PROTOCOL NO.007 -05(E7080 -G000 -314) Supplemental SAP 15JUL2021 Table 1 Analysis Methods for Key Efficacy Endpoints Endpoint/Variable Statistical MethodAnalysis PopulationMissing Data Approach Primary Analyses: PFS (RECIST 1.1) by BICRTesting: stratified log -rank test Estimation: Stratified Cox model with Efron's tie -handling method ITT Censored according to rules in Table 2 OS Testing: stratified log -rank test Estimation: Stratified Cox model with Efron's tie -handling methodITT Censored at last known alive date Secondary Analyses: ORR (RECIST 1.1) by BICRTesting and estimation: stratified Miettinen and Nurminen methodITTParticipants with missing data are considered nonresponders Abbreviations: BICR = blinded independent central review; ITT = intention -to-treat; ORR = objective response rate; OS =overall survival; PFS = progression -free survival; RECIST 1.1 = Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. The strategy to address multiplicity issues with regard to multiple endpoints and interim analyses is described in Section 3.7, Interim Analyses, and in Section 3.8, Multiplicity. 3.6.1.1. Progression- free Survival The nonparametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the PFS curve in each treatment group. The hypotheses of treatment difference in PFS will be tested by the stratified log-rank test. A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's meth od of tie handling will be used to estimate the magnitude of the treatment difference (ie, HR) between the treatment arms. The HR and its 95% CI from the stratified Cox model with Efron's method of tie handling and with a single treatment covariate will be reported. The stratification factors used for randomization (Section 6.3.2 in the protocol ) will be applied to both the stratified log- rank test and the stratified Cox model. Since PD is assessed periodically, PD can occur any time in the time interval be tween the last assessment where PD was not documented and the assessment when PD is documented. For the primary analysis, for the participants who have PD, the true date of PD will be approximated by the date of the first assessment at which PD is objectively documented per RECIST 1.1 by the BICR vendor, regardless of discontinuation of study drug. To evaluate the robustness of the PFS endpoint per RECIST 1.1 via BI CR by the imaging vendor, 1 primary and 2 sensitivity analyses with a different set of censo ring rules will be performed. For the primary analysis, if the events (PD or death) are immediately after more than 1consecutive missed disease assessment, the data are censored at the last disease assessment before missing visits. Also data after new anticancer therapy are censored at the last disease assessment before the initiation of new anticancer therapy. The first sensitivity analysis follows ITT principles (ie, PDs/deaths are counted as events regardless of missed study visits or initiation 06F9HF 07YK6K"
171,page_171,"MK-7902 PAGE 14 PROTOCOL NO.007 -05(E7080 -G000 -314) Supplemental SAP 15JUL2021 of new anticancer therapy). The second sensitivity analysis considers discontinuation of treatment or initiation of an anticancer treatme nt subsequent to discontinuation of study- specified treatments, whichever occurs later, to be a PD event for participants without documented PD or death. If a participant meets multiple criteria for censoring, the censoring criterion that occurs earliest w ill be applied. The censoring rules for primary and sensitivity analyses are summarized in Table 2 .

In case the proportional hazards assumption is not valid, R estricted M ean Survival Time (RMST) method may be conducted for PFS to account for the possible non -proportional hazards effect as a sensitivity analysis. 3.6.1.2. Overall Survival The nonparametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the survival curves. The treatment difference in survival will be assessed by the strati fied log- rank test (based on the stratification factors defined in Section 6.3.2 inthe protocol ). A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling will be used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference (ie, the HR). The HR and its 95% CI from the stratified Cox model with a single treatment covariate will be reported.

Participants without documented death at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last known contact. In case the proportional hazards assumption is not valid, RMST method may be conducted for OSto account for the possible non -proportional hazards effect as a sensitivity analysis. 3.6.1.3. Objective Response Rate The stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method will be used for comparison of ORR between the treatment groups. The difference in ORR and its 95% CI from the stratified Miettinen a nd Nurminen method with strata weighting by sample size will be provided. The same stratification factors used for randomization (Section 6.3.2 in the protocol ) will be used as stratification factors in the analysis. 3.6.1.4. Duration of Response For subjects who demonstrate CR or PR, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. The nonparametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to summarize the DOR. The median and range of DOR wil l be provided. Censoring rules for DOR are summarized in Table 3.

Note: A missed disease assessment includes any assessment that is not obtained or is considered inadequate for evaluation of response. 3.6.2. Statistical Methods for Safety Analyses Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including AEs, laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG measurements. 06F9HF 07YK6K"
173,page_173,"MK-7902 PAGE 16 PROTOCOL NO.007 -05(E7080 -G000 -314) Supplemental SAP 15JUL2021 The analysis of safety results will follow a tiered approach ( Table 4). The tiers differ with respect to the analyses that will be performed. AEs (specific terms as well as system organ class terms) and events that meet predefined limits of change in laboratory, vital signs, and ECG parameters are either prespecified as “Tier 1” endpoints or will be classified as belonging to “Tier 2” or “Tier 3,” based on observed proportions of particip ants with an event. Tier 1 Events Safety parameters or AEs of special interest that are identified a priori constitute “Tier 1” safety endpoints that will be subject to inferential testing for statistical significance. AEs that are immune -mediated or potentially immune -mediated are well documented and will be evaluated separately; however, these events have been characterized consistently throughout the pembrolizumab clinical development program, and determination of statistical significance is not expected to add value to the safety evaluation. Similarly, the combination of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib has not been associated with any new safety signals. Finally, there are no known AEs associated with participants with NSCLC for which determination of a p value is expected to impact the safety assessment. Therefore, there are no Tier 1 events for this protocol. Tier 2 Events Tier 2 parameters will be assessed via point estimates with 95% CIs provided for differences in the proportion of participants with eve nts using the Miettinen and Nurminen method, an unconditional, asymptotic method [Miettinen, O. 1985]. Membership in Tier 2 requires that at least 10% of participants in any treatment group exhibit the event; all other AEs and predefined limits of change w ill belong to Tier 3. The threshold of at least 10% of participants was chosen for Tier 2 events because the population randomized in this study are in critical conditions and usually experience various AEs of similar types regardless of treatment; events reported less frequently than 10% of participants would obscure the assessment of the overall safety profile and add little to the interpretation of potentially meaningful treatment differences. In addition, Grade 3 to 5 AEs ( ≥5% of parti cipants in one of the treatment groups) and SAEs ( ≥5% of participants in one of the treatment groups) will be considered Tier 2 endpoints .Because many 95% CIs may be provided without adjustment for multiplicity, the CIs should be regarded as a helpful des criptive measure to be used in safety review, not a formal method for assessing the statistical significance of the between -group differences. Tier 3 Events Safety endpoints that are not Tier 1 or 2 events are considered Tier 3 events. Only point estimates by treatment group are provided for Tier 3 safety parameters. Continuous Safety Measures For continuous measures such as changes from baseline in laboratory, vital signs, and ECG parameters, summary statistics for baseline, on -treatment, and change from baseline values will be provided by treatment group in table format. 06F9HF 07YK6K"

Statistical Methods for Patient -reported Outcome Analyses 3.6.3.1. Scoring Algorithm EORTC QLQ -C30: For each scale or item, a linear transformation will be applied to standardize the score as between 0 and 100, according to the corresponding scoring standard. For global health status/quality of life and all functional scales, a higher val ue indicates a better level of function; for symptom scales and items, a higher value indicates increased severity of symptoms. 06F9HF 07YK6K"
175,page_175,"MK-7902 PAGE 18 PROTOCOL NO.007 -05(E7080 -G000 -314) Supplemental SAP 15JUL2021 The scoring method for each subscale of the EORTC -QLQ- C30 will be performed according to the scoring manual (Scott, et al., 2008) . According to the EORTC QLQ- C30 manual, if items   ,   , ⋯ ,    are included in a scale, the linear transformation procedure is as follows: 1. Compute the raw score:   = (   +    + ⋯ +    )/  2. Linear transformation to obtain the score S: Functional scales:   =  1 −            ×100 Symptom scales/items:   =  1 −            ×100 Global health status/quality of life scale:   =  1 −            ×100 The range is defined as the difference betwee n the maximum possible value of RS and the minimum possible value for RS . If more than half of the items within one scale are missing, then the scale is considered missing; otherwise, the score will be calculated as the average score of those available ite ms. EORTC QLQ -LC13: The lung cancer questionnaire module is a validated self -reported PRO questionnaire that is intended to be used in conjunction with the QLQ -C30 and includes 13 questions that share the four level ordinal response with the QLQ -C30 and c an be summarized and scored as described above (1= “not at all”; 2= “a little”; 3= “quite a bit”; 4= “very much”). The LC13 comprises both multi- item and single -item measures of lung cancer -associated symptoms (i.e. coughing, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and pain) and treatment related symptoms (i.e., sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia). A linear transformation will be applied to standardize the scores between 0 ( least severe symptom ) and 100 ( most severe symptom ) as described above for the EORTC QLQ -C30 symptom scales/items scoring. EQ-5D: The EQ -5D-5L is primarily designed for self -completion and consists of 2 parts: a descriptive system and the VAS. The EQ -5D-5L descriptive system includes 5 dimensions: mobility, self - care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The 5 dimensions each have 5 levels: no problems, slight, moderate, severe problems, and extreme problems. The responses patterns on the 5 dimensions are scored using country -specific population we ights to provide an aggregate index score anchored at 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health); depending on the algorithm used some states may be considered worse than death . The EQ -5D VAS records the respondent’s self -rated health on a vertical, visual analogue scale (0-100), with endpoints labeled ‘the best health you can imagine’ and ‘the worst health you can 06F9HF 07YK6K"

For the EQ -5D VAS scale, A ≥7-point change from baseline in VAS is considered to be a MID (Packard et al., 2007 ). 3.6.3.2. PRO Compliance Summary Completion and compliance of EORTC QLQ -C30, EORTC -QLQ- LC13, and EQ -5D by visit and by treatment will be described. Numbers and percentages of complete and missing data at each visit will be summarized. An instrument is considered complete if at least one valid score is available according to the missing item rules outlined in the scoring manual for each respective instrument. Completion rate of treated participants (CR- T) at a specific time point is defined as the number of treated participants who complete at least one item over the number of treated participants in the PRO analysis population. CR-T =                                 ℎ                                                                ℎ                          The completion rate is expected to shrink in the later visit during study period due to the participants who discontinued early. Therefore, another measurement, compliance ra te of eligible participants (CR -E) will also be employed as the support for completion rate. CR -E is defined as the number of treated participants who complete at least one item over number of eligible participants who are expected to complete the PRO assessment, not including the participants missing by design such as death, discontinuation, translation not available. CR-E =                                 ℎ                                                              ℎ                           The reasons of non -completion and non- compliance will be provided in supplementary table: –Completed as scheduled –Not completed as scheduled –Off-study: not scheduled to be completed.

Mean Change from Baseline The time point for the mean change from baseline analysis will be defined as the latest time point at which approximately CR-T ≥ 60% and CR-E ≥ 80% based on blinded data review prior to the database lock for any PRO analysis. To assess the treatment effect s on the PRO score change from baseline in the global health status/QoL ,physical functioning and dyspnea scores of the EORTC QLQ -C30 and the cough and chest pain scores of the EORTC QLQ- LC13 scales a constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) model proposed by Liang and Zeger [Liang, K- Y. and Zeger, S. L. 2000] will be applied, with the PRO score as the response variable, and treatment, time, the treatment by time interaction, and stratification f actors used for randomization (See Section 6.3.2 in the protocol ) as covariates. The treatment difference in terms of least square (LS) mean change from baseline will be estimated from this model together with 95% CIand nominal two-sided p-value . Model-based LS mean with 95% CI will be provided by treatment group for PRO scores at baseline and post-baseline time point. The cLDA model assumes a common mean across treatment groups at baseline and a different mean for each treatment at each of thepost-baseline time points. In this model, the response vector consists of baseline and the values observed at each post -baseline time point. Time is treated as a 06F9HF 07YK6K"

The cLDA model is specified as follows:        =    +      (  > 0 )+     ,   = 1,2, ,3, . . ,  ;   = 0,1,2,3, . .   where Yijtis the PRO score for participant i, with treatment assignment jat visit t; γ0is the baseline mean for all treatment groups, γjtis the mean change from baseline for treatment group j at time t ; Xiis the stratification factor (binary) vector for this participant, and βis the coefficient vector for stratification factors. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the correlation among repeated measurements. If the unstructured covariance model fails to converge with the default algorithm, then Fisher scoring algorithm or other appropriate methods can be used to provide initial values of the covariance parameters. In the rare event that none of the above methods yield convergence, a structured covariance such as Toeplitz can be used to model the correlation among repeated measurements. In this case, the asympt otically unbiased sandwich variance estimator will be used. The cLDA model implicitly treats missing data as missing at random (MAR). Line plots for the empirical mean change from baseline in the EORTC QLQ -C30 global health status/QoL, physical functioning and dyspnea scores and EORTC QLQ -LC13 cough andchest pain scores (as specified in section 3.4.3) will be provided across all time points as a supportive analysis. In addition, the model -based LS mean change from baseline to the specified post -baseline t ime point together with 95% CI will be plotted in bar charts for the EORTC QLQ -C30 global health status/QoL, physical functioning and symptom scales, and EORTC QLQ -LC13 symptom scales (as specified in section 3.4.3). 3.6.3.4. Time -to-True Deterioration (TTD) Analysis The non -parametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the deterioration curve in each group. The estimate of median time to deterioration and its 95% confidence interval will be obtained from the Kaplan -Meier survival estimates. The treatment difference in TTD will be assessed by the stratified log -rank test , and nominal two -sided p- values will be reported . A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron’s method of tie handling will be used to assess the magnitu de of the treatment difference (hazard ratio) between treatment arms. Stratification factors used for randomization (See Section 6.3.2 in the protocol) will be applied to the analysis will be used in the stratified Cox PH model. The approach for the time-to-deterioration analysis will be based on the assumption of non- informative censoring.

The point estimate of overall proportions of participants who have achieved an improvement, stability ,and deterioration will be provided by treatment group together with 95% CI using exact binomial method by Clopper and Pearson (1934). Stratified Miettinen and Nurminen’s method will be used for comparison of the overall improvement rate between the treatment groups.

At the time of an analysis, the observed number of events may differ subst antially from the expected. To avoid overspending at an interim analysis and leave reasonable alpha for the final analysis, the minimum alpha spending strategy will be adopted. At an IA, the information fraction used in Lan -DeMets spending function to dete rmine the alpha spending at the IA will be based on the minimum of the expected information fraction and the actual information fraction at each analysis. Specifically, In the scenario that the events accrue slower than expected and the observed number o f events is less than the expected number of events at a given analysis, the information fraction will be calculated as the observed number of events at the interim analysis over the target number of events at FA. In the scenario that the events accrue f aster than expected and the observed number of events exceeds the expected number of events at a given analysis, then the information fraction will be calculated as the expected number of events at the interim analysis over the target number of events at F A. 06F9HF 07YK6K"
186,page_186,"MK-7902 PAGE 29 PROTOCOL NO.007 -05(E7080 -G000 -314) Supplemental SAP 15JUL2021 The final analysis will use the remaining Type I error that has not been spent at the earlier analyses. The event counts for all analyses will be used to compute correlations. Of note, while the information fraction used for alpha spending calculation w ill be the minimum of the actual information fraction and the expected information fraction, the correlations required for deriving the bounds will still be computed using the actual information fraction based on the observed number of events at each analy sis over the target number of events at FA. The minimum spending approach assumes timing is not based on any observed Z -value and thus the Z test statistics used for testing conditioned on timing are multivariate normal. Given the probabilities derived wit h the proposed spending method, the correlations based on actual event counts are used to compute bounds that control the Type I error at the specified alpha level for a given hypothesis conditioned on the interim analysis timing. Since this is true regard less of what is conditioned on, the overall Type I error for a given hypothesis unconditionally is controlled at the specified level. By using more conservative spending early in the study, power can be retained to detect situations where the treatment eff ect may be delayed. 3.8.4. Safety Analyses The DMC has responsibility for assessment of overall risk:benefit. When prompted by safety concerns, the DMC can request corresponding efficacy data. DMC review of efficacy data to assess the overall risk:benefit to study participants will not require a multiplicity adjustment typically associated with a planned efficacy interim analysis. 3.9.Sample Size and Power Calculations The study will randomize 620 participants in a 1:1 ratio into the pembrolizumab + lenvatinib and pembrolizumab + placebo arms. PFS and OS are primary endpoints for the study, with OR as the secondary endpoint. For the PFS endpoint, based on a target number of 416 events at the final PFSanalysis , the study has approximately 86.5% power to detect an HR of 0.7 at the initially allocated α=0.0055 (1-sided). For the OS endpoint, based on a target number of 388events and one interim analys is at approximately 78% of the target number of events, the study has approximately 90% power to detect an HR of 0.71 at the initially allocated α=0.0195 (1 -sided). Based on KEYNOTE -042 data, t he above sample size and power calculations for PFS and OS assume the following: PFS follows a piecewise exponential distribution, with a median of 5 months up to 6.5 months and then a median of 12 months th ereafter for the control group OS follows an exponential distribution, with a median of 16.7 months for the control group Enrollment period is approximately 21.7 months Annual drop -out rate is 20% and 2% for PFS and OS, respectively 06F9HF 07YK6K"

Subgroup Analyses To determine whether the treatment effect is consistent across various subgroups, the between - group treatment effect for OS, PFS, and OR (with a nominal 95% CI) will be estimated and plotted by treatment group within each category of the following subgroup variables: Geographic region (East Asia, non -East Asia) ECOG performance status (0, 1) Predominant tumor histology (squamous, nonsquamous) TPS (1% -49%, ≥50%) Age category (<65, ≥65 years) Sex (female, male) Race (white, nonwhite) Smoking status (never, former/current smoker) Brain metastasi s at baseline (presence, absence) Liver metastasis at baseline (presence, absence) The consistency of the treatment effect will be assessed using descriptive statistics for each category of the subgroup variables listed above. If the number of participants in a category of a subgroup variable is less than 10% of the ITT population, the subgroup analysis will not be performed for this category of the subgroup variable, and this subgroup variable will not be displayed in the forest plot. The subgroup analyses for PFS and OS will be conducted using unstratified Cox model, and the subgroup analyses for OR will be conducted using unstratified Miettinen and Nurminen method. 3.11.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN FOR EXTENSION This section outlines the statistical analysis strategy and procedures for China specific subgroup analysis ,which is required by the Chinese regulatory authority. 4.1.Introduction After the global study enrollment is closed, subjects from China will continue to be enrolled in an extension portion designed to meet China local registration needs. The extension portion will be identical to the global study (e.g., inclusion and exclusion criteria, primary and secondary endpoints, study procedures) in gene ral, with the additional statistical analysis plan for the Chinese subpopulation. The purpose of this extension portion is to evaluate the consistency of efficacy and safety in the Chinese subpopulation to the global population. Country- specific analysis may also be conducted per local regulatory requirement. After the enrollment for the global study is completed, subjects in China will continue to be enrolled in a 1:1 ratio into the pembrolizumab + lenvatinib arm and pembrolizumab + placebo armuntil the s ample size for the Chinese subpopulation reaches approximately 120in total between the global and extension portion. After the cut-off date for the primary analyses of the global study (including interim and final analyses), all Chinese subjects, including subjects enrolled in the global study and the extension portion, will continue their randomized treatment and continue to be followed up for PFS and OS events for China registration purpose. The extension portion will be completed after target number of PFS or OS events (Section 4.7) has been observed between the two arms in the Chinese subpopulation. However, if the target number of PFS or OS events in the Chinese subpopulation is reached before an IA for the global study, the corresponding analysis for Chinese subpopulation will occur at the same time as the global IA or the final analysis (global stu dy). 4.2. Responsibility for Analyses/In -House Blinding For all Chinese subjects, including subjects randomized in the global study and the extension portion, patient level treatment randomization information will be blinded for the statistician(s)/programmer( s) responsible for the China extension portion analysis until the extension portion data base lock is achieved. The extent to which individuals are unblinded to the results will be limited. Blinded and unblinded members will be clearly documented with blin ding status along with time information. 4.3.Hypotheses/Estimation No hypothesis testing is planned for the China extension portion. Nominal p values will be reported for efficacy analyses if applicable but should be interpreted with caution due to potential issues of multiplicity. After succeeding in the global study, the consistency of efficacy and safety in the Chinese subpopulation to the global population will be evaluated. Consistency of efficacy will be evaluated using the percentage of risk reduction pr eserved in the Chinese subpopulation from the empirical 06F9HF 07YK6K"

Sample size is designed to provide about 80% chance of observing the point estimate of Chinese subpopulation preser ves ≥ approximately 50% of empirical risk reduction from the global primary efficacy analysis assuming the same hazard ratio used in the sample size and power calculation for the global study. 4.4.The Analysis Endpoints 4.4.1. Efficacy Endpoints 4.4.1.1. Primary Endpoints PFS:the time from randomization to the first documented PD per RECIST 1.1, adjusted to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, based on BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. See Sectio n 3.6.1 for the definition of censoring. OS:the time from randomization to death due to any cause. 4.4.1.2. Secondary Endpoints OR:a confirmed CR or PR per RECIST 1.1, adjusted to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, based on BICR. 4.4.1.3. Exploratory Endpoints DOR :the time from the earliest date of qualifying response until earliest date of PD or death from any cause, whichever comes first. 4.4.2. Safety Endpoints Safety and tolerability will be assessed by clinical review of all relevant parameters including AEs, SAEs, fatal AEs, laboratory tests, and vital signs. Furthermore, specific events will be collected and designated as ECIs as described in Section 8.4.7 of the study protocol. 4.4.3. Patient -reported Outcome Endpoints Secondary Mean c hange from baseline in EORTC QLQ -C30 global health status/QoL (items 29 -30), physical functioning (items 1 -5), and dyspnea scores (item 8), and EORTC QLQ- LC13 cough (item 31) and chest pain (item 40) scores. TTD as measured by each of the EORTC QL Q-C30 global health status/QoL, physical functioning, and dyspnea scores, and EORTC QLQ- LC13 cough and chest pain scores. TTD as measured by a composite symptom endpoint: cough (QLQ -LC13 item 31), chest pain (QLQ -LC13 item 40), or dyspnea (QLQ -C30 item 8) 06F9HF 07YK6K"
190,page_190,"MK-7902 PAGE 33 PROTOCOL NO.007 -05(E7080 -G000 -314) Supplemental SAP 15JUL2021 Based on prior lite rature (Osoba D et al., 1998; King et al., 1996, Marringwa et al., 2011) , a ≥10 point or greater worsening from baseline for each scale represents a minimally important difference (MID) that represents a clinically relevant deterioration. TTD in the individual scores specified above is defined as the time to first onset of ≥ 10 (out of 100) point deterioration from baseline in a given scale/ subscale/item and confirmed by a second adjacent ≥10 point deterioration from baseline. TTD in the composite endpoint is defined as the time to first onset of a ≥10 point deterioration (i.e., i ncrease in score) from baseline in any one of the 3 lung cancer symptom scale items (EORTC -QLQ- C30 [dyspnea] and EORTC -QLQ- LC13 [cough and chest pain]) with confirmation by the subsequent visit of a ≥10 point deterioration (i.e., increase in score) from ba seline in the same scale as the first onset . Changes from baseline in EORTC QLQ - C30 scores will also be interpreted according to recent subscale -specific guidelines, which indicate that clinically meaningful differences vary by scale (Cocks et al., 2012) 4.5.Analysis Populations 4.5.1. Efficacy Analysis Populations Efficacy analysis will be carried out in the intention- to-treat (ITT) China subpopulation. This population will include all Chinese participants who are randomized in the global study and all participants who are randomized in the extension portion. Participants from China enrolled in the extension portion of this study after completion of the global enrollment will not be included in the primary efficacy analysis population for the global study. 4.5.2. Safety Analysis Populations Safety analysis will be carried out in the All Patients as Treated (APaT) China subpopulation, i.e., all randomized Chinese participants (in the global study and extension portion) who received at least 1 dose of study treatment. Participants from China randomized and treated in the extension portion of this study after completion of the global enrollment will not be included in the primary safety analysis population for the global study. 4.5.3. Patient -reported Outcome Analysis Population The PRO analyses are based on the PRO Full Analysis Set (PRO FAS) China subpopulation, defined as all randomized participants who have at least one PRO assessment available for the specific endpoint and have received at least one dose of the study intervention. Participants will be analyzed in the treatment group to which they are randomized. The PRO FAS China subpopulation will include all Chinese participants (in the global study and extension portion) in this population. 06F9HF 07YK6K"

Pharmacokinetic Analysis Population The analysis of PK data will be carried out in t he population PK analysis setChina subpopulation. The Population PK Analysis set will include all participants who have received at least 1 dose of study intervention with documented dosing history in the lenvatinib + pembrolizumab arm and have measurable plasma levels of lenvatinib or serum levels of pembrolizumab . Population PK Analysis Set China subpopulation will include all Chinese participants (in the global study and extension portion) in this population. Participants from China enrolled in the exte nsion portion of this study after completion of the global enrollment will not be included in the primary PK analysis population for the global study. 4.6.Statistical Methods Regarding the analysis for extension, no formal hypothesis testing is planned. No multiplicity adjustment will be applied to the analysis for extension. 4.6.1. Statistical Methods for Efficacy Analyses Analyses regarding objective response and disease progression will include all events in all participants excluding events that occur in the Second Course Treatment. 4.6.1.1. Progression- free Survival Analysis of PFS for extension is the same to that for the global study if applicable. The nonparametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the PFS curve in each treatment group. The treatment difference in PFS will be assessed by the stratified log -rank test (based on the stratification factors defined in Section 6.3.2 in the protocol ). . A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling will be used to estimate the magnitude of the treatment difference (ie, HR) between the treatment arms. The HR and its 95% CI from the stratified Cox model with Efron's method of tie handling and with a single treatment covariate will be reported. The same stratification factors used in the global st udy will be used (see section 6.3.2 in the protocol) . For the Chinese subgroup analys es, the stratified method will only be used if applicable. The factor of geograph ic region (East Asia vs. non- East Asia) will not be included in the Chinese subgroup stratified analys es.Ananalysis using the restricted mean survival time method may be conducted for PFS to account for the possible nonproportional hazards effect. Consistency of efficacy will be evaluated using the percentage of risk reduction preserved in the Chinese subpopulation from the empirical risk reduction from the global primary efficacy analyses (based on point estimates). Sample size is designed to provide about 80% cha nce of observing the point estimate of Chinese subpopulation preserves ≥ approximately 50% of empirical risk 06F9HF 07YK6K"

The primary analysis for PFS will be conducted in the Chinese subpopulation when approximately 75 PFS events have been collected. 4.6.1.2. Overall Survival Analysis of OS for extension is the same to that for the global study if applicable. The nonparametric Ka plan-Meier method will be used to estimate the survival curves. The treatment difference in OS will be assessed by the stratified log -rank test (based on the stratification factors defined in Section 6.3.2 in the protocol ). A stratified Cox proportional hazard model with Efron's method of tie handling will be used to assess the magnitude of the treatment difference (ie, the HR). The HR and its 95% CI from the stratified Cox model with a single treatment covariate will be reported. The stratification factors used for randomization (Section 6.3.2 in the protocol ) will be applied to both the stratified log-rank test and the stratified Cox model. The same stratification factors used in the global study will be used. For the Chinese subgroup analysis, the stratified method will only be used if applicable. The factor of Geography (East Asia vs. non -East Asia) will not be included in the stratified analysis for the Chinese subgroup analysis. Participants without documented death at the time of analysis will be censored at the date of last known contact. Ananalysis using the restricted mean survival time method may be conducted for OS to account for the possible nonproportional hazards effect. Consistency in OS will be evaluated similarly as that in PFS. The primary analysis for OS will be conducted in the Chinese subpopulation when approximately 75 OS events have been collected. 4.6.1.3. Objective Response Rate Analysis of ORR or DOR for extension is the same to that for the global study if applicable. The stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method will be used for comparison of ORR between the treatment groups. The di fference in ORR and its 95% CI from the stratified Miettinen and Nurminen method with strata weighting by sample size will be provided. The same stratification factors used for randomization (Section 6.3.2 of the study protocol) will be used as stratificat ion factors in the analysis. The same stratification factors used in the global study will be used. For the Chinese subpopulation analysis, the stratified method will only be used if applicable. The factor of Geography (East Asia vs. non- East Asia) will not be included in the stratified analysis for Chinese subgroup analysis. 4.6.1.4. Duration of Response For subjects who demonstrate CR or PR, DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. The nonparametric Kaplan -Meier method will be used to summarize the DOR. The median and range of DOR will be provided. 06F9HF 07YK6K"

OS will also be analyzed. The primary analysis for OS will be conducted in the Chinese subpopulation when approximately 75 OS events have been collected. 4.8.Multiplicity No multiplicity adjustment will be applied to the analysis of China. 4.9.Sample Size and Power Calculations After the completion of global study enrollment, the extension portion will continue to enroll participants and randomize eligible participants until the sample size for the overall randomized Chinese subpopulation reaches approximately 120. Participants from China enrolled in the extension portion of this study after completion of the global enrollment will not be included in the primary efficacy analysis population for the global study. The extension portion will complete after approxim ately 75OS events have been observed between the two arms in the Chinese subpopulation. With 75OS events and a true hazard ratio of 0.7, the extension portion has ~80% chance to observe a point estimate of OS that preserves ≥ approximately 50% of the empirical risk reduction from the global analysis in the Chinese subpopulation. With 75 PFS events and a true hazard ratio of 0.7, the extension portion has ~80% chance to observe a point estimate of PFS that preserves ≥ approximately 50% of the empirical risk reduction from the global analysis in the Chinese subpopulation. The above calculations for the consistency evaluation in OS and PFS are based on the same assumptions in the global study for sample size and power evaluation as specified in Section 3.9. 06F9HF 07YK6K"
