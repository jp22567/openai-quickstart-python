In spite of these treatments, 5- year survival is only about 17% for advanced -stage NSCL C patients, highlighting the need for novel therapies and treatment regimens .6,7 Molecularl y targeted therapy has been successful in NSCL C patients who have tumors that harbor various alterations, including the fusion protein EML 4-ALK. The first approved agent for anaplastic l ymphoma kinase ( ALK )-positive NSCL C wascrizotinib. Although most patients with AL K-positive NSCL C derive substantial clinical benefit from crizot inib, some ALK -positive NSCLC patients will not derive any benefit (intrinsic resistance), while other patients who initially derive benefit will develop resistance (acquired resistance). In the case of crizotinib -resistant AL K-positive NSCLC, the rate of resistance due to mutations in the ALK kinase domain is ty picall y reported in the range of 35 -40%.31In response to causes of crizotinib treatment failure, next -generation AL K/ROS1TKIs are being developed. The second- generation ALK inhibitors, which have demonstrated activity in a crizotinib -refractory or resistant treatment setting, may have the potential for even greater activity in treatment -naïve patients. Data from b oth alectinib1,21and ceritinib25have shown that using these more potent agents in the first -line advanced ALK -positive NSCL C treatment setting may exceed the median progression -free survival ( PFS) time for crizotinib. Lorlatinib is a selective , brain -penetrant ALK TKI with potent activity against AL K and ROS1 fusions, including those harboring resistance mutations . Lorlatinib has demonstrated clinically meaningful anti- tumor activity in patients with brain metastases after treatment with AL K inhibitors including crizotinib.30Further, lorlatinib appears to be the only ALK TKI active against certain mutations that are the most difficult to inhibit , such as the G1202R mutation. Lorlatinib has the potential to improve PFS in the treatment -naïve advanced ALK -positive NSCL Ctreatment setting based on its greater potency against ALK and its broad coverage against all known single point mutations that mediate resistance to crizotinib and second -generation ALK inhibitors.29"

Sample Size Determination The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that lorlatinib (Arm A) is superior to crizotinib (Arm B) in prolonging PFS by BICR assessment per RECIST v1.1. A key secondary objective of the study is to demonstrate that lorlatinib is superior to crizotinib inprolonging OS. The study is designed to test H 0: HR PFS≥1 vs. H A: HR PFS<1, where HR PFSis the hazard ratio (Arm A/Arm B) of PFS. Approximately 280 patients (140 in each arm) were to be randomized using a 1:1 ratio stratified by presence of brain metastases and ethnic origin. As of 28 February, 2019 enrollment was closed with 296 patients randomized. One hundred seventy seven (177) PFS events will be required to have at least 90% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.611 using a one-sided stratified log-rank test at a significance level of 0.025, and a 2-look group-sequential design with a Lan-DeMets (O’Brien-Fleming) α-spending function to determine the efficacy boundaries The planned sample size was determined based on the assumption of a HR of 0.611 under the alternative hypothesis which, under an exponential model, assumes a median PFS of 11 months in the crizotinib arm and 18 months in the lorlatinib arm. The sample size further assumed a 15% drop-out rate within each treatment arm at 30 months and a non-uniform patient accrual over approximately 15 months and follow-up after the last patient is randomized of approximately 18 months This sample size will also allow comparison of OS between the 2 treatment arms, provided that superiority of lorlatinib over crizotinib with respect to PFS has been demonstrated. If the true HR is 0.70 under the alternative hypothesis (under an exponential model, assumes median OS of 48 months on the crizotinib arm and 68.6 months on the lorlatinib arm), a total of 198 deaths will be required to have 70% power using a one-sided stratified log-rank test at a significance level of 0.025, and a 3-look group-sequential design with Lan-DeMets (O’Brien-Fleming) α-spending function to determine the efficacy boundaries. These calculations further assumed a 15% drop-out rate for OS on either treatment arm at 120 months and a follow-up of approximately 110 months after the last patient is randomized.CCI"

Acceptable time windows for performing each assessment are described in the column headers. 1. Screening : To be obtained within 28 days prior to randomization. Available results for assessements that have been performed prior to in formed consent being obtained as part of routine standard of care (laboratory tests or tumor imaging scans ) may be used to determine patient eligibility, provi ded they have been performed within the required timing (that is 7 days prior randomization for laboratory tests or 28 days prior randomization for tumor imaging). 2. Informed Consent : Must be obtained prior to undergoing any study-specific procedures. Informed consent for use of tissue for other research or diagnostic development must also be obtained. Molecular Presceening Informed Consent must also be obtained in case the ALK status determi nation is not already available or has been performed through a test different from the required Ventana ALK (D5F3). IHC test performed on the ULTRA or XT platforms are a cceptable, while tests performed on the GX platform cannot be accepted. 3. Prescreening activities to determine ALK status will be performed as needed: a. Patients who have historical results available showing ALK-positivity through Ventana ALK D5F3 CDx(Companion Diagnostics) test can proceed with the screening assessments. Available pathological reports must be prospectively collected and sent to Pfizer for confirmation of patient eli gibility. b. Patients who have historical results available showing ALK-positivity through a non-Ventana ALK D5F3 CDx test can start the sc reening assessments while waiting for the Ventana ALK D5F3 CDx assay to be performed. Re -testing time should be in the 28 days time window. c. Patients who do not have historical results available must undergo a pre-screening Ventana ALK D5F3 CDx test and, if positive, can start the screening assessments. Please refer to Section 6.1.1.1 for additional details. 4. Baseline Signs and Symptoms: Patients will be asked about any signs and symptoms experienced and present pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycle 1. 5. Ophthalmologic Examination (right and left eye): Includes best corrected visual acuity, and refractive error slit lamp biomic roscopy and fundoscopy, and should be performed by an ophthalmologist. Testing will be performed at screening and should be repeated during the study whenever a vision disorde r AE is observed or CTCAE grade change occurs from the previous visit (more frequent examinations may be performed based on local requirement). 6. Vital Signs: Blood pressure and pulse rate to be recorded in sitting position after 5 min rest. Body weight to be recorded on Day 1 of each cycle. 7. Performance Status: According to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) classification (see Appendix 2 ). 8. Contraception Check: Male patients who are able to father children and female patients who are of childbearing potential will need to follow the contraception guidelines in Section 4.3.1 . 9. Hematology: Required tests are listed in the Appendix 4 of the protocol. Not to be repeated at C1D1 if performed within 7 days before. May also be performed when clinically indicated (results to be entered in CRF as unplanned visit). 10. Blood Chemistry: Required tests are listed in Appendix 4 of the protocol.

Serum or Urine Pregnancy Test: For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, to be perform ed on two occasions prior to starting study therapy, once at the start of screening (serum) and once at the baseline visit (serum or urine), whose results must be availabl e before investigational product administration. Pregnancy tests also routinely repeated at every cycle during the active treatment period, at the end of treatment and addition ally whenever one menstrual cycle is missed or when potential pregnancy is otherwise suspected. Additional pregnancy tests if requested by IRB/IECs or by local regulations. 15. Triplicate 12-Lead ECGs: At each time point, 3 consecutive 12-lead ECGs are to be performed approximately 2 minutes apart (or within 10 minutes, whichever is applicable). The ECG must occur prior to any blood sample collections or venipuncturing. Whenever it is not feasible, blood chemistry and he matology lab tests may be collected prior to the pre-dose ECG provided at least 30 minutes has elapsed between the venipunturing and the collection of the ECG. For Arm A (lorlatinib), ECGs are to be collected at pre-dose and 1-4 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1. ECGs will also be collected at 1-4 h ours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 8 and Day 15, and on Cycle 2 Day 1. Additional ECGs may be collected as clinically indicated. For Arm B (crizotinib), ECGs are to be collec ted at pre-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1. For Cycle 2 Day 1, the ECGs must be collected 2-6 hours after the morning dose. Additional ECGs at may be collected as clinically in dicated. At End of Treatment/Withdrawal, triplicate ECGs are to be collected for both treatment arms. Additional ECG time points may be performed based on the emerging data. Single reading ECG are to be collected pre-dose on Day 1 of Cycle 3 and every other cycle thereafter. 16. LVEF Assessment: Echocardiogram or MUGA to be performed at Screening, at pre-dose (0 hour), on Cycle 1 Day 1 and on Day 1 of eve ry other cycle thereafter, and at the EOT visit. The same method should be used at each time point. If the screening ECHO or MUGA is normal and has been performed within 2 weeks prior to randomization, there is no need to repeat this assessment at Day1 of Cycle 1. At subsequent visits a time window of 1 week prior to Day 1 of sub sequent cycles will be permitted for the ECHO/MUGA assessment. 17. Randomization: Patient number and treatment arm allocation will be operated through an automated system. Study treatments t o be initiated preferably on the randomization day but no later than 7 days after randomization. Arm A: lorlatinib administered orally, on a continuous QD dosing schedule, as described in Section 5.4.1 . Arm B: crizotinib administered orally, on a continuous BID dosing schedule, as described in Section 5.4.2 . 18. Tumor Assessments: To include all known or suspected disease sites. Baseline and on study imaging to include as mandatory e xams: chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT or MRI scans; Brain MRI; Bone scan or MRI. Brain MRI (Gadolinium contrast enhanced) to be used for assessment of CNS lesions (even if brain metastases not suspected), with contingent slices of 1 mm for lesions with a minimum size of 5 mm – 10 mm in size, 5 mm for lesions greater than 10 mm. Bone scans ( or bone MRI if preferred by investigator) to be performed at baseline for all patients and repeated every 16 weeks (+1 week) on study only if evidence of bone metastases is observed at baseline. For all tumor assessments, the method of assessment that was used at baseline should be the same method used throughout the study. CT or MRI scans to be done at every 8 weeks ±1 week (every 16 weeks for bone scans/MRI) starting from randomization while on treatment or post-treatment follow-up (until PD). Responses will be confirmed ≥4 weeks later. Tumor assessment should be repeated at the EOT visit if more than 8 weeks have passed since the last evaluation. Tumor assessments must continue until documented progression of disease by BICR. If a patient continues study treatment beyond disease progression confirmed by BICR, based on investigator judgement of clinical benefit, (eg, in case the intracranial lesions are not in progression) tumor assessment must continue to be performed every 8 weeks ±1 week (16 weeks ±1 week for Bone Scan/MRI if applicable). Patients who discontinue treatment without PD should be followed radiologically until PD is confirmed by BICR reg ardless of subsequent anti-cancer treatments. Assessment of response will be made using RECIST v.1.1. Assessment of response of measurable intracranial disease will be made using a modified version of RECIST v.1.1.33 19. Diagnostic Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) analysis is mandatory for patients with suspected or confirmed leptomeningeal disease/c arcinomatous meningitis (LMD/CM) not visualized on MRI (optional for the remaining patients). To be performed at baseline, and if clinically safe and feasible, fur ther CSF cytology will be performed as clinically indicated to assess anti-tumor response and to determine crizotinib concentrations. (Of note: if a patient is required to und ergo a lumbar puncture while on study drug, an additional ~5 mL sample of CSF should be collected for determining crizotinib and its metabolite (for Arm B) concentrations. If a CSF sample is collected, Detailed collection procedures will be provided in the Study Manual).CCI CCICCI CCI"

Adverse Event (AE) Assessments: AEs should be documented and recorded at each visit using the National Cancer Institute Comm on Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) version 4.03. For AEs and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), the active collection period to Pfizer or its desig nated representative begins from the time that the patient provides informed consent, through and including 28 calendar days after the last administration of the investig ational product. If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, the recording period for non-serious AEs ends at the time the new treatment is started. Death must be report ed if it occurs during the SAE reporting period after the last dose of investigational product, irrespective of any intervening treatment. 21. Concomitant Medications and Non-Drug Supportive Interventions: All concomitant medications and non-drug supportive intervent ions will be recorded in the CRF from 28 days prior to start of study treatment and up to 28 after the last dose of study treatment. 22. PRO Assessment: Patients must complete all EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-LC13, and EQ-5D-5L self-assessment questionnaires in the clinic as these cannot be taken home. All scheduled assessments of the EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ-LC13, and EQ-5D-5L must be completed in the clinic prior to an y other study or medical procedures. 23. Mood Assessment: An assessment of mood via the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI II) scale will be administered to patients prior to the first day of investigational drugs dosing (ie, Cycle 1 Day1) and then prior to dosing on Day 1 of Cycle 2 through –Cycle 6. After Cycle 6 Day 1, this test will be ad ministered prior to dosing on Day 1 of every other cycle (ie, Cycle 8 Day 1, Cycle 10 Day 1, etc.) and at EOT. 24. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior: An assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior via the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scal e (C- SSRS) will be administered to patients prior to the first day of investigational drugs dosing (ie, Cycle 1 Day1) and then prior to dosing on Day 1 of Cycle 2 through Cyc le 6. After Cycle 6 Day 1, this test will be administered prior to dosing on Day 1 of every other cycle (ie, Cycle 8 Day 1, Cycle 10 Day 1, etc.) and at EOT. 25. Archival Tumor Tissue Specimens: All patients must provide a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) archival tumor specimen , specifically a FFPE tissue block that contains sufficient tissue to generate at least 10 (preferably 15) unstained slides, each with tissue sections that are ~5-micro ns thick. If a FFPE tissue block cannot be provided, at least 10 (preferably 15) unbaked glass slides, each containing an unstained ~5-micron FFPE tissue section must be s ubmitted. If archived FFPE tissue is not available, a de novo (fresh) tumor sample must be obtained in accordance with local institutional practice for tumor biopsies. Acquisition of archival or de novo tumor tissue is mandatory for patient enrollment. Archived or de novo tumor tissue from cytological sampling (eg, fine needle aspiration, pl eural effusion, including FFPE block is acceptable at screening and can be submitted. Archived or de novo tumor tissue from bone metastasis (eg, bone biopsy specimen) , is not adequate at screening and should not be submitted. 26. De Novo Tumor Specimens: De novo tumor core needle biopsy collection will be mandatory at screening if archival tissue is no t available. Endobronchial Ultrasound Guided Transbronchial Core Needle biopsies are adequate. Pleural effusions (PE) cell pellets may substitute for tum or core biopsy as appropriate. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) samples (2-3 pass minimum prepared as FFPE cell block) should only be performed in the event a biopsy or pleura l effusion cell pellet is not safe or feasible. Tumor tissue should be provided as a FFPE tumor tissue block containing sufficient tumor tissue to allow if possible for sectioning of at least 10 (preferably 15) slides each containing a ~5-micron tissue section. If local country regulations do not allow for tissue block to be submitted or if a tissue block cannot be provided, sites should provide if possible at least 10 (preferably 15) unbaked glass slides each containing a ~5-micron tissue section cut seria lly from the same block. Details for handling of these samples including processing, storage, and shipment will be provided in the Study Manual. CCI CCI"

End of Treatment (EOT) Visit: Obtain these asses sments if not completed in the last week (Tumor assessment should be repeated a the EOT visit if more than 8 weeks have passed since the last evaluation.). EOT visit is usually scheduled for 28 days after the last dose of investigational product or when d ecision taken to provide alternative anti-cancer therapy whichever is sooner. 31. Post-Treatment Follow -Up Visits: Patients will return to undergo review of concomitant medications, laboratory tests, vital signs, and assessment f or resolution of any treatment -related toxicity until PD or until the time of in itiation of new anticancer treatment. At this point, patients continuing to experience treatment related toxicities will continue to be followed at least every 4 weeks (except for the tumor assessment which will be performed every 8 weeks 1week (every 16 weeks week for bone scan/MRI if applicable), until resolution or determination, in the clinical judgment of the Investigator, that no further improvement is expected. Patients discontinuing treatment fo r reasons other than progression of disease will continue to perform tumor assessments until PD documented by BICR, regardless of subsequent anti -cancer treatments. 32. Survival Follow -Up: After discontinuation of study treatment, information on post -study su rvival status and subsequent anti -cancer treatment (including administration start and stop dates, reason for treatment discontinuation and date of disease progression, if applicable) will be collected every 4months up to 3 years, then every 6 months unti l death, or patient withdrawal of consent or study closure (after the required number of OS events have been reported), whichev er occurs first.

The mechanism of actions of crizotinib and lorlatinib are described in Section 1.2.4 and Section 1.2.5 , respec tively . 1.2.Background and Rationale 1.2.1. NSCLC NSCL C is the most common cause of fatal malignancy globall y, most often diagnosed in advanced stages, where surgery and local radiotherapy are no longer curative or indicated.1,2Standard therap y in later stages of disease is primaril y palliative in nature, involving the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy and immunotherapy .3,4,5 In spite of these treatments, 5 -year survival is only about 17% for advanced- stage NSCL C patients, highlighting the need for novel therapies and treatment regimens.6,7 Targeted therapies such as ty rosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may be used in advanced NSCL C patients who have tumors that harbor various alterations, including the fusion protein EML 4-ALK. The first approved agent for anaplastic l ymphoma kinase (ALK) -positive NSCL C was crizotinib . Although most patients with AL K-positive NSCL C derive substantial clinical benefit from crizotinib, some ALK -positive NSCLC patients will not derive an y benefit (intrinsic resistance) ,while other patients who initially derive benefit will develop resistance (acquired resistance). In the case of crizotinib- resistant ALK -positive NSCL C, the rate of resistance due to mutations in the ALK kinase domain is ty picall y reported in the range of 35 -40%.31 1.2.2. ALK Alterations in NSCLC A rearrangement within chromosome 2p resulting in the formation of a fusion gene product comprising portions of the echinoderm microtubule- associated protein -like-4(EML 4) gene and the ALK gene was discovered in 2007 in NSCLC cell lines and archived clinical specimens.8A subsequent series of studies have described 9 fusion variants of EML 4-ALK plus additional but less common fusion partners with AL K.9Currentl y, there are at least 27different ALK fusion variants reported in the literature, the majority of isoforms involve EML 4-ALK. ALK -positive NSCL C patients, who represent be tween 3% and 5% of all NSCL C cases, tend to be y oung (average age 50 years at diagnosis), and light or never smokers.10"

Targeting ALK orROS1 in these cancers provides a novel opportunity to selectivel y target cancer cells bearing ALK or ROS1 fusions that are implicated as causative oncogenic driver events in these patients’ tumors.12,13 The first -generation ALK/ROS1/cMET inhibitor crizotinib (Xalkori®) has demonstrated impressive clinical benefit in AL K and ROS1 fusion -positive lung cancers12,13leading to the approval of crizotinib for the treatment of advanced ALK -positive NSCL C patients. The European Commission also approved a product label update to expand use of crizotinib to first-line treatment of adults with AL K-positive advanced NSCLC.13Thus, crizotinib has become the global standard of care (SOC) for patients with AL K-positive NSCL C. 1.2.3. Resistance Mechanisms Although most patients with AL K-positive NSCLC derive substantial clinical benefit from crizotinib, some patients will not derive any benefit (intrinsic resistance), while most patients who initially derived benefit will eventually develop resistance (acquired resistance) to crizotinib.14Acquired ALK kinase domain mutations and/or brain metastases are two major relapse mechanisms to crizotinib therapy .14,15,16In the case of crizotinib -resistant ALK -positive NSCL C, the rate of resistance due to mutations in the AL K kinase domain is typicall y reported in the range of 35 -40%.16Resistance to ALK TKIs may be related to gatekeeper mutations along with activation of by pass resistance mechanisms such as somatic variations in tumor response pathway s. Multiple ty pes of ALK kinase mutations have been identified in crizotinib -refractory or resistant patients.16-19 In response to these causes of crizotinib treatment failure, next-generation ALK/ROS1 TKIs are being developed. The first of the second -generation ALK inhibitors to show a significant clinica l activity has been ceritinib (Z YKADIATM).20Results from a global Phase 1 study led to the drug’s accelerated approval for the treatment of NSCL C patients who progressed or were intolerant to crizotinib in US and Europe, based on tumor response and duration of response. Alectinib (ALECENSATM) is aselective ALK inhibitor, has CNS (central nervous s ystem) activity ,and has shown clinical activity in both crizotinib -resistant and treatment -naïve patients. Alectinib is approved in Japan and has received accelerated approval in the US for the treatment of patients with AL K-positive NSCLC who have progressed or are int olerant to crizotinib.23 The second- generation ALK inhibitors, which have demonstrated activity in a crizotinib -refractory or resistant treatment setting, may have the potential for even greater activity in treatment -naïve patients. Data from both alectinib1,21and ceritinib25have shown that using these more potent agents in the first -line advanced ALK -positive NSCL C treatment setting may exceed the median PFS time for crizotinib."

The study Primary Completion Date that is the final data collection for the primary outcome measure is expected in March 2017. 24 In the Phase 1/2 Study B7461001, lorlatinib demonstrated robust clinical activity in both ALK-positive and ROS1-positive NSCLC patients, most of whom had brain metastases and had received ≥1 prior ALK TKI. An objective response rate (ORR) of 46% was observed in patients who received ≥2 prior ALK TKI treatments. When considering the patients who received only 1 previous ALK TKI, the ORR was 57%. Significant intracranial responses were also observed, showing that lorlatinib can cross the blood–brain barrier to achieve clinically meaningful anti-tumor activity in patients with brain metastases after treatment with ALK inhibitors including crizotinib. Lorlatinib in fact showed an intracranial ORR of 31% when considering both target and non-target lesions and of 39% when considering the target lesions only. 30Further, lorlatinib appears to be the only ALK TKI active against certain mutations that are the most difficult to inhibit, such as the G1202R mutation. Lorlatinib, therefore, has the potential to improve PFS times in the treatment-naïve ALK-positive advanced NSCLC treatment setting based on its greater potency against ALK and its broader coverage against all known single point mutations that lead to resistance to crizotinib and second generation ALK inhibitors. 29 1.2.4. Crizotinib (XALKORI®) Crizotinib, which is used in this study as the comparator arm vs the experimental arms, is the SOC used to treat NSCLC that has spread to other parts of the body and is caused by a defect in the ALK gene. To date, crizotinib has received traditional or conditional approval for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC in many countries including the United States (US), Europe (EU), and Japan. Crizotinib has also received traditionalapproval for the treatment of patients with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC in the US.CCI"

Consistent with this mechanism of action, crizotinib inhibited phosphory lation of c -MET/HGFR and selected ALK fusion or mutant variants in tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo, and RON and ROS1 in vitro. Crizotinib exhibited potent and selective growth inhibitory activity against tumor cells exhibiting translocation/inversion or selected mutations involving the ALK gene locus (EML 4-ALK or nucleophosmin [NPM]- ALK fusion variants). Oral dosing of crizotinib 250 mg twice daily (BID) showed plasma concentrations reach steady state within 15 days and remain stable. The mean apparent terminal half -life was 42hours in cance r patients after a single dose. Crizotinib is absorbed with a peak plasma concentration occurring between 4 and 6 hours under fasted condition. Crizotinib is a substrate of P -glycoprotein and is predominatel y metabolized by CYP3A4/5. Elimination of crizotinib was related to its hepatic, and possibly gastrointestinal, metabolism with a mean of 63.1% of [14C] crizotinib excreted in the feces and 22.2% in the urine (crizotinib Investigator’s Brochure [IB]). Overall, the adverse events (AEs) reported for crizotinib in clinical studies were considered generall y tolerable and manageable. For single -agent crizotinib, the most common AEs (≥20% of patients) reported as of March 2015 from 1761 (95.7%) of the 1840 patients with advanced NSCL C as treatment -related were vision disorders (60.4%), nausea (49.1%), diarrhea (48.1%), vomiting (43.9%), edema (38.1%), constipation (32.4%), elevated transaminases (30.4%), fatigue (21%), and neutropenia (20.4%). The majority of AEs were Grades 1 or 2in severit y, while treat ment -related AEs of Grades 3, 4, or 5 in severity were observed among 701 (38.1%) advanced NSCLC patients who received at least 1 dose of single -agent crizotinib 250 mg BID. The most common ( ≥2%) Grade 3 treatment -related AEs were neutropenia, elevated tr ansaminases, hypophosphatemia, ly mphopenia, leukopenia, and fatigue. The most common ( ≥1%) Grade 4 treatment -related AEs were neutropenia, and elevated transaminases. The Grade 5 treatment -related AEs were interstitial lung disease (ILD) (0.4%), death (0 .2%), and pneumonia, hepatotoxicity , lung infection, disseminated intravascular coagulation, arrh ythmia, dy spnea, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (0.1% each) (crizotinib I B). There are special warnings regarding crizotinib use that must be con sidered and are described in detail in the crizotinib IB. Fatal drug- induced hepatotoxicity occurred in less than 1% of all patients treated with crizotinib in clinical trials and usually appeared within the first 2months of therap y. Other warnings are pneumonitis/ILD and QTc prolongation, which both occurred in fewer than 2% of patients, and brady cardia which occurred in approximately 6% of patients. Specific management for these events is described in Table 5. Clinical trials of crizotinib showed high rates of objective tumor response, and the responses were rapid and durable (Studies A8081001 and A8081005).

The DR was 11.3 months with crizotinib (95% CI : 8.1, 13.8) as compared with 5.3months (95% CI : 4.1, 5.8).27 Additional improvements were seen in the use of crizotinib over chemotherapy in patient s with ROS1 -positive advanced NSCL C.28 Complete information for crizotinib may be found in the single reference safety document (SRSD) which, for this drug, is the crizotinib core data sheet (CDS). 1.2.5. Lorlatinib (PF -06463922) The lorlatinib program was initiated with the aim to develop a next -generation ALK inhibitor that is more potent than crizotinib, capable of inhibiting the catal ytic activity of ALK-resistant mutants, and able to cross the blood -brain barrier.29 Lorlatinib is a potent and selective, macrocy clic, ATP competitive small molecule inhibitor of ALK and ROS1 receptor ty rosine kinases. It is orally available, brain penetrating, and able to inhibit all clinically reported ALK kinase domain mutations responsible for resistance to crizotinib.30 This drug is currentl y in clinical development and is being investigated for the treatment of ALK -positive or ROS1- positive advanced NSCLC. L orlatinib has so far had substantial efficacy results which are described in more detail in Section 1.2.5.3 . Additional information for this compound may be found in the single reference safet y document (SRSD), which for this study is the lorlatinib IB."

Preclinical Data Lorlatinib has been studied in a variet y of in vitro and in vivo model sy stems to determine potency for inhibition of ALK or ROS1 tyrosine kinase activity , kinase selectivity , antitumor efficacy , pharmacokinetic ( PK)/pharmacod ynamic ( PD) relationships, and mechanism of action. In vitro, lorlatinib demonstrated potent, concentration -dependent inhibition of catal ytic activities of ALK, ALK mutants, and ROS1 kinases in recombinant enz yme and cell -based assay s. PF -06463922 also inhibited AL K and ROS1 dependent oncogenic functions in human NSCL C cell lines and demonstrated potent and selective growth inhibitory activit y and induced apoptosis in tumor cell lines exhibiting either non -mutant ALK and ROS1 fusion variants or mutant ALK fusions that are resistant to crizotinib treatment. In vivo, lorlatinib demonstrated marked cy toreductive activity in mice bearing tumor xenografts that express ALK or ROS1 fusion variants, including the crizotinib- resistant EML 4-ALKL1196Mor EML4 -ALKG1269Amutations. Lorlatinib treatment significantly reduced tumor size and prolonged animal survival in the orthotopic brain models (EML 4-ALK and EML4- ALKL1196M) in mice. The antitumor efficacy of lorlatinib was dose-dependent and demonstrated a strong correlation to inhibition of AL K or ROS1 phosphory lation . Detailed information on PK/PD modeling, ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism andElimination) , and CYP enzy mes inhibition can be found in the lorlatinib IB. As described in the lorlatinib IB, t he nonclinical safet y profile of PF -06463922 has been adequatel y characterized to support continued clinical trials in advanced cancer indications. 1.2.5.2. Teratogenicity Preliminary developmental toxicity studies using lorlatinib have been completed in rats and rabbits. Embry onic and fetal toxicity (including embry o lethalit y, fewer and smaller viable fetuses with some external and visceral malformations) w as observed in both species at all doses, where the low dose was projected to yield similar exposure as the RP2D of 100 mg once dail y. Based on the study results, lorlatinib induces embry onic and fetal toxicity in animals, and the current safet y measures in the clinical development program for lorlatinib to prevent pregnancy should remain in place. Additional information for this compound may be found in the Single Reference Safet y Document (SRSD), which for this study is the IB. 1.2.5.3. Clinical Data The first -in-human Study B7461001 with lorlatinib is a Phase 1/2, dose escalation, safet y, PK, PD, and anti -cancer efficacy exploration study of this investigational drug as a single agent in patients with advanced ALK -positive or ROS1 -positive NSCL C."

As of the data cutoff date of 5 May 2016 a total of 165 patients have been treated with lorlatinib, 54 in the Phase 1 portion and 111 in the Phase 2 portion. Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) Determination The Phase 1 portion of the study was designed to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for lorlatinib as a single agent in patients with advanced ALK -positive or advanced ROS1 -positive NSCL C with or without asy mptomatic CNS metastases. As part of this study , the food effect was also tested in a limited subset of patients, as well as the midazolam (MDZ) drug -drug interaction (DDI), given at steady -state, to evaluate the effect of lorlatinib on CYP3A inhibition/induction. The MTD estimate was defined as the highest dose level associated with 33% of patients experiencing a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT). Due to the discreteness of the dose levels and in the interest of patient safet y, the estimated MTD was defined as the highest dose level with a DLT rate <0.33. The primary endpoint of first -cycle DLTs was defined with pre -specified severit y based upon predicted target org an tox icity in hematologic and non-hematologic system organ classes. Additionally ,the inability to obtain sufficient drug administration due to treatment -related toxicities (but not of DL T severity ) was also considered a DLT. Importantly , the neurocognitive AEs observed in the first portion of dose escalation were late appearing and considered undesirable, even though most did not meet the definition of a DLT. Thus, the RP2D was determined based on the entiret y of the safet y, efficacy , and clinical pharmacolo gy data instead of a formal DLT and MTD determination. To date, lorlatinib has been administered across 7 different daily (QD) doses (10 mg, 25 mg, 50mg, 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg) and 3 different BID doses (35 mg BID, 75 mg BID, and 100 mg BID). A continual reassessment method (CRM) model was used in the dose escalation portion of Phase 1 to determine which doses to test based on the dose-limiting toxicities (DL Ts) observed during Cy cle 1. A food effect cohort was tested at 100 mg QD (3 patients in fed/fasted state and 3 patients in fasted/fed state). Finally , a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling cohort was tested at 100 mg QD to obtain preliminary information about lorlatinib penetration into the brain. Taken together , the 100 mg QD dose was chosen as the RP2D based on the entiret y of the safet y, efficacy , and clinical pharmacology data. The Phase 2 portion was designed to evaluate the anti- cancer activity of single -agent lorlatinib administered at the dose of 100 mg QD in different cohorts of patients with advanced ALK -positive and with advanced ROS1- positive NSCL C. This will also allow characterization of the safety , PK, and PD profiles of single -agent lorlatinib at the RP2D determined at the end of Phase 1 ."

As of the data cutoff date of 5 May 2016, the most commonly occurring treatment- related AEs across all of the doses tested were hypercholesterolemia (68.5%), CNS effects (44.4%), peripheral edema and hypertrigly ceridemia (37% each ), and peripheral neuropathy (35.2 %). The most frequentl y occurring treatment- related Grade ≥3AEs were hy percholesterolemia (11.1%) and hypertrigly ceridemia (5.6%), for which treatment with a statin is recommended at the first signs of elevated (Grade 1) cholesterol and/or trigly cerides.30 The Phase 2 portion confirmed the safet y profile of the Phase 1 portion, with the most commonly occurring treatment -related AEs including h ypercholesterolemia in 75.7% of patients, hy pertrigl yceridemia reported in 57.7% of patients, and CNS effects reported in 30.6% of patients. The most commonly reported Grade ≥3treatment -related AEs were hypercholesterolemia (15.3%) and hy pertrigly ceridemia (10.8%). There were no Grade 5treatment -related treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) reported. Temporary dosing interruptions and dose reductions were reported in 18 (33.3%) and 13(24.1%) patients, respectivel y in the Phase 1 portion and in 13 (11.7%) and 11 (9.9%) of patients respectivel y in the Phase 2 portion. Most of these delay s and reductions occurred at doses higher than 100 mg QD and the most common reasons for dosing interruption and/or dose reduction at these higher doses were h ypercholesterolemia and CNS effects. Treatment -related CNS effects hav e been observed in 24 (44.4%) Phase 1 patients and 34(31%) Phase 2 patients. The most common treatment-related CNS effects reported in the Phase 1 portion was Slow speech, occurring in 9.3% of patients. The most common treatment -related CNS effects indi vidual AEs reported in the Phase 2 portion have been Dizziness and Memory impairment, each occurring in 4.5% of patients. The CNS effects reported in both Phase 1 and Phase 2 portions have been generally considered mild (Grade 1and Grade 2) in severity a nd transient and improved upon dose delay and/or dose reduction. No Grade 4 or 5CNS effects have been reported in the Phase 1 or Phase 2 portions. A more detailed evaluation of CNS effects is ongoing in the Phase 2 portion by routine assessment of cognition, mood, and suicidality through a computerized test (using laptops provided by Cogstate) . Based on the preliminary results observed, the assessments in this randomized Phase 3 study will be limited to mood and suicidality . Treatment -related peri pheral neuropathy events have been observed in 19 (35.2%) Phase 1patients and 14 (12.6%) Phase 2 patients. The most commonly reported individual TEAE was Neuropath y peripheral, reported in 12 (22.2) Phase 1 patients and 6 (5.4%) Phase 2patients.

In addition, 1 patient had Grade 3dermatomy ositis, and 1 patient had Grade 3 lipase increased. No Grade 4 or Grade 5treatment -related SAEs were reported. There were neither any AEs that were associated with permanent treatment discontinuation, nor any treatment -related deaths (lorlatinib IB). In the Phase 2 portion, 9 patients had treatment -related SAEs , including 2 cases of acute respiratory failure of Grade 3and 4 severity , respectively ; 1case of Grade 4hypercholesterolemia ;Grade 3 gastritis, pancreatitis, pneumonia, and mental status changes ; 1case of Grade 2 presyncope ;and 1 case of Grade 1 worsening nausea.

Efficacy In terms of preliminary efficacy in Phase 1, lorlat inib demonstrated promising clinical activity , although these patients represent a heterogeneous mix of driver mutations, prior treatments, and dose levels at which they were treated. There were 25Phase 1 patients still receiving treatment as of the data cutoff date. Among 53patients evaluable for efficacy as of the data cutoff date (05 May 2016), the ORR was 47.2% and included 3(5.7%) confirmed complete responses (CR), and 22 (41.5%) confirmed partial responses (PR). In addition, 10 (18.9%) patients had stable disease (SD) as their best overall response. Thirty -nine (72%) out of 54 patients enrolled in the Phase 1 portion had CNS metastases at study entry . Of the 39 patients evaluable for intracranial response a t the time of the data cutoff date, 10 (25.6%) patients had a confirmed CR and 4 (10.3 %) patients had a confirmed PR, resulting in an intracranial ORR of 35.9%. Further, 13 (33.3%) patients had SD as their best overall response. Overall R esults Taken together, these preliminary effica cy results from Phase 1 suggest substantial anti-tumor activity and brain penetration which are being further characterized in Phase 2. Although the AE profile of lorlatinib in Phase 1 consists mostly of laboratory abnormalities, none of which were dose l imiting, there was concern over the appearance of CNS effects particularl y at doses higher than 100 mg QD, which were considered intolerable to some patients and were a cause for dose modification (ie, dosing interruption and/or dose reduction). Overall, 100mg QD was a well -tolerated dose. None of the Phase 1 patients at this dose required dose reduction. Dose delay s did occur in 44.4% of patients, in 33.3 % of them due to treatment- related AEs. These dose delay s were not attributed to CNS effects, butrather to h ypercholesterolemia or h ypertriglyceridemia, or to disease -related events."

The Ceff of 150 ng/mL was a concentration predicted to result in 80% tumor growth inhibition of the ALK G1202R resistance mutation. Further, lorlatinib demonstrated response rates of 47% (including a 36% intracranial response rate), which indicated that this compound is active both inside andoutside the brain. Taken together, the 100 mg QD dose was chosen as the RP2D based on the entirety of the safety, efficacy, and clinical pharmacology data. Lorlatinib received food and Drug (FDA) orphan drug designation for the treatment of ALK positive or ROS1 positive NSCLC in June 2015. 1.2.6. Study Rationale In response to causes of crizotinib treatment failure, next-generation ALK/ROS1 TKIs are being developed. Lorlatinib is a selective, brain penetrant ALK TKI with potent activity against ALK and ROS1 fusions, including those harboring resistance mutations. Crizotinib is the current SOC in the treatment of patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC, who have not received any prior NSCLC treatment, including molecularly targeted agents, angiogenesis inhibitors, immunotherapy, or chemotherapy). Lorlatinib has the potential to improve PFS in this setting based on its greater potency against ALK and its broad coverage against all known resistance mutations to crizotinib and second-generation ALK inhibitors. 29Additionally, lorlatinib has the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier with demonstrated clinically meaningful anti-tumor activity in patients with brain metastases after treatment with ALK inhibitors including crizotinib. 30 Lorlatinib is expected to have greater efficacy than the SOC, and thus will be tested against crizotinib in the previously untreated advanced ALK-positive NSCLC treatment setting. Additionally, competitor ALK TKI data suggest that use of more potent agents in the first-line treatment setting will lead to prolonged PFS. Both alectinib 21and ceritinib,25in fact, have shown longer median PFS times in the treatment-naïve advanced ALK-positive NSCLC population than that observed in patients with crizotinib-refractory or resistant disease. Data on resistance mutations and mechanisms are still emerging from the clinic; there may be other resistance mutations and mechanisms that will not be sensitive to ALK inhibition. To further expand on biomarker data currently being collected in the ongoing Phase 2 study, this Phase 3 study will also evaluate candidate predictive biomarkers of sensitivity or resistance to single-agent crizotinib or lorlatinib in pretreatment tumor tissue and evaluate blood-based molecular markers of response and resistance to single-agent crizotinib or lorlatinib."

Rationale for Starting Dosing Regimens Arm A: L orlatinib starting dosing regimen will be 100 mg QD which was chosen as the RP2D based on the entirety of the safety , efficacy , and clinical pharmacology data available. Arm B: Crizotinib starting dosing regimen will be 250 mg BID. This dose is the approved starting dose for treatment of ALK- positive metastatic NSCL C according to the crizotinib product label. 1.2.8. Summary of Be nefit/Risk Assessment An evaluation of the anticipated benefits and risks as required in Article 3(2)(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC (cf. Article 6(3)(b) of Directive 2001/20/EC) has been conducted. For single -agent lorlatinib, based on the non -clinical resul ts and the clinical data available to date from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, the conduct of this study with the proposed lorlatinib dosing regimen is considered justifiable. Lorlatinib treatment significantly reduced the tumor size and prolonged animal su rvival in the orthotopic brain models (EML4-ALK and EML4- ALKL1196M) in mice. The anti -tumor efficacy of lorlatinib was dose dependent and demonstrated strong correlations to inhibition of ALK or ROS1 phosphory lation . The plasma levels associated with the anti-tumor efficacy in EML 4-ALKL1196Mdependent human NSCL C cell line models w ereutilized to project target human plasma concentrations for clinical studies. Among the 53 patients who were evaluable for efficacy in the Phase 1 part of the study as of the data cutoff date, the ORR was 47.2% a nd included 3 (5.75%) confirmed complete responses (CRs), and 22 (41.5%) confirmed partial responses (PRs). Ten (10) patients (18.9%) had stable disease (SD) as their best overall response. Thirty -nine (72%) Phase 1 patients had CNS metastases at study entry . Of the 39 patients evaluable for intracranial response at the time of the data cutoff, 10 (25.6%) patients had a confirmed CR and 4 (10.3%) patients had a confirmed PR, resulting in an intracranial ORR of 35.9%. Further, 13 (33.3%) patients had SD as their best overall response. The clinical safet y data available to date with single -agent lorlatinib in patients with advanced NSCL Cwho received ≥1 previous treatment(s) have suggested an acceptable safet y profile of the compound. Most of the observed events were in line with the underlying disease. Anti -tumor activity with lorlatinib observed on both extracranial and intracranial lesions, has showed good BBB (blood brain barrier) penetra tion associated with clinically significant activity on brain metastases. The resulting potential for CNS toxicity some of which were predicted using preclinical models, has been monitored in the clinic by study ing the effect of different administration s chedules (BID vs QD) and with the use of formal neurological assessment to better characterize the changes seen. The selected administration schedules for Phase 2 and 3 study of 100 mg QD has been associated with reduction of CNS toxicity ."

These include instructions for proper management of hyperlipidemia and a list of recommended statins (see Section 5.5.1.1 ). Close safety monitoring will be performed throughout the study as outlined in the Schedule of Activities table. Peripheral neuropathy, Mood Disorders, Cognitive Disorders, Speech Disorders, Vision Disorders, Diarrhoea, Constipation, Arthralgia, Oedema, Fatigue, Weight Increased are others identified risks associated with lorlatinib administration, for which dose delay/dose reduction has been effective. For complete details of the in vitro /nonclinical/clinical studies, refer to lorlatinib current investigator’s brochure. Crizotinib is approved multinationally as the SOC for the treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC, both treatment-naïve or after failure of prior systemic therapy. Overall, the adverse events reported for crizotinib in clinical studies are considered tolerable and manageable, and the safety profile of crizotinib is well characterized and described in the XALKORI package insert. Overall, the anticipated benefit-risk profile supports the investigation of lorlatinib head-to-head against the SOC crizotinib in the patient population chosen for this study. CCI"

STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase 3, multinational, multicenter (at approximately 160 sites) , randomized, open-label, parallel 2-arm study in which approximately 280 patients with previously untreated advanced ALK-positive NSCLC were to be randomized 1:1 to receive lorlatinib monotherapy or crizotinib monotherapy according to the study design shown in Figure 1 (296 patients were actually randomized). Patients will be stratified according to (also see Section 5.1.1 ): •Presence of brain metastases (Yes vs No); •Ethnic origin (Asian vs Non-Asian). Crossover between treatment arms will not be permitted. 3.1. Study Treatment This study was to randomize approximately 280 patients in a 1:1 ratio to receive: •Arm A: Lorlatinib single agent; •Arm B: Crizotinib single agent. A cycle duration will be 4 weeks (28 days) and will always be considered 4 weeks irrespective of any dose delays/dosing interruptions or missed doses which may affect nominal days of each cycle.CCI"

Contraception Lorlatinib is teratogenic and an aneugen and can therefore cause harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Crizotinib can also cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Therefore, use of an appropriate method of contraception during treatment with these study drugs is mandatory . The investigator or his or her designee, in consultation with the participant, will confirm that the participant has selected a highly effective method of contraception for the individu al participant and his or her partner(s) from the permitted list of contraception methods (see below, Section 4.3.1.2) and will confirm that the participant has been instructed in its consistent and correct use. At time points indicated in the schedule of activities (SoA), the investigator or designee will inform the participant of the need to use a highl y effective method of con traception consistently and correctly and document the conversation and the participant’s affirmation in the participant’s chart (participants ne ed to affirm their consistent and correct use of at least one of the appropriate methods of contraception listed below, Section 4.3.1.2 ). Patients receiving lorlatinib: Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP, definition provided below, Section 4.3.1.1 )must agree to use a highl y effective nonhormonal method of contraception, because lorlatinib can render hormonal contraceptives ineffective. If a hormonal method of contraception is unav oidable, then a condom must be used in combination with the hormonal method. Contraception must be continued for at least 35 day safter completing therapy . During treatment with lorlatinib and for at least 97 day s after the final dose, male patients with WOCBP partners must agree to use a highl yeffective method of contraception, including a condom, and male patients with pregnant partners must be agreed to use condoms (see Section 4.3.1.2 ). Patients receiving crizotinib: WOCBP and male patients with WOCBP partners must agree to use an highly effective method of contraception (see Section 4.3.1.2 )throughout the study and continue to do so for at least 90days after last dose of crizotinib . Patients receiving either lorlatinib or crizotinib: All sexually active male patient s must agree to prevent potential transfer to and ex posure of pregnant partner(s) and fetus to drug through ejaculate by using a condom consistently and correctly , begin ning with the first dose of lorlatinib or crizotinib and continuing for at least 97days after the last dose of lorlatinib, or 90 day s after the last dose of crizotinib."

Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP) A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanentl y sterile (see below). If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cy cle cannot be confirmed before the first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered. Women in the following categories are notconsidered WOCBP: 1.Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: Documented h ysterectomy ; Documented bilateral salpingectomy ; Documented bilateral ooph orectom y; For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, (eg, mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity ), investigator discretion should be applied to determining stud y entry . Note: Documentation for any of the above categories can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview. The method of documentation should be recorded in the participant’s medical record for the stud y. 2. P ostmenopausal female: A postmenopausal state is defined as age 60 years or older or no menses for 12months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmeno pausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormone replacement therap y (HRT ). Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the nonhormonal appropriate contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the stud y.Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment."

Methods of Contraception 1.Established use of oral, inserted, injected o r implanted hormonal methods of contraception are allowed provided a condom is used in combination with the hormonal method. The patient must have been using that hormonal contraceptive for an adequate period of time to ensure effectiveness. 2.Correctl y placed copper -containing intrauterine device (IUD). 3.Bilateral tubal ligation/bilateral salpingectom y or bilateral tubal occlusive procedure (provided that occlusion has been confirmed in accordance with the device’s label). 4.Male condom must be used in associa tion with a female highly effective method of contraception. 5.Male sterilization with absence of sperm in the postvasectomy ejaculate. NOTE: For subjects not sexually active, sexual abstinence, defined as completely and persistently refraining from all hete rosexual intercourse (during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments) may obviate the need for contraception ONLY if this is the preferred and usual lifesty le of the subject .Investigator should assess at each visit if a change of p atient lifesty le occurred and in case reconsider , in consultation with the patient, to select anappropriate method of contraception for the individual patient and his/her partner(s) from the list of permitted contraception methods. 4.4.Sponsor’s Qualified Med ical Personnel The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the study is documented in the study contact list located in the study manual. To facilitate access to appropriatel y qualified medical personnel on stud y-related medical questions or problems, patients are provided with a contact card. The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and investigational product identifiers, patient study numbers, contact information for the investigator site, and contact details for a contact center in the event that the investigator site staff cannot be reached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the patient’s participation in the study . The contact number can also be used by investigator staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team ar e not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the established communication pathway s between the investigator site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the stud y.The contact number is not intended for use by the patient directly , and if a patient calls that number, he or she will be directed back to the investigator site."

For this study , the investigational products are lorlatinib (PF -06463922) and c rizotinib (Xalkori ), which is the reference comparator . 5.1.Allocation to Treatment The investigator’s knowledge of the treatment should not influence the decision to enroll a particular patient or affect the order in which patients are enrolled. A patient must sign an informed consent form (ICF) before being evaluated for study entry . Once a patient who has met inclusion and exclusion criteria has provided a signed ICF, allocation of patients to the treatment arms will proceed through the use of an interac tive response technology (IRT) sy stem (interactive web -based response [I WR]). The site personnel (stud y coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select information including but not limited to the user’s identification (ID) and pass word, the protocol number, and the patient number. The site personnel will then be provided with a treatment assignment, randomization number, and dispensable unit (DU) or container number when investigational product is being supplied via the I RT s ystem. The IRT sy stem will provide a confirmation report containing the subject number, randomization number, and DU or container number assigned. The confirmation report must be stored in the site’s files. The study -specific I RT reference manual will provide the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT system. Note: The IRT is the source of the patient number. The I RT sy stem will provide the patient number at the end of the first I RT patient transaction. Study treatment must be initiate d preferabl y on the randomization day but no later than 7 days after randomization. Qualified patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive: Arm A: L orlatinib monotherapy at the RP2D of 100 mg QD, administered as 4 x 25 mg oral tablets, continuousl y. Arm B: Crizotinib monotherap y at the registered starting dose of 250 mg BID, administered as 1 x 250 oral capsules/twice dail y, continuously . 5.1.1. Stratification Factors Allocation of patients will be stratified according to: Presence of brain metastases."
53,page_53,"Lorlatinib (PF 06463922) B7461006 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 4 October 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 54Yes*vs No . *Yes: means that the brain lesions can be either present and observed at patient entry or known from the patient medical history to have been present in the past even if no longer visible (eg, irradiated or surgicall y removed lesions, etc). Th e brain lesions can be either measurable or non- measurable lesions, and can be classified as either target or non- target lesions. Ethnic origin* * Asian vs non- Asian. **This refers to the actual patient race, not the place where he/she lives or is treated. If the patient’s parents are 50% Asian and 50% non -Asian, the patient must be treated as non-Asian; in case 75% Asian and 25% non-Asian, patient is treated as Asian; in case 75% non- Asian and 25% Asian patient is treated as non -Asian . This stratified ran domization will be centrally allocated across all centers via the IRT s ystem. A central randomization will be adopted due to the high number of participating centers in contrast to the anticipated small number of patients randomized at each center . 5.2.Patient Compliance For self -administration of lorlatinib or crizotin ib at home, compliance will be captured and completed b y the patient . A patient diary will be provided to the patients to aid in lorlatinib (Arm A) and crizotinib (Arm B) compliance. The diary will be maintained by the patient to include unchanged, missed, or changed lorlatinib (Arm A) or crizotinib doses (Arm B). In Arm A,patients will be required to return to the investigational site all bottles of lorlatinib at the end of each 28 -day c ycle during the planned visit at the site. The number of lorlatinib tablets remaining will be documented and recorded at each clinic visit. In Arm B,patients will be required to return to the investigational site all bottles of crizotinib at the end of each 28 -day cy cle during the planned visit at the site. The number of crizotinib capsules remaining will be documented and recorded at each clinic visit. The study site must follow up (for example, via a telephone call) with each patient on Cycle1Day 5(±3days) to confirm that the patient understands and is in compliance with lorlatinib or crizotinib dosing instructions. If needed, t he patient will be re -trained. The same follow -up process will be applied in case the dose of lorlatinib or crizotinib is modified during the treatment period. 5.3.Investigational Product Supplies Lorlatinib and c rizotinib will be supplied for the study by Pfizer Global Clinical Supply . Drug supplies will be shipped to the study sites with a Drug Shipment and Proof of Receipt form. This form will be completed and filed, as directed on the bottom of the Drug Shipment"

Patients must be instructed that should they miss a dose or vomit any time after taking a dose, they must not “make it up” with an extra dose. Instead, resume the subsequent doses as originally prescribed. Any missed dose may be taken up to 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose, otherwise it should be skipped and dosing resumed with subsequent doses as prescribed. The patient must be instructed to record all doses (including missed or vomited) in a dosing diary supplied by the site. If doses are missed or vomited, this must be indicated in the source documents and Case Record Forms (CRFs). On ECG assessment days, the lorlatinib dose should be taken in the clinic under the supervision of the study site personnel so that timing of assessments is appropriately synchronized. Since no clinically meaningful effect of food on the PK of lorlatinib has been observed, lorlatinib can be administered with or without food. 5.4.2. Crizotinib Crizotinib will be administered orally BID at approximately the same time in the morning and evening 12 hours apart on a continuous daily dosing schedule, ie, without a break in dosing in the absence of drug-related toxicity. Patients must swallow the study medication whole and must not manipulate or chew the medication prior to swallowing. A dosing card will be provided to the patients to provide guidance for the correct use of crizotinib. Patients must be instructed that should they miss a dose or vomit any time after taking a dose, they must not “make it up” with an extra dose. Instead, resume the subsequent doses as originally prescribed. Any missed dose may be taken up to 6 hours prior to the next scheduled dose, otherwise it should be skipped and dosing resumed with subsequent doses as prescribed. If a patient inadvertently takes 1 e xtra dose during a day, the patient should not take the next dose. The patient must be instructed to record all doses (including missed or vomited) in a dosing diary supplied by the site.

Oral crizotinib will be administered with at least 8 oz(240 mL) of water with or without food. 5.4.3. Treatment Duration Treatment will continue until confirmation of disease progression, patient refusal, or unacceptable toxicity , whichever occurs first. Once the patient has documented PD by BICR, patients should b e discontinued from study treatment. However, if according to the I nvestigator’s clinical judgment, a patient with evidence of PD is still experiencing clinical benefit, the patient may be eligible for continued treatment with the assigned study drug after discussion between the Investigator and Pfizer. The Investigator’s judgment should be based on the overall benefit/risk assessment (eg, intracranial response), and the patient’s clinical condition, including performance status, clinical sy mptoms, adverse events and laboratory data. In that case, the patient must undergo the same assessments foreseen during the active treatment period . As far as tumor assessments: If only extracranial progression was documented, with intracranial lesions stable or in response, intracranial assessment sshould be performed until intracranial PD; Once intracranial PD is documented no further tumor assessments are required. At completion of the study (ie,after the required number of OS events have been reported), drug suppl y for patients benefiting from therapy may continue bey ond closure of the study without further data collection. At that time, patients not progressed or still experi encing clinical benefit may be candidate sfor continued treatment, provided that the treati ng physician has determined that the benefit/risk assessment for continuing study treatment is favourable . A number of options will be considered for patients to continue to receive the study drug outside of the trial without any financial obligation to the patient. These options may include, but are not be limited to, locally reimbursed commercial drug, or donated drug or other options available at that time. A local country Pfizer representative will work with the Investigator to determine which will b e the best option for each individual patient. 5.5.Recommended Dose Modifications Every effort should be made to administer investigational products on the planned dose and schedule. In the event of significant toxicity , dosing may be delay ed and/or reduced as described below. In the event of multiple toxicities, dose modification should be based on the worst toxicity observed. Patients are to be instructed to notify their investigators at the first occurrence of an y adverse event."

Hyperlipidemia In the lorlatinib Phase 1 Study B7461001, hy percholesterolemia was the most common AE reported. Elevations in lipids usually begi n in the first few cy cles and, if statins are not introduced, can rise to Grade 3levels b y the next treatment cycle. Therefore, the suggested management is to begin a statin for Grade 1 elevations in either cholesterol or trigl ycerides and to increase th e statin dose if adequate control is not obtained, as outlined in Table 2. Members of the statin class of agents are differentially sensitive to CYP3A4, and caution should be exercised when selecting statin for management of elevated lipid levels. Pitavastatin and rosuvastatin can be used during lorl atinib treatment without dose adjustment since there is no CYP3A4 involvement in their elimination. Pravastatin, fluvas tatin and atorvastatin should be used with caution during lorlatinib treatment, and a dose adjustment of these statins may be necessary (increasing dose may be considered) . Lovastatin and simvastatin are not recommended for use during lorlatinib treatment . 5.5.1.2. PR Interval Prolongation Analy sis of ECG data from ongoing and completed human studies with lorlatinib has identified a subset of patients who exhibited ECG evidence of PR interval prolongation. The ECG changes appear limited to the PR interval with no impact on QRS or QT intervals. This impact on the PR interval is supported by preclinical animal studie s as described in the current lorlatinib IB. Guidance for management of PR interval prolongation is provided in Table 3below and examples of drug with potential PR in terval prolongation effect can be found in Appendix 5. Table 3.

Renal Cysts The development of complex renal cy sts has been reported in some pati ents with NSCL C treated with crizotinib. These cy sts may be symptomatic or as ymptomatic, and have developed from 2 and 6 months after starting crizotinib. The precise nature and significance of these cy sts is unclear; however, while no evidence of malign ancy has been found based on aspiration of cy st fluid and biopsy in the reported cases, complex renal cy sts may be associated with renal malignancy , and thus consultation with a urologist or suitable alternate medical expert is recommended. Active surveil lance with appropriate imaging (contrast -enhanced CT scanning or magnetic resonance imaging) should be performed at the time of the renal cy sts diagnosis. Investigators should also review retrospectively all CT/MRI s for an y prior occurrence of complex ren al cy sts. In addition, multitest dipstick urinalysis (should include test for protein and blood) should be performed at the time of the renal cy sts diagnosis and on Day 1of each cy cle thereafter .* Urine reflex microscopy is required whenever urine multit est dipstick is positive for blood or protein and/or if this is the local standard. *Additional analysis perlocal requirement may be performed. 5.5.2.6. Severe Visual Loss Discontinue crizotinib in patients with severe visual loss (best corrected vision less tha n 20/200 in one or both eyes). Any adverse event of Grade ≥2 of potential sight threatening (PST) or severe vision loss (SVL) that occurs in crizotinib treated patient should be treated as SAEs (Serious Adverse Events) regardless of relatedness to study drug (except for visual field defect, for which onl y Grade ≥3should be treated as SAE). Additional efforts will be made to obtain relevant clinical and diagnostic information related to all cases of Grade 4 vision loss and including an ophthalmological evaluation that should consist of best corrected visual acuity , retinal photographs, visual fields, optical coherence tomograph y (OCT), and other evaluations as appropriate for new onset of severe visual loss."

This should be captured from the time of investigational product receipt throughout the study . Even for continuous- monitoring sy stems, a log or site procedure that ensures active evaluation for excursions should be available. The intent is to ensure that the minimum and maximum temperature i s checked each business day to confirm that no excursion occurred since the last evaluation and to provide the site with the capability to store or view the minimum/maximum temperature for all non- working day s upon return to normal operations. The operati on of the temperature monitoring device and storage unit (for example, refrigerator), as applicable, should be regularl y inspected to ensure they are maintained in working order. Any excursions from the product label storage conditions should be reported to Pfizer upon discovery . The site should actively pursue options for returning the product to the storage conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible. Deviations from the storage requirements, including any actions taken, must be documente d and reported to Pfizer. Once an excursion is identified, the investigational product must be quarantined and not used until Pfizer provides permission to use the investigational product. It will not be considered a protocol deviation if Pfizer approves the use of the investigational product after the temperature excursion. Use of the investigational product prior to Pfizer approval will be considered a protocol deviation. Specific details regarding information the site should report"

Receipt of materials, door opening and closing, and other routine handling operations where the products are briefly out of the temperature range described in the labeling are not considered excursions. Site staff will instr uct patients on the proper storage requirements for take home investigational products. 5.8.Investigational Product Accountability The investigative site must maintain adequate records documenting the receipt, use, loss, or other disposition of the investiga tional product supplies. All investigational products will be accounted for using a drug accountabilit y form/record. All bottles of the investigational product (lorlatinib and crizotinib) are taken home by the patient, and must be returned to the investig ator by the patient at the end of each cy cle and at the end of the trial. The sponsor will provide instructions as to the process for drug accountabil ity in the monitoring plan. 5.8.1. Destruction of Investigational Product Supplies The sponsor or designee will provide guidance on the destruction of unused investigational product (eg, at the site). If destruction is authorized to take place at the study site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are destroy ed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy , and any special instructions provided by Pfizer, and all destruction must be adequatel y documented. 5.9.Concomitant Treatment s Concomitant treatment considered necessary for the patient’s well- being may be given at the discretion of the treating phy sician. Concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded from 28 days prior to the start of study treatment and up to 28days after the last dose of study treatment. All concomitant medications should be record ed in the CRF including supportive care drugs (eg, antiemetic treatment and proph ylaxis), and the drugs used to treat adverse events or chronic diseases, and non- drug supportive interventions (eg, transfusions). Medications intended solely for supportive c are (eg, antiemetics, analgesics, megestrol acetate for anorexia, bisphosphonates or RANK -ligands for metastatic bone disease or osteoporosis) are allowed . In case the patient is already on treatment with RANK -ligands (like denosumab) before study entry , the therapy should be at a stable dose prior to randomization. There are no prohibited therapies during the Post -Treatment Follow- Up Phase. 5.9.1. Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP Enzymes The list of food and drugs to be avoided provided below may not be full y exh austive. Consult the sponsor when in doubt whether a food or a drug falls into any of the categories below."

Arm A Lorlatinib The in vitro studies have demonstrated that CYP3A, and UGT1A4 are primarily involved in the metabolism of lorlatinib, with additio nal minor contributions from CYP2C19 and CYP2C8. I nhibition or induction of the above enzy mes may result in potential alteration of lorlatinib sy stemic exposure. Initial in vitro assessment for inhibition and induction drug -drug interaction potential indicated that lorlatinib is a time- dependent inhibitor of CYP 3A and also an inducer of CYP3A and CYP2B6. At substantially higher concentrations than those observed clinically , lorlatinib also inhibited CYP2C9 in in vitro studies. To protect patient safet y, the following cautions are provided: Lorlatinib metabolism may be inhibited by strong CYP3A inhibitors leading to a potential increase in lorlatinib toxicities. Coadministration of strong CYP3A inhibitors (eg, boceprevir, cobicistat, conivaptan, itraconaz ole, ketoconazole, and posaconazole, ritonavir alone and with danoprevir or elvitegravir or indinavir or lopinavir or paritaprevir or ombitasvir or dasabuvir or saquinavir or tipranavir, telaprevir, troleandom ycin, and voriconazole, grapefruit juice or gra pefruit/grapefruit - related citrus fruits [eg, Seville oranges, pomelos]) is not recommended and alternate medications should be considered. If the concomitant use of the strong CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the starting dose of lorlatinib from 100 mg orall y once dail y to 75 mg orally once dail y. In patients who have had a dose reduction to 75 mg orally once dail y due to adverse reactions and who initiate a strong CYP3A inhibitor, reduce the lorlatinib dose to 50 mg orally once dail y. The pati ent should be closely monitored for safety and reduction of the lorlatinib dose if necessary . If concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor is discontinued, increase the lorlatinib dose (after 3 plasma half-lives of the strong CYP3A inhibitor) to the dos e that was used before starting the strong inhibitor. Use of strong CYP3A inducers with lorlatinib is contraindicated. Lorlatinib metabolism may be induced when taking strong CYP3A inducers (eg,carbamazepine, enzalutamide, mitotane, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John’s Wort) resulting in reduced plasma concentrations. Furthermore, when lorlatinib was coadministered with rifampin, increases in AST and AL T were noted. Discontinue strong CYP3A inducers for 3 plasma half -lives of the strong CYP3A inducer prior to initiating lorlatinib and until study treatment discontinuation. In addition, use with moderate CYP3A inducers (eg, bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil) should be avoided due to the potential reduction in lorlatinib exposure. Lorlatinib induces CYP2B6 (in vitro) so concurrent use of drugs that are CYP2B6 substrates, such as bupropion andefavirenz , may have less effect. Concomitant CYP2B6 substrates should be used with caution, as the net clinical effect of lorlatinib on CYP2B6 is currentl y bein g investigated. Lorlatinib induces CYP3A (in vivo) which may lead to a decreased effect of concurrently used CYP3A substrate s (eg. hormonal contraceptives etc.)."
72,page_72,"Lorlatinib (PF 06463922) B7461006 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 4 October 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 73Coadministration of lorlatinib with CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index ( NTI) such as alfentanil, fentan yl (including transdermal patch ), astemizole*, cisapride*, cy closporine, dihy droergotamine, ergotamine, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, terfenadine* (*withdrawn from US market) is not permitted at study entry . However if it is absolutely necessary to use, sponsor approval is required and the dose of the CYP3A substrate may need to be increased. The NTI CYP3A substrate should be started only after at least 14 days of continuous lorlatinib dosing. If there is a change i n the lorlatinib dosing regimen such as a dosing interruption or dose reduction, the administration of the NTI CYP3A substrate should be stopped and resumed at a readjusted dose only after at least 14 day s of resumed lorlatinib dosing. Lorlatinib inhibit s P-glycoprotein ( P-gp) (in vitro) so concurrent use of drugs which are P -gp substrates with a narrow therapeutic index may have increased effect. The concurrent use of drugs which are P -gp substrates with narrow therapeutic index, such as digoxin is not permitted at study entry . The use of these drugs during the study is not recommended and alternate medications should be considered. If absolutely necessary to use during the study , it should be initiated following sponsor approval, and be used then with caution. The net clinical effect of lorlatinib on P -gp is currentl y being investigated. Any questions regarding the use of alternative medications should be directed to the sponsor for guidance. 5.9.1.2. Arm B Crizotinib If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications specifically prohibited during the trial, discontinuation from study therapy or medication may be required. The final decision on an y supportive therap y rests with the Investigator and/or the patient’s primary physician. However, the decision to continue the patient on study therapy or medication schedule requires the mutual agreement of the Investigator, the sponsor, and the patient. The metabolism of crizotinib is predominantly mediated by the CYP3A isozy mes in human li ver microsomes and hepatocy tes. Coadministration with drugs that are CYP3A inhibitors and inducers may change the plasma concentrations of crizotinib in humans. The concurrent use of potent CYP3A inhibitors, including but not limited to clarithrom ycin, i ndinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, troleandom ycin, saquinavir, voriconazole, and grapefruit or grapefruit juice, are not allowed in the study . The topical use of these medications (if applicable), such as 2% ketoconaz ole cream, may be allowed. The concurrent use of potent CYP3A inducers, including but not limited to carbamazepine, phenobarbital, pheny toin, rifabutin, rifampin, and St. John’s wort, are not allowed in the study ."
73,page_73,"Lorlatinib (PF 06463922) B7461006 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 4 October 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 74In vitro data indicate that the most pron ounced inhibitory potential of crizotinib was observed toward CYP3A4 (testosterone) -mediated drug metabolism. Crizotinib has minimal potential to inhibit other human CYP isoforms such as CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6. Crizotinib also showed time- depende nt inhibition of CYP3A isozy mes in human liver microsomes. In cancer patients, a mean 3.6 -fold (90% CI : 2.7-4.9) increase in the oral midazolam AUC was observed following 28 days of crizotinib dosing at 250 mg BID, suggesting that crizotinib is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A. Caution (excluding those restricted medications mentioned above) must be exercised in patients receiving crizotinib in combination with drugs that are predominantly metabolized by CYP3A such as alfentanil, cy closporine, fentany l, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus. In particular, coadministration of crizotinib with CYP3A4 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices including, but not limited to dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, pimozide, astemizole ,*cisapride ,* and terfenadine* (*withd rawn from U.S. market) must be avoided from the time of the first dose of crizotinib until treatment discontinuation 5.9.2. Other Anti -Tumor/Anti- Cancer or Experimental Drugs No additional concurrent anti-tumor treatment will be permitted while patients are receiving study treatment. Additionally , the concurrent use of select vitamins or herbal supplements is not permitted. 5.9.3. Other Prohibited Concomitant Medications and Therapies Patients are prohibited from receiving the following therapies during the treatm ent phase of this trial: Anti- cancer s ystemic chemotherapy or biological therapy . Investigational agents other than lorlatinib. Radiation therap y (with the exception noted in the Concomitant Radiotherapy Section). Other experimental pharmaceutical products. Herbal remedies with anticancer properties or known to potentially interfere with major organ function or study drug metabolism (eg, h ypericin). 5.9.4. Hematopoietic Grow th Factors Use of granulocy te colony stimulating factors should follow the current American Societ y of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines.32Patients who enter the stud y on stable doses of erythropoietin or darbepoetin may continue this treatment, and patients may start either drug during the stud y at the discretion of the investigator."

Concomitant Surgery Caution is advised on theoretical grounds for any surgical procedures during the study. The appropriate interval of time between surgery and crizotinib or lorlatinib administration required to minimize the risk of impaired wound healing and bleeding has not been determined. Stopping crizotinib or lorlatinib is recommended at least 2 days prior to surgery. Postoperatively, the decision to reinitiate crizotinib or lorlatinib treatment should be based on a clinical assessment of satisfactory wound healing and recovery from surgery, but resumed no sooner than 48 hours after surgery. 5.11. Concomitant Radiotherapy Palliative radiotherapy to specific sites of disease is permitted if considered medically necessary by the treating physician. All attempts should be made to rule out disease progression in the event of increased localized pain. If palliative radiotherapy is needed to control bone pain, the sites of bone disease should be present at baseline, otherwise, bone pain requiring radiotherapy will be considered as a sign of disease progression. Crizotinib must be stopped 24 hours before and at least 24 hours after completion of radiation therapy. In view of the current lack of data about the interaction of lorlatinib with radiotherapy, lorlatinib treatment should be interrupted during palliative radiotherapy, stopping 1 day before and resuming treatment after recovery from acute radiation toxicities to baseline. 6. STUDY PROCEDURES As applicable, all visits must occur within the pre-defined windows outlined in this protocol. 6.1. Screening Informed Consent must be obtained prior to undergoing any study specific procedures. Informed consent for use of tissue for other research or diagnostic development must also be obtained. In addition, Molecular Prescreening Informed Consent must be obtained in case the ALK status determination is not already available or has been obtainedthrough a test other than the required Ventana ALK (D5F3) IHC test performed on the Ventana ULTRA or XT platforms, are acceptable, while tests performed on the GX platform cannot be accepted. For screening procedures see the Schedule of Activities (SOA ) and ASSESSMENTS section. 6.1.1. Tumor Biospecimens Provision of an archival formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue sample is required from all patients prior to registration. The archival tumor tissue specimen may be from either a primary or metastatic lesion, and may represent tissue obtained at the time of, or subsequent to, the initial diagnosis. It would be preferable if the tumor tissue was collected within 6 months of the enrollment onto the trial to provide the most up-to-date information regarding the tumor and its microenvironment. Archived tumor tissue should be CCI"

If local country regulations do not allow for tissue block to be submitted or if a tissue block cannot be provided, sites should provide if possible at least 10 (preferably 15) unbaked glass slides each containing a ~5-micron tissue section cut serially from the same block. If archived FFPE tissue is not available, a de novo (ie, fresh) core needle tumor biopsy sample must be obtained in accord with local institutional practice for tumor biopsies. Archived or de novo tumor tissue from cytological sampling (eg, fine needle aspiration, pleural effusion, processed as FFPE block) is acceptable at screening and can be submitted. Archived or de novo tumor tissue from bone metastasis is not adequate and should not be submitted. Tumor core needle biopsies (2-3 cores) are preferred; pleural effusions (PE) cell pellets may substitute for tumor core biopsy as appropriate. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) samples (2-3 passes minimum prepared as FFPE cell block) should only be performed in the event a biopsy or pleural effusion cell pellet is not safe or feasible. The de novo biopsy samples should be formalin fixed and paraffin embedded as per routine (see Study Manual), and the resulting FFPE tissue block(s) should be submitted to the Central Laboratory. If the FFPE tissue block cannot be provided, a minimum of 15 unstained slides each containing a 5-micron tissue section cut serially from the block can substitute. Additional information on tumor biospecimen collection procedures is included in the Study Manual. 6.1.1.1. Determination of ALK Status ALK status determination will be performed at screening using the FDA-approved (in US) and the CE (Conformité Européene) marked (for EU and other countries that accept CE marking), or PMDA-approved (in Japan) Ventana ALK (D5F3) CDx IHC test performed on the Ventana ULTRA or XT platforms, performed by either local or central laboratory testing. Ventana ALK (DF53) test data performed on the GX platform cannot be accepted. Determination of ALK Status •Patients who have historical results available showing ALK-positivity through Ventana ALK D5F3 CDx test can proceed with the screening assessments. The pathology reports to verify that the approved Ventana ALK (D5F3) CDx test was performed must be prospectively collected and sent to Pfizer for patient eligibility confirmation before proceeding to randomization. Where available, Ventana ALK results are only defined as “Positive” or “Negative.”ALK reports should be provided in English and the translation must be certified.CCI"

If ALK-positivity is not confirmed, the patient is a screen failure. Re-testing time should be within the 28 days screening time •Patients who do not have historical results available must undergo a pre-screening Ventana ALK D5F3 CDx test and, if positive, can start the screening assessments. 6.2. Treatment Period For treatment period procedures, see Schedule of Activities and ASSESSMENTS section. 6.3. End of Treatment/Withdrawal and Post-Treatment Follow-Up For treatment period procedures, see Schedule of Activities and ASSESSMENTS section. 6.4. Patient Withdrawal Patients may withdraw from the study at any time at their own request, or they may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor for safety (see also the Withdrawl From the Study Due to Adverse Events Section 8.1.3 ) or behavioral reasons, or the inability of the patient to comply with the protocol required schedule of study visits or procedures at a given study site. Reasons for withdrawal of study treatment may include: •Objective disease progression (either by BICR or by Investigator). However, patients with disease progression who are continuing to derive clinical benefit from the study treatment per the Investigator will be eligible to continue with lorlatinib or with crizotinib as single agent, provided that the treating physician has determined that the benefit/risk for doing so is favorable and discussed with the sponsor; •Global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation; •Unacceptable toxicity;CCI"

Reasons for withdrawal from study follow up may include: Study terminated b y sponsor; Lost to follow -up; Refused further follow -up; Death. 6.5.Survival Follow up Visits For survival follow up procedures see Schedule of Activities table and ASSESSMENTS section. If a patient does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the patient. All attempts to contact the patient and information received during contact a ttempts must be documented in the patient’s medical record. In an y circumstance, every effort should be made to document patient outcome, if possible. The investigator should inquire about the reason for withdrawal, request the patient to return all unus ed investigational products, request that the patient return for a final visit, if applicable, and follow up with the patient regarding an y unresolved AEs. If the patient refuses further visits, the patient should continue to be followed for survival. If the patient withdraws from the study , and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed, and no additional data should be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected be fore such withdrawal of consent. 7.ASSESSMENTS Every effort should be made to ensure that the protocol -required tests and procedures are completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstances outside of the cont rol of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test. In these cases the investigator will take all steps necessary to ensure the safet y and well -being of the patient. When a protocol -required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for this and any corrective and preventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that normal processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The study team will be informed of these incidents in a timely manner."

Imaging will include chest, abdomen, and pelvis CT or MRI scans and brain MRI . CNS imaging using MRI (unless contraindicated) is required at baseline in all patients and at every tumor assessment. The response of measu rable intracranial disease (ie, lesions ≥5mm) will be assessed b y a modified version of RECIST v1.1,33see Appendix 3. Tumor assessment s are to be done at screening, then repeated every 8weeks (±1 week ) starting from randomization while on treatment and during follow-up until PD . Bone scans will be performed (or bone MRI if preferred b y Investigator) at baseline and on study only if bon y metastases are suspected. Patients with positive results on the bone scans (or bone MRI) will have these repeated every 16weeks (±1 week). Tumor assessments must continue until documented disease progression has been determined by BICR. Ifa patient continues treatment based on the investigator’s judgement of clinical benefit in spite of disease prog ression- confimed by BICR- (eg, intracranial lesions are not in progression) tumor assessment must continue to be perfo rmed every 8weeks 1week (16weeks 1week for Bone Scan/MRI if applicable ). For patients discontinuing treatment for reasons other than progression of disease, tumor assessments must be evaluated for tumor response until PD, regardless of new anti -cancer therap y. Both target and non -target lesions are to be followed using the same modality used at baseline and interval unless clinically indicated. Tumor assessments should be repeated after at least 4weeks to confirm response, and at the End of Treatment visit if more than 8 weeks have passed since the last evaluation. 7.2. Expedited Blinded Independent Central Review for Disease Progression An expedited BICR review will be performed for investigator -assessed disease progression. Upon investigator -assessed disease progression, all radiographic images collected for a patient from baseline onwards will be submitted to the BICR for expedited review (see the Study Manual for process details and maximum allow able time). Every effort should be made to keep the patient on study treatment and have all the assessments performed as per Schedule of Activities until the BI CRhas completed the radiographic image review, unless contraindicated b y the investigator . Once the patient has documented PD by BICR, patients should be discontinued from study treatment. However, if according to the I nvestigator’s clinical judgment, a p atient with evidence of PD is still experiencing clinical benefit, the patient may be eligible for continued treatment with the assigned drug after discussion between the Investigator and Pfizer. The I nvestigator’s judgment should be based on the overall benefit/risk assessment, like the intracranial effect, and the patient’s clinical condition, including performance status, clinical symptoms, adverse events and laboratory data. In this specific circumstance (eg,intracranial lesions are not in"

A request for an expedited BICR review may also be triggered b y Pfizer upon notification of cases th at have been reported as PD b y Parexel during the irtimepoint review, but not submitted for global expedited review yet since not identified as PD cases by the investigator . 7.3.Pregnancy Testing For female patients of childbearing potential, a serum or urine pregnancy test, with sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL will be performed on 2 occasions prior to starting administration of study treatment, once at the start of screening and once at the baseline visit immediately before starting the investigational prod uct administration. Following a negative serum pregnancy test result at screening, appropriate contraception must be commenced and another negative serum or urine pregnancy test result will then be required at the baseline visit before the patient may receive the investigational product. Urine pregnancy tests will also be routinel y repeated at every treatment cycle during the active treatment period, at the end of study treatment, and additionally whenever 1 menstrual cy cle is missed or when potential pre gnancy is otherwise suspected. In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy , the patient will be withdrawn from administration of investigational product but may remain in the study . Additional pregnancy tests may also be undertaken if requested by Institutional Review Board (IRBs)/ECs or if required by local regulations. 7.4.Safety Assessments Safety assessments will include collection of AEs, SAEs, vital signs and phy sical examination, 12 lead ECGs, echocardiogram/MUGA, laboratory assessments, including pregnancy tests and verification of concomitant treatments. Ophthalmologic examinations will be performed in all patients. Assessment for mood and suicidal ideation and behavior will also be performed (see Schedule of Activities ). 7.4.1. Adverse Events Assessment of AEs will include the t ype, incidence, severit y (graded b y the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] version 4.03) timing, seriousness, and relatedness. Adverse events that occur du ring the study , including baseline signs and symptoms, will be recorded on the AE CRF page. 7.4.2. Laboratory Safety Assessment Hematology , blood chemistry , and urinaly sis will be collected at the time points described in the Schedule of Acti vities table and anal yzed at local laboratories. They may also be performed when clinically indicated and relevant results reported in the CRF as ‘unplanned visits’. The required laboratory tests are listed in Appendix 4. Local laboratory certification(s) and reference ranges should be provided to the sponsor prior to st udy patient screening activity ."

Vital Signs and Physical Examinations Patients will have a physical examination to include major body systems, body weight, blood pressure, pulse rate, assessment of ECOG performance status, and height (height will be measured at screening only) at the time points described in the Schedule of Activities . Blood pressure and pulse rate should be taken with the patient in the seated position after the patient has been sitting quietly for at least 5 minutes. 7.4.4. (12-Lead) Electrocardiograms A triplicate 12-lead (with a 10-second rhythm strip) tracing will be used for all ECG assessments, except for ECG at Day 1 of Cycle ≥3, which will be single readings according to Schedule of Activities . All patients require a triplicate ECG measurement at screening. On treatment ECGs will be performed as outlined in the SOA table. At each time point which requires a triplicate reading per SoA, 3 consecutive 12 lead ECGs will be performed approximately 2 minutes apart (or within 10 minutes, whichever is appropriate) to determine mean QTc (average of triplicates). Clinically significant findings seen on subsequent ECGs should be recorded as adverse events. In case of QTc >500 msec (ie,CTCAE Grade >2), ECG must be reviewed by qualified personnel at the site as soon as the finding is made, including verifying that the machine reading is accurate and that the Fridericia correction formula is applied. If the manual reading verifies a rate corrected QTc of >500 msec, repeat ECG should be immediately performed at least two times approximately 2 to 4 minutes apart. An electronic reading of prolonged QTc must be confirmed by manual reading. Prior to conclusion that an episode of prolongation of the QTc is due to study drug, thorough consideration should be given to potential precipitating factors (eg, change in patient clinical condition, effect of concurrent medication, electrolyte disturbance) and possible evaluation by a specialist. If QTc reverts to less than 500 msec, and in the judgment of investigator and sponsor is determined to be due to a cause other than study drug, treatment may be continued with regular ECG monitoring. If a patient experiences PR interval prolongation >200 msec or second-degree or third-degree AV block, while on treatment with lorlatinib, refer to Section 5.5.1.2 . If a patient experiences bradycardia while on crizotinib, refer to the general recommendations for crizotinib dose modification in Section 5.5.2. If patient experiences a cardiac or neurologic AE (specifically syncope, dizziness, seizures, or stroke), triplicate ECGs should be obtained at time of the event. If the mean QTc is prolonged (>500 msec), or new or worsened AV block is noted, then ECGs should be re- evaluated by a qualified person at the institution for confirmation and repeated as clinically indicated.

Echocardiograms/MUGA Scans In order to monitor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), an echocardiogram or MUGA will be performed at the time point described in the Schedule of Activities . The same method should be used at each time point. 7.4.6. Transthoracic echocardiogram (France and Germany only) Two (2) patients receiving lorlatinib under compassionate use programme in France have been reported to have Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH), which have been diagnosed in absence of right heart catheterization. However, in one of these patients, PAH was a pre-existing condition and confounding factors were present in the other patient. In addition, 3 cases of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) (1 not-related SAE, 1 not-related non-SAE, and 1 related non-SAE) were reported in study B7461001. No other cases were reported in approximately 900 patients treated with lorlatinib and no findings associated with pulmonary hypertension have been observed in lorlatinib nonclinical studies. Although the current evidence does not indicate PH is a risk associated with lorlatinib treatment, investigators in Germany and France have been required, as requested by French (Agence National de Sécurité du Medicament et des produits de santé- ANSM) and German (Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte-BfArM) health authorities, to implement appropriate risk-reduction measures, including a trans thoracic echocardiogram (TTE) along the study treatment period for patients enrolled in these two countries. In order to monitor pulmonary blood pressure, the condition of the heart valves, and ventricular motion, transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be performed at the time points described in the Schedule of Activities . In this respect, the benefits/risks of including patients with cardiopulmonary disorders/comorbidities or risk factors should be carefully considered. In addition: •A prompt TTE must be performed in the event of symptoms or signs suggesting PH, and all other explorations pursuant to PH diagnosis guidelines. •Should PH occur during treatment, following multidisciplinary discussions involving a PH specialist (cardiologist or pulmonologist), consider dose reductions or even permanently discontinuing lorlatinib in the absence of haemodynamic and clinical recovery. •Information must be provided to patients treated with lorlatinib on the new safety finding, with the recommendation to seek immediate medical attention in the event of signs suggesting PH (particularly dyspnoea and fatigue).CCI"

CSF Collection for Lorlatinib and Crizotinib Concentration Measurements Diagnostic CSF analysis is mandatory for patients with suspected or confirmed leptomeningeal disease/carcinomatous meningitis (LMD/CM) not visualized on MRI (optional for the remaining patients). To be performed at baseline, and if clinically safe and feasible, further CSF cytology will be performed as clinically indicated to assess anti-tumor response and to determine lorlatinib or crizotinib concentrations. If a patient is required to undergo a lumbar puncture while on trial, an additional ~5 mL sample of CSF should be collected for determining Crizotinib and its metabolite (Arm B) concentrations. If a CSF sample is collected, at approximately the same time. The CSF concentrations of crizotinib, other potential metabolites may be determined using a validated or non-validated method.

86,page_86,"Lorlatinib (PF 06463922) B7461006 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 4 October 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 87Patients must complete all EORTC QL Q-C30, EORTC QL Q-LC13 and EQ -5D- 5L self-assessment questionnaires in the clinic and these cannot be taken home. All scheduled assessments of the EORTC QL Q-C30, EORTC QLQ -LC13, and EQ -5D- 5Lmust be completed in the clinic prior to any other study or medical procedures. EORTC QLQ -C30 and QLQ -LC13: The EORTC QLQ -C30 (Version 3.0) is a published, validated, and self -administered PRO questionnaire.34The EORTC QL Q-C30 consists of 30 questions and includes 5 functional scales (ph ysical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); a global health status/global quality of life scale; 3symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting); and 6single items that assess additional sy mptoms (dy spnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, and diarrhea) and financial impact. All scales and single item measures range in score from 0 to 100. Higher scores on the functional scales represent higher levels of functioning. Higher scores on the global health status/quality of life scale represent higher health status/quality of life. Higher scores on s ymptom scales/items represent a greater pr esence of symptoms. The EORTC QLQ -LC13 is the lung cancer -specific module of the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire.35The EORTC QL Q-LC13 consists of 13 questions and includes 1multi- item scale and 9 single items assessing s ymptoms (dy spnea, cough, haemopt ysis, and site -specific pain), side effects (sore mouth, dy sphagia, peripheral neuropathy , and alopecia), and pain medication use. Similar to the EORTC QL Q-C30, higher scores are reflective of a greater presence of s ymptoms. The EORTC QLQ -C30 and EORTC QL Q-LC13 will be administered as noted on the SOA table. Both the EORTC QLQ- C30 and QLQ -LC13 module srequire about 15 minutes to complete. EQ-5D- 5L: The EuroQol EQ -5D- 5L is a patient -completed questionnaire designed to assess health status in terms of a single index value or utility score.36,37There are 2 components to the EuroQol EQ-5D- 5L: a descriptive sy stem in which individuals rate their level of problems (none, slight, moderate, severe, extreme/unable) in 5 areas (mobility , self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety /depression) and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) in which patients rate their overall health status from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable). Published weights are available that allow for t he creation of a single summary score. TheEuroQol EQ -5D- 5L questionnaire will be administered as noted on the SOA table. The amount of time for a patient to complete the EQ -5D-5L is estimated to be about 2 minutes. 7.10. Assessment of Moo d Anassessment of mood will be administered to patients via the Beck Depression I nventory -II scale at the time points described in the Schedule of Activities table. This is a 21 -item self-report scale, with each item rated b y patien ts on a 4 point scale (ranging from 0 -3). The scale includes items capturing mood (loss of pleasure, sadness, irritability ), suicidal ideation, and cognitive signs (punitive thoughts, self - criticism, self- dislike, pessimism poor concentration) as well as somatic signs (appetite, sleep, fatigue, libido)."

Assessment of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior To assess suicidal ideation behaviors, the Columbia Suicide Severit y Rating Scale (C-SSRS)37will be administered to patients at the time points described in the Schedule of Activities table. The C -SSRS is a unique, simple and short method of assessing both beha vior and ideation that tracks all suicidal events and provides a summary of suicidality . It assesses the lethalit y of attempts and other features of ideation (frequency, duration, controllability , reasons for ideation ,and deterrents), all of which are si gnificantly predictive of completed suicide. 7.12. Ophthalmologic Examinations Ophthalmologic examinations for both right and left ey es will be performed at screening for all patients enrolled and should be performed b y an ophthalmologist. Ophthalmologic examinations should be repeated during the course of the study whenever a vision disorder AE is observed or CTCAE grade change occurs from a previous visit. Best Corrected Visual Acuity and Refraction Best corrected visual acuity will be assessed b y using a standard wall or projection chart (Snellen, or another validated scale, provided that th e result is converted to Snellen value) before implementing any procedures that can affect vision (eg, pupil dilation). The same chart will be used throughout the study for a specific patient, and the right ey e should be tested first. The refractive error also will be determined. The ophthalmologist should ensure that patients are seated comfortably and that they do not move their head forward or backward during t esting. Patients will be told that the chart contains only letters. Biomicroscopy Slit-lamp biomicroscopy will be performed without dilation of the pupil and should precede the administration of an y pupil -dilating agent for ophthalmoscopy . Any abnormalit ies (including severity ) of the eyelids, conjunctivae, sclera e, cornea s, anterior chamber s, irises , or lens will be recorded. Fundoscopy Fundoscop y will be performed after pupillary dilation to examine the vitreous body, retina macula, retina non -macula ( peripheral), optic nerve head , fundus and optic disc notching . 8.ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING 8.1.Requirements The table below summarizes the requirements for recording safet y events on the CRF and for reporting safety events on the Clinical Trial (CT) Serious Adver se Event (SAE) Report Form to Pfizer Safety . These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; (2) non-serious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupa tional exposure."
88,page_88,"Lorlatinib (PF 06463922) B7461006 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 4 October 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 89Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the CT SAE Report Form to Pfizer Safety Within 24 Hours of Awareness SAE All All Non-serious AE All None Exposure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposureAll (regardless of whether associated with an AE), except occupational exposureExposure during pregnancy , exposure via breastfeeding, occupational exposure (regardless of whether associated with an AE) All observe d or volunteered events regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to the investigational product(s) will be reported as described in the following paragraphs. Events listed in the table above that require reporting to Pfizer Safet y on the CT SAE Report Form within 24 hours of awareness of the event by the investigator are to be reported regardless of whether the event is determined by the investigator to be related to an investigational product under study . In particular, if the SAE is fatal or life -threatening, notification to Pfizer Safety must be made immediately , irrespective of the extent of available event information. This time frame also applies to additional new (follow -up) information on previously forwarded reports. I n the rare situation that the investigator does not become immediately aware of the occurrence of an event, the investigator must report the event within 24 hours after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the event. For each event, the investigator must pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as an SAE (see the Serious Adverse Events section below). In addition, the investigator may be requested b y Pfizer Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion. This information is more detailed than that recorded on the CRF . In general, this will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causalit y. An y information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications and illne sses, must be provided. I n the case of a subject death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety . An y pertinent additional information must be reported on the CT SAE Report Form; additional source doc uments (eg, medical records, CRF, laboratory data) are to be sent to Pfizer Safet y ONLY upon request. As part of ongoing safet y reviews conducted b y the sponsor, an y non -serious AE that is determined b y the sponsor to be serious will be reported by the spo nsor as an SAE. To assist in the determination of case seriousness, further information may be requested from the investigator to provide clarity and understanding of the event in the context of the clinical study ."
89,page_89,"Lorlatinib (PF 06463922) B7461006 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 4 October 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 908.1.1. Additional Details on Recording Adverse Events on the CRF All events detailed in the table above will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the CRF. I t should be noted that the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the same as the AE page of the CRF. When the same data are coll ected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. AEs should be recorded using concise medical terminology and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the CT SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information. 8.1.2. Eliciting Adverse Event In formation The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported b y the stud y patient /legally acceptable representative . In addition, each stud y patient /legall y acceptable representative will be questioned ab out the occurrence of AEs in a non-leading manner. 8.1.3. Withdrawal From the Study Due to Adverse Events (Also See Section 6.4Patient Withdrawal) Withdrawal due to AEs should be distinguished from withdrawal due to other causes, according to the definition of AE noted below, and recorded on the CRF. When a subje ct withdraws from the study because of an SAE, the SAE must be recorded on the CRF and reported, as appropriate, on the CT SAE Report Form, in accordance with the Requirements section above. 8.1.4. Time Period for Collecting AE/SAE Information The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (“active collection period”) for each patient begins from the time the patient provides informed consent, which is obta ined before the patient’s participation in the study (ie, before undergoing an y study -related procedure and/or receiving investigational product), through and including a minimum of 28 calendar days after the last administration of the investigational prod uct. For subjects who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure status is determined. 8.1.4.1. Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety All SAEs occurring in a patient during the active collection period are reported to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form. SAEs occurring in a patient after the active collection period has ended are reported to Pfizer Safety if the investigator becomes aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator believes have at least a reasonable possibili ty of being related to investigational product must be reported to Pfizer Safety . Follow up by the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to th e investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment."
90,page_90,"Lorlatinib (PF 06463922) B7461006 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 4 October 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 91If a patient begins a new anticancer therapy, SAEs occurring during the above -indicated active collection period must still be reported to Pfizer Safety irrespective of any intervening treatment. 8.1.4.2. Recording Non -Serious AEs and SAEs on the CRF During the active collection period, both non-serious AEs and SAEs are recorded on the CRF. Follow -up by the investigator may be required until the event or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator, and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. If a patient begins a new anticancer therap y, the recording period for non -serious AEs ends at the time the new treatment is started; however, SAEs must continue to be recorded on the CRF during the above -indicated active collection period. 8.1.5. Causality Assessment The investigator’s assessment of causalit y must be provided for all AEs (serious and non-serious); the investigator must record the causal relationship on the CRF, and report such an asses sment in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements, if applicable. An investigator’s causalit y assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE; generall y the facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship should be provided. If the investigator does not know whether or not the investigational product caused the event, then the event will be handled as “related to investigational product” f or reporting purposes, as defined b y the sponsor. If the investigator's causality assessment is “unknown but not related” to investigational product, this should be clearl y documented on study records. In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with study procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the CT SAE Report Form and in accordance with the SAE reporting requir ements. 8.1.6. Sponsor’s Reporting Requirements to Regulatory Authorities AE reporting, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, will be carried out in accordance with applicable local regulations. 8.2.Definitions 8.2.1. Adverse Events An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a study subject administered a product or medical device; the event need not necessaril y have a causal relationship with the treatment or usage. Examples of AEs include, but are not limited to: Abnormal test findings; Clinically significant signs and sy mptoms;"
91,page_91,"Lorlatinib (PF 06463922) B7461006 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 4 October 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 92Changes in ph ysical examination findings; Hypersensitivity ; Drug abuse; Drug dependency . Additionally , AEs may include signs and s ymptoms resulting from: Drug overdose; Drug withdrawal; Drug misuse; Drug interactions; Extrava sation; Exposure during pregnancy (EDP); Exposure via breastfeeding; Medication error; Occupational exposure. Worsening of signs and symptoms of the malignancy under study should be recorded as AEs in the appropriate section of the CRF. Disease progressio n assessed b y measurement of malignant lesions on radiographs or other methods should not be reported as AEs. 8.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings Abnormal objective test findings should be recorded as AEs when an y of the following conditions are met: Test result is associated with accompan ying symptoms; and/or Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention; and/or Test result leads to a change in stud y dosing (outside of an y protocol -specified dose adjustments) or discontinuation fr om the study , significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therap y; and/or Test result is considered to b e an AE b y the investigator or sponsor."
92,page_92,"Lorlatinib (PF 06463922) B7461006 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 4 October 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 93Merel y repeating an abnormal test, in the absence of an y of the above conditions, does not const itute an AE. An y abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require recording as an AE. 8.2.3. Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence at any dose that: Results in death; Is life -threatening (immediate risk of death); Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity (substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions); Results in conge nital anomaly /birth defect. Or that is considered to be: An important medical event. Medical and scientific judgment is exercised in determining whether an event is an important medical event. An important medical event may not be immediately life-threate ning and/or result in death or hospitalization. However, if it is determined that the event may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other AE outcomes, the important medical event should be reported as serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Progression of the malignancy under s tudy (including signs and s ymptoms of progression) should not be reported as an SAE unless the outcome is fatal within the active collection period. Hospitalization due to signs and s ymptoms of disease progression should not be reported as an SAE. If the malignancy has a fatal outcome during the study or within the active collection period, then the event leading to death must be recorded as an AE on the CRF, and as an SAE with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade 5 (see the Severit y Assessment section). 8.2.4. Hospitalization Hospitalization is defined as an y initial admission (even less than 24 hours) in a hospital or equivalent healthcare facility , or any prolongation of an existing admission. Admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care unit (eg, from the psy chiatric wing to a medical floor, medical floor to a coronary care unit, or neurological floor to a tubercu losis unit). An emergency room visit does not necessarily constitute a hospitalization; however, the event leading to the emergency room visit is assessed for medical importance."
93,page_93,"Lorlatinib (PF 06463922) B7461006 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 4 October 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 94Hospitalization does not include the following: Rehabilitation facilities; Hospice facilities; Respite care (eg, caregiver relief); Skilled nursing facilities; Nursing homes; Same -day surgeries (as outpatient/same -day/ambulatory procedures). Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization in the absence of a precipitating clini cal AE is not in itself an SAE. Examples include: Admission for treatment of a preexisting condition not associated with the development of a new AE or with a worsening of the preexisting condition (eg, for workup of a persistent pretreatment laboratory abnormality ); Social admission (eg, subject has no place to sleep); Administrative admission (eg, for yearly physical examination); Protocol -specified admission during a stud y (eg, for a procedure required by the stud y protocol); Optional admission not asso ciated with a precipitating clinical AE (eg, for elective cosmetic surgery ); Hospitalization for observation without a medical AE; Preplanned treatments or surgical procedures. These should be noted in the baseline documentation for the entire protocol an d/or for the individual subject; Admission exclusively for the administration of blood products. Diagnostic and therapeutic noninvasive and invasive procedures, such as surgery , should not be reported as SAEs. However, the medical condition for which the procedure was performed should be reported if it meets the definition of an SAE. For example, an acute appendicitis that begins during the reporting period should be reported if the SAE requirements are met, and the resulting appendectomy should be record ed as treatment of the AE."

A severe event is not necessarily an SAE. For example, a headache may be severe (interferes significantly with the subject's usual function) but would not be classified as serious un less it met one of the criteria for SAEs, listed below . GRADE Clinical Description of Severit y 0 No change from normal or reference range (This grade is not included in the Version 4.03 CTCAE document but may be used in certain circumstances.) 1 MILD ad verse event 2 MODERATE adverse event 3 SEVERE adverse event 4 LIFE -THREATENING consequences; urgent intervention indicated 5 DEATH RELATED TO adverse event 8.4.Special Situations 8.4.1. Protocol -Specified Serious Adverse Events There are no protocol -specified SAEs in this study with exception of those mentioned at Section 5.5.2.6 Severe Visual L oss for Crizotinib Patients. All SAEs will be reported to Pfizer Safety by the investigator as described in previous sections, and will be handled as SAEs in the safet y database. 8.4.2. Potential Cases of Drug- Induced Liver Injury Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determ ined by elevations in transaminases) are termed “tolerators,” while those who show transient liver injury , but adapt are termed “adaptors.” In some subjects, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome. These subjects fail to adapt and therefore are ""susceptible"" to progressive and serious liver injury , commonly referred to as drug -induced liver injury (DILI). Subjects who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 times the upper limit of normal ( ×ULN) should be monitor ed more frequently to determine if they are an “adaptor” or are “susceptible.” In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and/or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) precede total bilirubin (TBili) elevations (>2 ×ULN) by seve ral days or weeks. The increase in TBili ty picall y occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated above 3 ×ULN (ie, AST/AL T and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab sample). In rare instances, b y the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have decreased. This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI. Therefore, abnormal elevations in either AST OR AL T in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy ’s law criter ia) cases and should alway s be"
95,page_95,"Lorlatinib (PF 06463922) B7461006 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 4 October 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 96considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the subject’s individual baseline v alues and underl ying conditions. Subjects who present with the following laboratory abnormalities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases to definitivel y determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values: Subjects with AST/AL T and TBili baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR ALT values >3 ×ULN AND a TBili value >2× ULN with no evidence of hemol ysis and an alkaline phosphatase value <2×ULN or not available; For subje cts with baseline AST OR ALT ORTBili values above the ULN, the following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline: Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the norm al range: AST or ALT values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 ×ULN; or >8 ×ULN (whichever is smaller). Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from baseline value b y an amount of at least 1 × ULN orif the value reache s >3 × ULN (whichever is smaller). Rises in AST/AL T and TBili separated b y more than a few weeks should be assessed individually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy’s l aw case should be reviewed with the sponsor. The subject should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferabl y within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history , and physical assessment. The possibility of hepatic neoplasia (primary or secondary ) should be considered. In addition to repeating measurements of AST and AL T and TBili, laboratory tests should include albumin, creatine kinase (CK), direct and indirect b ilirubin, gamma -glutam yl transferase (GGT), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), total bile acids, alkaline phosphatase and acetaminophen drug and/or protein adduct levels. Consideration should also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology . A detailed history , including relevant information, suc h as review of ethanol, acetaminophen (either b y itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over -the-counter medications) , recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family history , sexual history , travel history , history of co ntact with a jaundiced person, surgery , blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be"

Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) may be warranted. All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria of AST/AL T and TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy ’s law) cases if no other reason for the liver function tests (LFT) abnormalities has y et been found. Such potential DILI (Hy’s law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities. A potential DILI (Hy’s law) case becomes a confirmed case onl y after all results of reasonable investigations have been received and have excluded an alternative etiology . 8.4.3. Exposure to the Investigational Product During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure Expo sure to the investigational product under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding and occupational exposure are reportable to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of investigator awareness. 8.4.3.1. Exposure During Pregnancy For both unapproved/unlicensed products and for marketed products, an exposure during pregnancy (EDP) occurs if: A female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant either while receiving or having been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product; or the female becomes or is found to be pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational product. An example of environmental exposure would be a case involving direct contact with a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a nurse reports that s he is pregnant and has been exposed to chemotherapeutic products). A male has been exposed (eg, because of treatment or environmental exposure) to the investigational product prior to or around the time of conception and/or is exposed during his partner’s pregnancy ."
97,page_97,"Lorlatinib (PF 06463922) B7461006 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 4 October 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 98If a subject or subject’s partner becomes or is found to be pregnant during the subject’s treatment with the investigational product, the investigator must report this information to Pfizer Safety on the CT SAE Report Form and an EDP supplement al form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. In addition, the investigator must submit information regarding environmental exposure to a Pfizer product in a pregnant woman (eg, a subject reports that she is pregnant and has been exposed to a cytotoxic product by inhalation or spillage) to Pfizer Safet y using the EDP supplemental form. This must be done irrespective of whether an AE has occurred and within 24 hours of awareness of the exposure. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy). Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregna ncy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer Safet y of the outcome as a follow -up to the initial EDP supplemental form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrit y of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be specified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrit y of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless pre-procedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomal y and the findings are reported). If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy , spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomal y [in a live-born bab y, a te rminated fetus, an intrauterine fetal demise, or a neonatal death]), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safet y as SAEs follows: Spontaneous abortion includes miscarriage and missed abortion; Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality , as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the investigational product. Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the sponsor. Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case- by-case basis (eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify developmental delay s). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the subject with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that the subject was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner."

Exposure During Breastfeeding Scenarios of exposure during breastfeeding must be reported, irrespective of the presence of an associated SAE, t o Pfizer Safet y within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form. An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specifically approved for use in breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug’s administration, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding. 8.4.3.3. Occupational Exposure An occupational exposure occurs when, during the performance of job duties, a person (whether a healthcare professional or otherwise) gets in unplanned direct contact with the product, which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE. An occupational exposure is reported to Pfizer Safety within 2 4 hours of the investigator’s awareness, using the CT SAE Report Form, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE.

DATA ANALYSIS/STATIS TICAL METHODS Detailed methodology for summary and statistical anal yses of the data collected in this study is outlined here and further detailed in a statistical anal ysis plan (SAP), which will be maintained by the sponsor. The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. In order to provide overall estimates of treatment effect, data will be pooled across centers. The ‘center’ factor will not be considered in statistical models or for subset anal yses due to the high number of participating centers in contrast to the anticipated small number of patients randomized/treated at each center. 9.1.Sample Size Determination The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate that lorlatinib (Arm A) is superior to crizotinib (Arm B) in prolonging PFS by BICR assessment per RECI ST v1.1. A key secondary objective of the study is to demonstrate that lorlatinib is superior to crizotinib in prolonging OS. The study is designed to test H 0: HR PFS≥1vs. H A: HR PFS<1, where HR PFSis the hazard ratio (Arm A/Arm B) of PFS . Approximately 280 patients (140 in each arm) were to be randomized using a 1:1 ratio stratified by presence of brain metastases and ethnic origin .As of 28 February , 2019 enrollment was closed with 296 patients randomized. One hundred sevent y seven (177)PFS events will be required to have at least 90% power to detect a HR of 0.611 using a one -sided stratified log -rank test at a significance level of 0.025 (one-sided) , and a 2 -look group -sequential design with a Lan-DeMets (O’Brien- Fleming) α-spending function to determine the efficacy boundaries , The planned sample size was determined based on the assumption of a HR of 0.611 under the alternative h ypothesis (under an exponential model, assumes median PFS of 11 months in the crizotinib arm and 18 months in the lorlatinib arm). The sampl e size further assumed a 15% drop-out rate within each treatment arm at 30 months, a non -uniform patient accrual over approximately 15months and follow -up after the last patient is randomized of approximately 18months."
100,page_100,"Lorlatinib (PF 06463922) B7461006 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 4 October 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 101This sample size will also allow comparison of OS between the 2 treatment arms, provided that superiority of lorlatinib over crizotinib with respect to PFS has been demonstrated. If the true HR is 0.70 under the alternative hypothesis (under an exponential model, assumes median OS of 48 months on the crizotinib arm and 68.6 months on the lorlatinib arm), a total of 198 deaths will be required to have 70% power using a one-sided stratified log-rank test at a significance level of 0.025 (one-sided), and 3-look group-sequential design with a Lan-DeMets (O’Brien-Fleming) α-spending function to determine the efficacy boundaries. These calculations further assumed a 15% drop-out rate for OS on either treatment arm at 120 months, and a follow-up of approximately 110 months after the last patient is randomized. The study will be considered positive if the primary objective is met as assessed by the stratified log-rank test for the primary PFS endpoint. 9.2. Analysis Sets 9.2.1. Full Analysis Set The full analysis (FA) set will include all patients who are randomized. Patients will be classified according to the treatment assigned at randomization. The FA set will be the primary population for evaluating all efficacy endpoints and patient characteristics. 9.2.2. Safety Analysis Set The safety analysis (SA) set will include all patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug. Patients will be classified according to the treatment assigned at randomization unless the incorrect treatment(s) are received throughout the dosing period, in which case patients will be classified according to the first study treatment received. The SA set will be the primary population for evaluating treatment administration/compliance and safety. Efficacy endpoints may be assessed in this population as well. 9.2.4. PRO Analysis Set The PRO analysis set is defined as patients from the FA set who completed a baseline (last PRO assessment prior to randomization day) and at least 1 post-baseline PRO assessment. The PRO analysis set will be the primary population for the analysis of change from baseline scores and time to deterioration (TTD) in patient-reported pain, dyspnea, or cough.CCI"

Biomarker Analysis Set The biomarker anal ysis set will include all patients in the SAset that have at least 1screening biomarker asse ssment. A nalysis sets will be defined separately for blood -based and tumor tissue -based biomarkers and will also be defined separatel y for non -paired and paired biomarkers. 9.3.Efficacy Analysis All efficacy analy ses will be performed on the FA set unless ot herwise specified. All analy ses will be performed by using SAS®Version 9.1.3 or higher. Radiographic images and clinical information collected on stud y will be reviewed b y a BICR. BICR assessment will be used for the primary anal ysis of PFS and for all secondary endpoints based on radiological assessments of tumor burden (ie, OR, DR, TTR, I C-OR, IC-DR, I C-TTR and IC -TTP). PFS and OR will also be derived using the local radiologist’s/investigator’s assessment. All planned sensitivity analy ses will be described in the SAP. 9.3.1. Analysis of the Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is PFS which is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documentation of objective progression of disease or death due to any cause, whichever oc curs first. PFS data will be censored on the date of the last adequate tumor assessment (prior to any new anti -cancer treatment) for patients who do not have an event (PD or death), for patients who start new anti -cancer treatment prior to an event, or for patients with an event after two or more missing tumor assessments. Patients who do not have a baseline tumor assessment, or who do not have an y post -baseline tumor assessments will be censored on the day of randomization, with a duration of 1 day, unles s death occurred on or before the time of the second planned tumor assessment, in which case the death will be considered an event. The primary anal ysis of PFS will be performed on the FA set, based on BICR assessment. A stratified log -rank test (one -sided) will be used to compare PFS time between the 2 treatment arms at the interim and/or final anal yses with the overall significance level preserved at 0.025 (one-sided) . The stratification factors used to conduct the stratified log -rank test for the prima ry analy sis will include the two r andomization stratification factors and additionally , as a sensitivity anal ysis, may include other factors, such as baseline ECOG PS, that will be specified in the SAP . PFS times associated with each treatment arm will be summarized using the Kaplan -Meier method and display ed graphically where appropriate. Confidence intervals (CIs) for the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles will be reported. The Cox proportional hazards model will be fitted to compute the treatment HRs and the corresponding 95% CIs."

Additionally , a Cox regression model, stratified for baseline stratification factors, will be used to explore the potential influences of the other factors on the primary PFS endpoint. 9.3.2. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints All analy ses will be performed using the FA set. The anal ysis of PFS will be repeated based on the Investigator’s assessment. The anal yses of other tumor -related endpoints will be based on the BICR assessment, with the exception of OR that will be based both on BICR and on the investigator’s assessment. 9.3.2.1. Overall Survival Overall Survival (OS) is defin ed as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. Patients last known to be alive will be censored at date of last contact. OS will be hierarchically tested for significance at the time of PFS interim/final anal ysis, provided the primary endpoint, PFS, is statistically significant at that anal ysis. In this case, OS will also be tested at 70% of the OS events (provided the first interim analy sis of OS is not statistically significant) and at the OS final analy sis (provided both i nterim analy ses of OS are not statistically significant). A stratified log -rank test (one sided; using the same stratification factors used for PFS anal ysis) will be used at the interim and/or final anal yses with the overall significance level preserved a t 0.025 (one sided). OS time associated with each treatment arm will be summarized using the Kaplan -Meier method and display ed graphicall y where appropriate. CIs for the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles will be reported. The Cox proportional hazards mo del will be fitted to compute the treatment HRs and the corresponding 95% CIs. Sensitivity analy ses to adjust for the influence of subsequent therapy on the OS may be conducted , and further details will be specified in the statistical anal ysis plan. 9.3.2.2. Objec tive Response Objective Response (OR) is defined as a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) per RECI ST version 1.1 (see Appendix 3) recorded from random ization until disease progression or start of new anti- cancer therap y. Both CR and PR must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for response are first met. A patient will be considered to have achieved an O R if the patient has a sustained CR or PR according to RECI ST version 1.1 definitions. Otherwise, the patient will be considered as a non-responder in the ORR analy sis. Additionally , patients with inadequate data for tumor assessment (eg, no baseline assessment or no follow -up assessments) will be considered as non-responders in the ORR analy sis."

In addition, the Best Overall Response (BOR) for each patient will be summarized by treatment arm. 9.3.2.3. Intracranial Objective Response Intracranial Objective Response (IC- OR) is defined as above for OR but it is only based on intracranial disease in the subset of patients with at least 1 intracranial lesion. The I C-OR will be summarized similar to how OR will be summarized as described above. Ifdata permits, I C-OR will also be summarized in the subset of patients with at least 1measurable intracranial lesion. 9.3.2.4. Intracranial Time to Progression Intracranial Time to Progression (TTP) is defined as the time from randomization to the date of the first documentation of objective progression of intracranial disease, based on either new brain metastases or progression of existing brain m etastase s. IC-TTP will be calculated for the FA set and for subgroups of patients with and without brain metastases at baseline. For the subgroup of patients without brain metastases at baseline onl y the new brain metastases will be considered events. Differences between treatment arms willbe assessed by the stratified log -rank test. IC-TTP associated with each treatment arm will be summarized using the Kaplan -Meier method and display ed graphically where appropriate. CIs for the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles will be reported. The Cox proportional hazards model will be fitted to compute the treatment HRs and the corresponding 95% CI s. Intracranial progression events may also be anal yzed by cumulative incidence functions. 9.3.2.5. Duration of Response Duration of Response (DR) is defined, for patients with an OR per RECI ST version 1.1, as the time from the first documentation of objective tumor response (CR or PR) to the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to an y cause, whichever occurs first. Censoring rules for DR will follow those described above for PFS. DR will be summarized by treatment arm using Kaplan -Meier methods and display ed graphicall y, where appropriate.

The trial allows for the stop ping of the study for a superior OS result, provided the primary PFS endpoint has alread y been shown to be statistically significant favoring lorlatinib. 9.7.Data Monitoring Committee This study will use an external data monitoring committee (E- DMC ) comprised of at least 3 members with at least one having appropriate medical qualifications and one statistician. The E-DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safet y of patients in the study and the evaluation of efficacy at the IA saccording to the charter . The recommendations made b y the E -DMC to alter the conduct of the study will be forwarded to Pfizer Oncology Management for final decision. Pfizer will forward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate anal yses of endpoint events and of safet y data that are not endpoints, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate. The expected frequency of the E -DMC meetings and what will be presented or decided at the meetings will be detailed in the DMC charter. 10.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE Pfizer or its agent will conduct periodic monitoring visits during stud y conduct to ensure that the protocol and Good Clinical Practices (GCPs) are being followed. The monitors may review source documents to confirm that the data recorded on CRF s are accurate. The investigator and institution will allow Pfizer monitors/auditors or its agents and appropriate regulatory authorities direct access to source documents to perform this verification. This verification may also occur after study complet ion. During stud y conduct and/or after stud y completion, the investigator site may be subject to review b y the IRB/EC, and/or to quality assurance audits performed by Pfizer, or companies working with or on behalf of Pfizer, and/or to inspection by appropr iate regulatory authorities."

Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with Pfizer or its agents to prepare the investiga tor site for the inspection and will allow Pfizer or its agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the inspection. The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve an y discrepancies that are identified between the stud y data and the subje ct's medical records. The investigator will promptl y provide copies of the inspection findings to Pfizer or its agent. Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide Pfizer or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings. It is important that the investigators and their relevant personnel are available during the monitoring visits and possible audits or inspections and that sufficient time is devoted to the process. 11.DATA HA NDLING AND RECORD KE EPING 11.1. Case Report Forms/Electronic Data Record As used in this protocol, the term CRF should be understood to refer to either a paper form or an electronic data record or both, depending on the data collection method used in this study . A CRF is required and should be completed for each included patient. The completed original CRFs are the sole propert y of Pfizer and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of Pfizer or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from Pfizer. The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safet y, and laboratory data entered on the CRFs and any other data collection forms (source docu ments) and ensuring that they are accurate, authentic/original, attributable, complete, consistent, legible, timely (contemporaneous), enduring, and available when required. The CRFs must be signed b y the investigator or b y an authorized staff member to a ttest that the data contained on the CRFs are true. An y corrections to entries made in the CRFs or source documents must be dated, initialed, and explained (if necessary) and should not obscure the original entry . In most cases, the source documents are the hospital or the phy sician patient chart. In these cases, data collected on the CRFs must match the data in those charts. In some cases, the CRF may also serve as the source document. In these cases, a document should be available at the investigator site and at Pfizer that clearl y identifies those data that will be recorded on the CRF, and for which the CRF will stand as the source document. 11.2. Record Retention To enable evaluations and/or inspections/audits from regulatory authorities or Pfizer, the investigator agrees to keep records, including the identity of all participating patients (sufficient information to link records, eg, CRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent documents, copies of all CRFs, safet y reporting forms, sou rce documents, and detailed records of treatment disposition, and adequate documentation of relevant"
111,page_111,"Lorlatinib (PF 06463922) B7461006 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 4 October 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 112correspondence (eg, letters, meeting minutes, and telephone call reports). The records should be retained b y the investigator according to the ICH guideli nes, according to local regulations, or as specified in the clinical study agreement (CSA), whichever is longer. If the investigator becomes unable for an y reason to continue to retain study records for the required period (eg, retirement, relocation), Pfi zer should be prospectivel y notified. The study records must be transferred to a designee acceptable to Pfizer, such as another investigator, another institution, or an independent third party arranged by Pfizer. Investigator records must be kept for a m inimum of 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study or for longer if required by applicable local regulations. The investigator must obtain Pfizer's written permission before disposing of an y records, even if retention requirements have b een met. 12.ETHICS 12.1. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee It is the responsibility of the investigator to have prospective approval of the study protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent documents, and other relevant documents, eg, recruitment adve rtisements, if applicable, from the I RB/EC. All correspondence with the IRB/EC should be retained in the investigator file. Copies of I RB/EC approvals should be forwarded to Pfizer. The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IR B/EC approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the patients. In that event, the investigator must notify the IRB/EC and Pfizer in writing immediately after the implementation. 12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, legal and regulatory requirements and the general principles set forth in the I nternational Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects (Council for International Organization s of Medical Sciences 2002), ICH Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and the Declaration of Helsinki. In addition, the study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, and any applicable local regulatory requirements and laws. 12.3. Patient Information and Consent All parties will ensure protection of patient personal data and will not include patient names or other identifiable data in any reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where required b y law."
112,page_112,"Lorlatinib (PF 06463922) B7461006 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 4 October 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 113When study data are compiled for trans fer to Pfizer and other authorized parties, patient names, addresses, and other identifiable data will be replaced b y numerical codes based on a numbering s ystem provided by Pfizer in order to de -identify study patients. The investigator site will maintai n a confidential list of patients who participated in the study, linking each patient’s numerical code to his or her actual identity. In case of data transfer, Pfizer will maintain high standards of confidentialit y and protection of patients’ personal dat a consistent with applicable privacy laws. The informed consent documents and an y patient recruitment materials must be in compliance with ICH Good Clinical Practice (GCP), local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements, including applicable privacy laws. The informed consent documents used during the informed consent process and any patient recruitment materials must be reviewed and approved by Pfizer, approved by the IRB/EC before use, and available for inspection. The investigator must ensure that each study patient, or his or her legall y acceptable representative, is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the study and possible risks associated with participation. Whenever consent is obtained from a patient’s legally acceptable represe ntative, the patient’s assent (affirmative agreement) must subsequently be obtained when the patient has the capacity to provide assent, as determined by the IRB/EC. If the investigator determines that a patient’s decisional capacity is so limited he/she cannot reasonabl y be consulted, then, as permitted by the IRB/EC and consistent with local regulatory and legal requirements, the patient’s assent may be waived with source documentation of the reason assent was not obtained. If the stud y patient does not provide his or her own consent, the source documents must record wh y the patient did not provide consent (eg, minor, decisionally impaired adult), how the investigator determined that the person signing the consent was the patient’s legall y acceptable rep resentative, the consent signer’s relationship to the study patient (eg, parent, spouse), and that the patient’s assent was obtained or waived. If assent is obtained verball y, it must be documented in the source documents. The investigator, or a person de signated b y the investigator, will obtain written informed consent from each patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative, before an y study -specific activity is performed. The investigator will retain the original of each patient's signed co nsent document. 12.4. Reporting of Safety Issues and Serious Breaches of the Protocol or ICH GCP In the event of an y prohibition or restriction imposed (ie, clinical hold) b y an applicable regulatory authorit y in any area of the world, or if the investigator is aware of any new information that might influence the evaluation of the benefits and risks of the investigational product, Pfizer should be informed immediately."
113,page_113,"Lorlatinib (PF 06463922) B7461006 Final Protocol Amendment 4, 4 October 2019 PFIZER CONFIDENTIAL Page 114In addition, the investigator will inform Pfizer immediately of any urgent safet y measures taken b y the investigator to protect the study subjects against an y immediate hazard, and of any serious breaches of this protocol or of ICH GCP that the investigator becomes aware of. 13.DEFINITION OF END OF TRIAL A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the study including the last visit. The end of the stud y is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the study. 14.SPONSOR DISCONTINUAT ION CRITERIA Premature termination of this study may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, change in opinion of the IRB/EC, or investigational product safety problems, or at the discretion of Pfizer. In addition, Pfizer retains the right to discontinue development of lorlatinib at any time. If a stud y is prematurel y terminated, Pfizer will promptly notify the investigator. After notification, the investigator must contact all participating patients and the hospital pharmacy (if applicable) within 1 month. As directed b y Pfizer, all study mater ials must be collected and all CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible. 15.PUBLICATION OF STUDY RESULTS 15.1. Communication of Results by Pfizer Pfizer fulfills its commitment to publicly disclose clinical trial results through posting the results of studies on www.clinicaltrials.gov (ClinicalTrials.gov), the European Clinical Trials Database (EudraCT), and/or www.pfizer.com, and other public registries in accordance with applicable local laws/regulations.

Publications by Investigators Pfizer supports the exercise of academic freedom and has no objection to publication by the principal investigator (PI) of the results of the study based on information collected or generated b y the PI , whether or not the results are favorable to the Pfizer product. However, to ensure against inadvertent disclosure of confidential information or unprotected inventions, the investigator will provide Pfizer an opportunity to review any proposed publicatio n or other t ype of disclosure of the results of the study (collectively, “ publication”) before it is submitted or otherwise disclosed. The investigator will provide any publication to Pfizer at least 30 days before it is submitted for publication or otherw ise disclosed. If an y patent action is required to protect intellectual propert y rights, the investigator agrees to delay the disclosure for a period not to exceed an additional 60 days. The investigator will, on request, remove an y previously undisclosed confidential information before disclosure, except for an y study-or Pfizer product -related information necessary to the appropriate scientific presentation or understanding of the study results. If the stud y is part of a multicenter study, the investigato r agrees that the first publication is to be a joint publication covering all investigator sites, and that an y subsequent publications by the PI will reference that primary publication. However, if a joint manuscript has not been submitted for publication within 12 months of completion or termination of the study at all participating sites, the investigator is free to publish separatel y, subject to the other requirements of this section. For all publications relating to the study, the institution will comp ly with recognized ethical standards concerning publications and authorship, including Section II -“Ethical Considerations in the Conduct and Reporting of Research” of the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals, http://www.icmje.org/index.html#authorship, established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors."

Measurability of Tumor Lesions At baseline, individual tumor lesions will be categoriz ed by the Investigator as either measurable or non -measurable b y the RECI ST criteria as described below. Measurable: Tumor lesion : Must be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size of: 10mm by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness no greater than 5mm); 5mm for CNS lesions provi ded gadolinium contrast enhanced MRI is perfo rmed with contingent slices of 1 mm; 10mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be accuratel y measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable). Malignant l ymph nodes : To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a l ymph node must be 15mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed. Non-Measurable: All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <10mm or pathological ly mph nodes with  10mm to <15 mmshort a xis) as well as truly non-measurable lesions. Lesions considered trul y non-measurable include: leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, ly mphangitic involvement of skin, or lung, abdominal masses/abdom inal organomegal y identified by physical exam that is not measurable b y reproducible imaging techniques. NOTE: If measurable disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed b y cytology /histology . Recording Tumor Measu rements All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2lesions per organ and 5lesions in total representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and measured and recorded at baseline and at the stipulated intervals during treatment . Exception to this rule is in the presence of CNS metastases ≥5 mm in diameter assessed by gadoli nium contrasted MRI with slices of 1 mm; up to 5 CNS lesions will be permitted in addition to 5extracranial lesions previously noted .33Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesion with the longest diameters) and their suitability for accurate repetitive measurements (either b y imaging techniques or clinically )."

The sum of the longest diameter for all target lesions will be calculated and recorded as the baseline sum longest diameter to be used as reference to further characterize the objective tumor response of the measurable dimension of the disease during treatment. All measurements should be performed using a caliper or ruler and should be recorded in metric notation in centimeters. All oth er lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and these lesions should be followed as “present” or “absent.” Techniques for Assessing Measurable Disease The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at screening and during follow- up. I maging -based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical (phy sical) examination when both meth ods have been used to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment. Definitions of Tumor Response Target Lesions Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological ly mph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have reduction in short axis to <10mm. Partial response (PR) is defined as a  30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions. Progressive disease (PD) is defined as a  20% increase in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dimensions recorded since the treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new lesions. In addition to the relative increase o f 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. Stable disease (SD) is defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as a reference the smallest sum of the longest dim ensions since the treatment started. Non-Target Lesions Complete response (CR) is defined as the disappearance of all non -target lesions. Alllymph nodes must be non -pathological in size (<10 mm short axis) . Non-CR/Non -PDis defined as a persistence of 1 non -target lesions. Progressive disease (PD) is defined as unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, or the appearance of 1new lesion."

Confirmation of Tumor Response To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements in patients with responding tumors must be confirmed b y repeat studies that should be performed 4weeks after the criteria for response are first met. In the case of SD, follow -up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once afte r study entry at a minimum interval of 6weeks.

For CR and PR, t he patient’s best respons e assignment willdepend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria. In the case of SD, follow -up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after stud y entry at a minimum interval of 6 weeks. NOTE: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be reported as “symptomatic deterioration”. Every effort should be made to document the obj ective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. It should also be noted that a tumor marker increase does not constitute adequate objective evidence of tumor progression. However, such a tumor marker increase should prompt a repeat radiograph ic evaluation to document whether or not objective tumor progression has occurred. In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. When the evaluation of complete response depends upon this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be investigated by fine needle aspirate or biopsy before confirming the complete response status."
