Sponsor Name, Location IPSEN 106 Allen Road , Basking Ridge, NJ 07920 Ipsen Contact: Rationale Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) comprise a heterogeneous group of neoplasms originating from neural crest cells, endocrine glands, endocrine islets or the diffuse e ndocrine system. The majority of NETs are sporadic and little is known about their risk factors. In some cases NETs form part of heritable tumour syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 or tuberous sclerosis. Although considered rare malignancies, recent data suggest an increase in NETs incidence over the past 30 years, with 5.2 cases per 100,000 population per year. NETs of pancreatic, intestinal and bronchopulmonary origin are the most common, with the incidence of bronchopulmonary or bronchial NETs at 1.35 per 100,000; this is seemingly a drastic increase from the annual incidence of 0.3 per 100,000 of 1973 [Yao 2008]. Bronchial NETs account for approximately 1 to 2 percent of all lung malignancies in adults and roughly 20 to 30 percent of all NETs. NETs of thorax include lung and thymus NETs. There are 4 types of lung neuroendocrine cancers - typical carcinoid, atypical carcinoid, large -cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (NECs), and small -cell lung cancer (SCLC). Like neuroendocrine tumours at other body sites, bronchial NETs are thought to derive from peptide- and amine -producing neuroendocrine cells that have migrated from the embryologic neural crest. While surgery remains the treatment of choice for patients with resectable tumours, there are limited options for those with advanced or metastatic disease with unresectable tumours. The primary goal in the treatment of unresectable, advan ced NETs is to prevent tumour progression and reduce the symptoms related to carcinoid syndrome when present. Typical and atypical carcinoid metastatic lung NETs are associated with poor prognosis; with median survival averaging 17 months and the 5 -year survival rate approximately at 27%. However, recent studies dedicated to stage IV lung NETs suggest better median PPD"

There is a clear unmet need in patients with advanced lung NETs. Limited data are available regarding treatment for advanced lung NETs due to the rarity of the disease. In most cases, treatment guidelines are extrapolated from the clinical experience with the more common gastrointestinal (GI) NETs or mixe d retrospective studies. Recently recommendations issued from the European Neuroendocrine Tumour Society for best practice for typical and atypical pulmonary carcinoid have been published. To date, availa ble data on the application of Somatostatin analogs (SSAs) or other systemic intervention in lung NETs come from two prospective studies conducted in lung NETs progressive patients: - In RADIANT 2 study, the median PFS (measured by local and central review in the lung NET subgroup), was 2.8 and 5.6 months, respectively, in the oc treotide group (n=11) versus 8.8 and 13.6 months, respectively, in th e everolimus plus octreotide group (n=33). - In RADIANT 4 study, conducted in patients with well- differentiated (G1/G2), advanced, progressive, non- functional NET of lung or GI origin, a reduction of 52% in the relative risk of progression or death with everolimus versus placebo (Hazard ratio = 0.48 (95% CI, 0.35- 0.67); p<0.00001) was demonstrated in the overall population. There are also some data reported from retrospective single centre study involving 61 patients with lung NET treated with SSAs, the estimated median PFS was 17.4 months (12.8 months in the AC subgroup and 24.8 months in the TC subgroup). In another study where nine patients were treated with oc treotide and 13 patients were treated with lanreotide, a median PFS of 18.1 months was reported for 22 patients (32% of whom had AC). In a further study, a median PFS of 16.5 months was reported in 22 patients treated with SSA s. Recently, the CLARINET study demonstrated that first -line treatment with Lanreotide Autogel/Depot 120 mg, a somatostatin analogue (SSA), significantly prolonged progression free survival among subjects with metastatic grade 1 or 2 enteropancreatic NETs of (Ki 67 <10%) [Caplin 2014]. This is the first and only registration study of an SSA (Lanreotide Autogel/Depot 120 mg) demonstrating a cancer treatment benefit in this gast rointestinal and pancreatic NET population. While, subjects with bronchi al neuroendocrine tumours (B- NETs) were not included in CLARINET, there is a well -established basis for the use of SSAs like Lanreotide Autogel/Depot 120 mg in the management of lung NETs the high expression of the somatostatin receptors SSTR2A and SSTR3 Besides their role in imaging for NETs (somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) or octreotide sc an), SSAs are also therapeutically used mainly to control hormone re lated symptoms, which occur in up"

Recent updates of NCCN & ENET S guidelines recommend SSA in first line for the treatment of locoregional unresectable or metastatic lung NETs as an option beyond ‘observation’. Consequently, it w as decided to prematurely stop the recruitment in the SPINET study and to transition subjects still treated in the double- blind phase to the OL treatment phase . The transition to the OL treatment period, will be done per subject , at the planned scheduled visit (ie, approximately 28 days fro m the last injection) following the country approval of Amendment #5 .

The majority of NETs are sporadic and little is known about their risk factors. In some case s NETs form part of heritable tumour syndromes such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 or tuberous sclerosis [1]. Although considered rare malignancies, recent data suggest an increase in NETs incidence over the past 30 years, with 5.2 cases per 100,000 population per year [2]. NETs of pancreatic intestinal and bronchopulmonary origin are the most common, with the incidence of bronchopulmonary or bronchial NETs at 1.35 per 100,000 [2]; this is seemingly a drastic increase from the annual incidence of 0.3 per 100,000 of 1973 [2]. Bronchopulmonary NETs account for approximate ly 1 to 2 percent of all lung malignancies in adults and roughly 20 to 30 percent of all NETs [2, 3, 4, 5]. NETs of thorax in clude lung NETs and thymus NETs [5, 6]. Pulmonary NETs are classified in four categories, typical carcinoid, atypical carcinoid, large - cell NETs, and small -cell lung cancer (SCLC) [7]. Like neuroendocrine tumour s at other body sites, bronchial NETs are thought to derive from peptide - and amine -producing neuroendocrine cells that have migrated from the em bryologic neural crest. While surgery remains the treatment of c hoice for patients with resectable tumour s, there are limited options for those with advanc ed or metastatic disease with unresectable tumour s [8, 5]. The primary goal in the treatment of unresectable , advanced NETs is to prevent tumour progression and reduce the symptoms related to carcinoid syndrome when present. Current treatment guide lines, including the 2015 N ational Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for advanced lung NETs include observation or active surveillance as an option [9]. Typical and atypical carcinoid metastatic lung NETs are associated with poor prognosis; with median survival averaging 17 months and the 5 -year survival rate approximately at 27% [2, 5]. However, recent studies dedicated to stage IV lung NETs suggest better median OS of 5 to 10 years for atypical and typical carcinoids [10, 11, 12]. There is a clear unmet need in patients with advanced lung NETs. 1.2 Compound Review INN: Lanreotide Autogel/Depot Chemical formula: S ----------------------------- S D-β-Nal-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Thr-NH2 Empirical formula: C54H69N11O10S2 Molecular weight: 1096.34 Lanreotide is an octapeptide analogue of somatostatin. The depot formulation is a nov el, prolonged release preparation of L anreotide acetate and water for injection, which together CCI"
34,page_34,"IPSEN GROUP A-US-52030-328 CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL FINAL (INCLUDING AMENDMENT #5): 28 JANUARY 2019 PAGE 35 form a supersaturated solution of the peptide. Prolonged release of the peptide occurs by the physical nature of the supersaturated solution. The formulation enabl es active serum levels to be maintained for 1 to 2 months. The approved dosing regimen for gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumour s is one deep subcutaneous ( SC) injection of Lanreotide Autogel/Depot 120 mg (LAN) , every 28 days in adults. The most c ommonly reported side effects for Lanreo tide Autogel/Depot are: diarrhea (or loose stools), abdominal pain, and cholelit hiasis. Other common side effects a re: pancreatic enzyme decrease, weight decrease , nervous system disorders, headache, lethargy, dizz iness, nausea, vomiting, gas, bloating, constipation, fa tty stool, heartburn, hair loss, low blood sugar, decreased appetite, diabetes mellitus, high bloo d sugar, injection site reactions (e.g. pain, mass, hardness, nodule, itching), fatigue, weakness, mus culoskeletal pain, and muscle pain. A more detailed description of the product is given in Section 3.4. 1.3 Clinical Trial Rationale Limited data are available regarding treatment for advanced lung NETs due to the rarity of the disease. Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents have re sulted in only minor activity in this disease and there is no standard therapeutic regimen. Participation in c linical trials testing new strategies is the preferred approach [13]. In most cases, treatment guidelines are extrapolated from the clinical experi ence with the more common gastrointestinal (GI) NETs or mixed retrospective studies . To date, available data on the application of Somatostatin analogs (SSAs) or other systemic intervention in lung NETs come from two prospective studies conducted in lung N ETs progressive patients: • In RADIANT 2 study, the median PFS (measu red by local and central review in the lung NET subgroup), was 2.8 and 5.6 months, respectively, in the octreotide group (n=11) versus 8.8 and 13.6 months, respectively, in the everolimus plus octreotide group (n=33) [ 14]. • In RADIANT 4 study, conducted in patients with well -differentiated (G1/G2), advanced, progressive, non -functional NET of lung or GI origin, a reduction of 52% in the relative risk of progression or death with everolimus versus placebo (Hazard ratio = 0.48 (95% CI, 0.35 -0.67); p<0.00001) was demonstrated in the overall population [ 15]. There are also some data reported from retrospective single centre study involving 61 patients with lung NET treated with SSAs, the es timated median PFS was 17.4 months (12.8 mont hs in the AC subgroup and 24.8 months in the TC subgroup) [ 16]. In another study where nine patients were treated with octreotide and 13 patients w ere treated with lanreotide, a median PFS of 18.1 months was reported for 22 patients (32% of whom had AC) [ 17]. In a further study, a median PFS of 16.5 months was reported in 22 patients treated with SSAs [ 18]. Recently, the CLARINET study demonstrated that treatment with Lanreotide Autogel/D epot 120 mg , a somatostatin analogue (SSA), significantly prolonged PFS among subjects with metastatic enteropancreatic NETs of grade 1 or 2 (Ki -67 <10%) [19]. This is the first and only registration study of an SSA ( Lanreotide Autogel/Depot 120 mg ) demonstrating a tumour control benefit in this patient population. While, patients with bronchial neuroendocrine tumour s (BPNETs) were not included in CLARINET, there is a well -established basis for the use of SSAs like Lanreotide Autogel/Depot 120 mg in the management of lung NETs the high expression of the somatostatin receptors SSTR2A and SSTR3 [20]."
35,page_35,"IPSEN GROUP A-US-52030-328 CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL FINAL (INCLUDING AMENDMENT #5): 28 JANUARY 2019 PAGE 36 Besides their role in imaging for NETs (somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SRS) such as octreotide scan), SSAs are also therapeu tically used mainly to control hormone related symptoms, which occur in up to 40% of cases of hypersecretion in patients with advanced lung NET tumours [ 12]. Recent updates of NCCN & ENETs guidelines recommend SSA in first line for the treatment of locoregional unresectable or metastatic lung NETs as an option beyond ‘observation’ [21, 22]. Consequently, it was decided to prematurely stop the recruitment in the SPINET study and to transition subjects still treated in the double -blind phase to the OL treatment phase. The new aim of this Phase 3, multicenter, prospective, randomized placebo controlled clinical study is to describe the anti tumour efficacy and safety of Lanreotide Autogel/Depot 120 mg (LAN) plus Best Supportive Care (BSC) in subj ects with well differentiated, metastatic and/or unresectable, typical or atypical, lung NETs . Placebo plus BSC /best supportive care was chosen as the cont rol arm because there are no definitive, well -controlled studies demonstrating the efficacy and safety of SSAs in this setting. Current 2015 NCCN recommendations for Lung NET include observation for asymptomatic low -bulk typical pulmonary carcinoids. 2015 European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society ( ENETS ) guidance includes observation for asymptomatic pulmonary carcinoids of low proliferative index [9]. Further details can be found in the Investigator Brochure (IB). 1.4 Compliance Statement The study will be conducted in compl iance with institutional review boards /independent ethics committees (IRBs /IECs ), informed consent regulations, the Declaration of Helsinki and International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines. Any episode of noncompliance will be documented. This study will utilize Electronic Data Capture (EDC) which will be conducted in compliance with the fol lowing regulations: Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 21 C ode of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11, Electronic Records, Electronic Signatures, and FDA, Guidance for Industry: Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Trials. In addition, th is study will adh ere to all USA FDA and other local regulatory requirements and relevant company policies . Before initiating this study, the investigator/institution should have written and dated approval/favorable opinion from the IRB /IEC and local Regulatory Authority (ies) where required for the study protocol/amendment(s), wr itten informed consent form, any consent form updates, subject emergency study contact cards, subje ct recruitment procedures (e.g. advertisements), any written informa tion to be provided to subject s and a statement from the IRB /IEC that they comply with GCP requirements.

These subjects must not require SSAs treatment for symptom control. It was planned to enrol 216 subject s at approximately 30 centers across the United States , 6 in Canada and 40 in Europe ( including, but not limited to Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain , Sweden and the United Kingdom) . At time of Protocol Amendment #5, a total of 38 centers have actively recruited at least one subject in 10 countries . Due to the premature stop of the recruitment, 77 subjects are enrolled. 2 PURPOSE OF THE STUDY AND STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1 Purpose of the Study The purpose of this study is to describe the role of LAN plus BSC in the management of metastatic and/or unresectable, well differen tiated, ty pical or atypical lung NETs. There have been very limited data in this subject setting, except for sub -analyses of larger randomized studies; but there is a clear molecular rational e that establishes the potential role of SSAs like LAN plus BSC in advance d lung NETs [20]. 2.2 Study Objectives 2.2.1 Primary Objective • To describe the antitumour efficacy of LAN monotherapy plus BSC every 28 days, in terms of progression -free survival (PFS) , measured by central review using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1 criteria , every 12 weeks, in subjects with unresectable and/ or metastatic well differentiated, typical or atypical lung neuroendoc rine tumours in either the double blind phase, or in the OL period . 2.2.2 Secondary Efficacy Objectives • To describe the antitumour efficacy during the double -blind phase of LAN monotherapy plus BSC every 28 days and placebo plus BSC, in terms of progression free survival (PFS), measured by central review using RECIST v1.1 criteria, every 12 weeks, in subjects with unresectable and/or metastatic well differentiated, typical or atypical lung NETs . • To describe the antit umour efficacy during the double -blind phase of LAN monotherapy plus BSC every 28 days and placebo plus BSC, in terms of progression free survival (PFS), measured by local review using RECIST v1.1 criteria, every 12 weeks, in subjects with unresectable and /or metastatic well differentiated, typical or atypical lung NETs . • To describe the objective response rate (ORR) of LAN monotherapy plus BSC every 28 days and placebo plus BSC, as assessed by RECIST v 1.1criteria (proportion of subjects with a n objective response of partial response (PR) or complete response (CR)) in the double blind phase , • To describe time to treatment failure (Kaplan Meier estimates) of LAN monotherapy plus BSC every 28 days and placebo plus BSC in the double blind phase , • To describe the changes from Baseline in the biomarker chromogranin A (CgA) during the double -blind and the OL treatment phase s,"

As planned initially, a total of 216 eligible subjects with well -differentiated typical or atypical, metastatic and/or unresectable l ung NETs, and a positive somatostatin receptor imaging (SRI) (Octreoscan® ≥ grade 2 Krenning scale; Ga -PET scan: uptake greater than liver background ), had to be randomized 2:1 to either LAN plus BSC (120mg/28 days) or placebo plus BSC following the strati fication of 1) typical versus atypical and 2) prior chemotherapy versus no prior chemotherapy*. Due to the prema ture stop of the recruitm ent (as per Protocol Amendment #5), 77 subjects are enrolled. All subj ects still treated in the DB Phase will enter into the OL Treatment Period (either for follow up or for OL treatment) . The transition to the OL treatment period, will be done by country and per subject , at the next planned scheduled visit (i .e. approximately 28 days from the last injection). Subjects enrolled into the study will stay on LAN therapy (i .e. OL Treatment Period) until evidence of disease progression (assessed locally and confirmed centrally) , development of unacceptable toxicity, or premature withdrawal for any reason or up to 18 months after the last subject randomised . After disease progression subjects will be fo llowed for survival, QoL and all subsequent anticancer treatments up to the end of the study. * cytotoxic chemotherapy or molecular targeted therapy or interferon . This study contains two phases : the Double -Blind (DB) Phase, and the Open Labe l (OL) Extension Phase. The DB Phase include d: Screening , Baseline and Treatment period . The OL Extension Phase consist s of two periods: Treatment Period and Follow -Up Period. The DB Phase include d a Screening Visit to establish protocol eligibility and disease characteristics . The Baseline Visit confirm ed eligibility prior to randomization and treatment. The DB Phase of the study will end with Protocol Amendement #5 and will be followed by the OL Treatment Period. At the end of the OL Extension Treatment period, if subjects are still benefiting from treatment (i.e. not progressing) and there is sufficient evid ence of safety and efficacy of it, the subjects will have the option, to continue to receive lanreotide 120 mg every 28 days up to disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . In such a situation, as permitted by local regulations, lanreotide 120 mg will be provided free of char ge by the sponsor to the sites under its commercial packaging. During this period , the physician will report immediately to Ipsen Pharmacovigilance Contact any safety concerns arising from the use of the product."

The investig ator and/or sponsor can withdraw a subject from the study at any time for any reason (e.g . protocol violation or deviation as defined in Section 12.1.2, noncompliance with the protocol conditions or AE). In addition, a subject may be withdrawn from the study as described in Section s 4.3 and 8.1.7 During the conduct of th e study, study drug can be temporarily discontinued (see Section 8.1.7 ). Any change in the administration of study drug or its discontinuation will be documented in the eCRF. During the conduct of the study, SAEs will be reviewed (see Section 8.1.4 ) as they are reported from the study centre t o identify safety concerns. The study may be terminated by the sponsor at any time. 3.7 Early Study Termination The sponsor may terminate this study at any time. Reasons for termination may include but are not limited to, the following: • The incidence or severity of adverse events (AEs) in this or other studies point to a potential health hazard for trial subject s, • Insufficient subject enrolment, • Any information becoming available during the study that substantially changes the expected be nefit risk profile of the study treatments. Due to the recruitment stop, all enrolled subjects will be followed up to disease progression or up to 18 months after the last subject randomi sed. At the end of the OL Extension Treatment period, if subjects are still benefiting from treatment (i.e. not progressing) and there is sufficient evidence of the safety and efficacy of it, the subjects will have the option, to conti nue to receive lanreotide 120 mg every 28 days up to disease progression or unacceptable t oxicity .

During this pe riod, the physician will report immediately to Ipsen Pharmacovigila nce Contact any safety concerns arising from the use of the product. 3.8 Study Drug Preparation Storage and Accountability 3.8.1 Study Drug Storage and Security In order to maintain the blinded conditions of the study t he investigator must assign an independent non-blinded representative (e.g. pharmacist), who will ensure that all study drug and any other study related material is store d in a secured area, under recommended temperature monitored storage conditions (between +2°C and +8°C) , in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. 3.8.2 Study Drug Preparation and Accountability The non -blinded qualified person will ensure that all study drug s are dispensed by qualified staff members. All study drug and any other study related material is to be accounted for on the study drug accountability log provided by the sponsor or designated CRO . It is essential that all used and unused supplies are retained for verification (by the sponsor o r sponsor’s representative ). The investigator should ensure adequate recor ds are maintained in the study drug accountability log. Drug accountability will be performed by an unblinded monitor from the Sponsor of its representative . The unblinded monitor will ensure that study drug administration, study drug dispensing/accountability logs and the number of used/non used treatments are consistent. Study drug will be destroyed preferably on site or returned to CMC -SC ( ). The destruction of used a nd unused study drug s should be carried out only after any discrepancies have been investigated and satisfactorily explained and the reconciliation has been accepted. 3.9 Maintenance of Randomi zation and blinding All of the boxes of study treatments will be id entical in appearance but the content of boxes will be different to each other . In addition, since LAN and placebo are not similar in appearance, an independent qualified pe rson appointed by the investigator w ill be required to prepare and inject the study drug , allowing the blinded conditions of the study to be maintained. These unblinded individuals will be fully trained in the method of blinding for the subject, the investigator and the remainder of the proj ect team and must not be involved in any of clinical or safety assessments . In an emergency situation, which requires the identification of the study treatment group, the Investigator may break the treatment code immediately, or as quickly as possible if he/she finds it is in the best interest of the trial s ubject. The investigators have direct and immediate access to break the treatment code through the IWRS. At the earliest opportunity the CCI"

In addition, a set of hard copy sealed code break envelopes will be held by Global Patient Safety at Ipsen, in case of IWRS failure (t his set will be prepared by Ipsen Randomi zation manag er). If the code -break was performed using the IWRS, the investigator must store the email notification revealing the unblinded treatment in a sealed enve lope. The investigator will then sign, date and provide the reason for the code break on the emergency code break form, and on the sealed envelope. The date and reason for identifying the treatment group will be recorded in the eCRF. The study treatment will be administered in double -blind fashion. Neither subjects nor staff site personnel in charge of the clinical and safety evaluations will know who is receiving placebo plus BSC or LAN plus BSC . If progression is confirmed by the central assessment, and the subject agrees to enter the OL Extension then the investigator will ask the IWRS whether the subject is eligible to enter the OL Treatment Extension Period . • Subject assigned to placebo plus BSC : will be allowed to enter the OL Extension Treatment Period to receive OL LAN plus BSC • Subject assigned to LAN plus BSC : will stop study treatment and attend the Post Treatment Visit and subsequently enter the Follow -Up Period of the Extension Phase At time of Protocol Amendment #5, all subjects who are still treated in the DB Phase and who have not yet progressed will be moved to the OL Treatment Period without any unblinding . 3.10 Source Data Recorded on the Case Report Form Data will be collected in the eCRF in compliance with FDA 21 CFR Part 11. As required by GCP, the sponsor assigned monitor will verify, by direct referen ce to the source documents, that the data required by the protocol are accurat ely reported on the eCRF. The source documents must, as a minimum, con tain a statement that the subject is included in a clinical study, the date that informed consen t was obtained prior to participation in the study, the identity of the study, diagnosis and eligibility criteria, v isit dates (with subject status), study drug administration, and any AEs and associated concomitant medication. As required by ICH GCP Section 6.4.9, if some it ems are recorded directly on the eCRF and are considered as source data, the identification of these data must be doc umented and agreed between the investigator and the s ponsor.

Following confirmation of eligibility for the study, subjects were allocated to one of the following treatment groups: • LAN , deep subcutaneous, every 28 days plus BSC or • Placebo , deep su bcutaneous, every 28 days plus BSC Subjects will receive injections of the study drug to which they are allocated by deep subcutaneous injection (in the superior exter nal quadrant of the buttock) every 28 days thereafter . The first injection was administe red duri ng the baseline visit after randomization. Subjects will receive study drug according to this schedule until locally documented and centrally confirmed disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal for any reason or up to 1 8 months after the last subject randomised . Because LAN and the placebo were not similar in colour and a ppearance, an independent qualified and unblinded person appointed by the investigator prepare d and administer ed the injections, in order to maintain t he blinded conditions of the study. All study drugs were administered at the study centres by these qualified persons. 'Injection only' visits w ere not considered as study visits; however, the date and time of injection were recorded in the eCRF. There will be no dose modification as LAN administered at 120mg is well -tolerated, eff ective and has a safe AE profile. Based on our experience in subject s with Acromegaly, and in subject s with NETs in the CLARINET study, we do not anticipate toxicities that wo uld require either discontinuation or dose modification (for more details, see Sections 6.2 and 8.1.7 ). It is forbidden to use study drug for purposes other than as defined in this protocol. 6.1.1 Lanreotide Autogel/Depot Lanreotide Autogel/Depot 120 mg will be administered by deep s.c. injection in the superior, external quadrant of the buttock at a dose of 120 mg, every 28 days. Lanreotide Autogel/Depot 120 mg is a prolonged release, pharmaceutical form of lanreotide. It is a mixture of lanreotide acetate (0.246 mg/mg of product) and water (0.754 mg/mg of product) and is provided in a 0.5 mL prefilled syringe fitted with a 2 cm needle of 1.2 mm external diameter and an automatic safety system, sealed in a laminated bag.

Time to treatment failure will be d efined as the time from randomiz ation to treatment failure. 7.4.6 Quality of Life Quality of life will be assessed using the EORTC QLQ -C30 v3.0 questionnaire . The questionnaire will be completed at Baseline (Visit 2), every 12 weeks (throughout the DB and both OL phases), at the Post treatment/Early Withdrawal Visit at the end of the DB and both OL Phases. If necessary, the investigator or delegated personnel will explain the questions, which will be provided in a paper format, to the s ubject. The subject will complete the questionnaire in the same conditions throughout the study (i.e. prior to study medication administration) and the investigator or delega ted personnel will check that all question s have been answered. 7.4.7 Subsequent Therapies Details of all new cancer therapies during the OL Extension Follow -up phase will be collected. 8 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 8.1 Adverse Events Adverse events will be monitored from the time that the subject gives informed consent and throughout the study and up to 30 days after the last study drug administration . They will be elicited by direct, non -leading questioning or by spontaneous reports. Further details for AE reporting can be found in Section 8.1.2 . 8.1.1 Definition of an Adverse Event An A E is the development of an undesirable med ical condition or the deterioration of a pre - existing medical condition following or during exposure to a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered causally related to the product. An undesirable medical co ndition can be symptoms (e.g. nausea, chest pain), signs (e.g. tachycardia, enlarged liver) or the abnormal results of an investigation (e.g. laboratory findings, electrocardiogram). In clinical studies an AE can include an undesirable medical condition oc curring at any time, including run in or washout periods, even if no study drug has been administered. This definition includes events occurring from the time of the subject giving informed consent up to 30 days after last study drug administration . Natural progr ession or deterioration of the malignancy under study will be recorded as part of the efficacy evaluation and should not be recorded as an AE/SAE. Death due to disease progression will be recorded as part of the efficacy evaluation and will not be regarded as an SAE."

These signs and symptoms should only be reported as AEs/SAEs (depending on the investigator’s judgement) if they are: • Judged by the investigator to be u nusually severe or accelerated symptoms or • If the investigator considers the deterioration of signs and symptoms to be caused directly by the study drug . If there is any uncertainty about an AE bein g due solely to the malignancy under study, it should be reported as an AE/SAE as appropriate. 8.1.2 Categorisation of Adverse Events 8.1.2.1 Intensity Classification Adverse events will be recorded and graded according to the current versio n of t he NCI-CTCAE v4.03, dated 14 June 2010 . In view of meta -analyses , and for conversion purposes, the following conversion mapping will apply if the NCI -CTCAE scale is not available for a given AE: • NCI-CTCAE Grade 1 corresponds to mild, • NCI-CTCAE Grade 2 corresponds to moderate, • NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 corresponds to severe, • NCI-CTCAE Grade 4 corresponds to life threatening/disabling, • NCI-CTCAE Grade 5 corresponds to death (related to AE). Where: • Mild : symptoms do not alter the subject’s normal functioning • Moderate : symptoms produce some degree of impairment to function, but are not hazardous, uncomfortable or embarrassing to the subject • Severe : sympto ms definitely hazardous to well -being, significant impairment of function or incapacitation. • Life threatenin g: any event that places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred, i.e. it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death (a lso see Section 8.1.4 ). 8.1.2.2 Causality Classification The relationship of an AE to study drug administration will be cla ssified according to the following:"
80,page_80,"IPSEN GROUP A-US-52030-328 CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL FINAL (INCLUDING AMENDMENT #5): 28 JANUARY 2019 PAGE 81 • Related : reports including good reasons and sufficient information (e.g . plausible time sequence, dose response relationship, pharmacology, positive dechallenge and/or rechallenge) to assume a causal relationship with study drug administration in the sense that it is plausible, conceivable or likely . • Not related : reports including good reasons and sufficient information (e.g. implausible time sequence and/or attributable to concurrent disease or other drugs) to rule out a causal relationship with study drug administration. 8.1.2.3 Assessment of Expectedness The reference document for assessing expectedness of AEs in this study will be the current IB. 8.1.2.4 Laboratory Test Abnormalities Abnormalities in laboratory test values should only be reported as AEs if any of the following apply: • They result in a change in study drug schedule of administration (change in dosage, delay in administration, study drug discontinuation), • They require intervention or a diagnosis evaluation to assess the risk to the subject, • They are considered as clinically significant by the inv estigator. 8.1.2.5 Abnormal Physical Examination Findings Clinically significant changes, in the judgement of the investigator, in physical examination findings (abnormalities) will be recorded as AEs. 8.1.2.6 Other Investigation Abnormal Findings Abnormal test findin gs as judged by the investigator as clinically significant (e.g. electrocardiogram changes , thyroid function disturbances ) that result in a change in study drug dosage or administration schedule, or in discontinuation of the study drug , or require interven tion or diagnostic evaluation to assess the risk to the subject, should be recorded as AEs. 8.1.3 Recording and Follow up of Adverse Events At each visit (during the DB and OL phase) , the subject should be asked a non -leading question such as: “H ow have you felt since the last visit?” 'Injection only' visits will not be considered as study visits; however, any AEs reported at these visits will be recorded on the eCRF, re ported to the sponsor (if an SAE), and followed up as appropriate by the resp onsible investigational site staff . All observed or volunteered AEs, regardle ss of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to study drug , will be recorded on the AE page(s) of the eCRF. Events involving drug reactions, accidents, illnesses with o nset during the treatment phase of the study, or"

Any AEs already recorded and designated as ‘continuing’ should be rev iewed at each subsequent assessment. For all AEs, the investigator must pursue a nd obtain information adequate both to determine the outcome of the AE and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a SAE requiring immediate notification to the sponsor or its designated repr esentative. For all AEs, sufficient information should be obtained by the investigator to determine the causality of the AE (i.e. study drug or other illness). The investigator is re quired to assess causality and record that assessment on the eCRF. Follow up of the AE, after the date of study drug discontinuation, is required if the AE or its sequ elae persist. Follow up is required until the event or its sequelae resolve or s tabilise at a level acceptable to the investigator and the sponsor’s clinical monit or or his/her designated representative. 8.1.4 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events All SAEs (as defined below) regardless of treatment group or suspected relationship to study drug must be reported immediately (within 24 hours of the investigat or’s knowledge of the event) via an SAE report form and sent immed iately (within 24 hours of the treating physician’s knowledge of the eve nt) to the fax number specified at the beginning of this protocol. A SAE is any AE that: (1) Results in death, (2) Is life threatening, that is any event that places the subj ect at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred. It does not in clude an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death, (3) Results in in -subject hospitalization or prolongation of exist ing hospitalization , excluding admission for social or ad ministrative reasons (see further), (4) Results in a persistent or significant disa bility/incapacity, where disability is a substantial disruption of a person's ab ility to conduct normal life functions, (5) Results in congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received the study drug , (6) Is an important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require hospitalization when, based upon appropriate medical judgement, may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring i ntensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in -subject hospitalization , or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. In addition to the above criteria, any additional AE that the sponso r or an investigator considers serious should be immediately reported to the sponsor and included in the corporate SAEs database system."

For chronic or long term in -subje cts, in-subject admission also includes transfer within the hospital to an acute/intensive care in -subject unit. • Prolongation of hospitalization is defined as any extension of an in -subject hospitalization beyond the stay anticipated/required in relation t o the original reason for the initial admission, as determined by the invest igator or treating physician . For protocol -specified hospitalization in clinical studies, prolongation is defined as any extension beyond the length of stay described in the protoc ol. Prolongation in the absence of a precipitating, treatment emergent, clinical AE (i.e. not associated with the development of a new AE or worsening of a pre -existing condition) may meet criteria for ""seriousness"" but is not an adverse experience and thu s is not subject to immediate reporting to the sponsor. • Pre-planned or elective treatments/surgical procedures should be no ted in the subject’s screening documentation. Hospitalization for a pre -planned or elective treatment/surgical procedure should not be reported as an SAE unless there are complications or sequelae which meet the criteria for seriousness described above. Any SAE must be reported immediately (withi n 24 hours), independent of the circumstances or suspected cause, if it occurs or comes to the attention of the investigator at any time during the study period. Any AE/SAE with a suspected causal relationship to study drug administration occurring at any other time after completion of the study must be promptly reported. The following information is the minimum that must be provided to the sponsor Pharmacovigilance contact within 24 hours for each SAE: • Study number • Centre number • Subject number • AE • Investig ator's name and contact details • Subject sex • Nature and seriousness o f the event • Reason for the serious classification • Causality (related, not related) • Event Onset date • Outcome of the event (if available) and any action taken The additional information included in the SAE form must be provided to the sponsor or representat ive as soon as it is available.

The investigator should report a diagnosis or a syndrome rather than individual signs or symptoms. The investigator should also try to separate a primary AE considered as the foremost untoward medical occurrence from seconda ry AEs which occurred as complications. 8.1.5 Pregnancy Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the study drug has interfered with a contraceptive method. If pregnancy occurs during the study, the subject will be immediately withdrawn from the study treatment . The outcome of the pregnancy will then need to be collected post study. Prior to withdrawal from the study, the pregnant subject will undergo either Post Treatment /Early Withdrawal Visit for the DB Phase or the OL Extension Phase, as applicable, within 30 days of last study drug administration. Information regarding pregnancies must be co llected on the AE pa ge of the eCRF and reported to the sponsor using the Standard Pregnancy Outcome Report Form . The sponsor will request further information from the inve stigator as to the course and outcome of the pregnancy using the Standard Pregnancy Outcome Report Form. The investigator must instruct all female subjec ts to inform them immediately should they become pregnant during the study. The investig ator should counsel the subject, discuss the risks of continuing with the pregnancy an d the possible effects on the f oetus. Monitoring of the subject should continue until c onclusion of the pregnancy, which may involve follow up after the subject’s invol vement in the study has ended. Pregnancies with a conception date within 90 days after subject ’s last dose of study drug or completion of the study must also be reported to the investigator for onward reporting to the sponsor. 8.1.6 Deaths All AEs resulting in death, except death due to disease progression, either during the study period or within 30 days after the last dose of study drug, must be reported within 24 hours of the investigator’s knowledge of the event. For AEs leading to death, NCI CTCAE Grade 5 is the only appropriate grade (see Section 8.1.2.1 ). Deaths that cannot be attributed to an NCI CTCAE term associated with Grade 5 or that cannot be reported within an NCI CTCAE category as ‘Other’ have to be reported as one of these four AE options: • Death not otherwise specified ( NOS ), • Disease progression NOS, • Multi -organ failure, • Sudden death."

If the study drug is discontinued due to a SAE , it must be reported immediately to the sponsor’s designated representative (see Section 8.1.4 ). In all cases , the investigator must ensure the subject receives appropriate medical follow up (see Section 8.1.3 ). The investigator should assess the ongoing benefit risk for each subject during their participation in the study, in consideration of any AEs and the potential bene fit of continued treatment with the study drug or any alternative therapies. The study drug should be temporary discontinued in case of: • Severe unremitting gastrointestinal intolerance: NCI CTCAE Grad e ≥3 diarrhoea (Increase of ≥7 s tools per day over baseline; inc ontinence; hospitalization indicated; severe increase in ostomy output compared to baseline; limiting self care ADL) or vomiting (≥6 episodes (separated by 5 minutes) in 24 hrs; tube feeding, TPN or hospitalization indicated ) despite optimal antidiarrheal or antiemetic treatment. • Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus: NCI CTCAE grade ≥4 hypergl ycaemia (blood glucose >500 mg/dL, >27.8 mmol/L) that does not resolve to CTCA E grade ≤2 (fasting glucose ≤250 mg/dL, ≤13.9 mmol/L) with in 14 consecutive days after starting optimal antidiabetic treatment. • Pancreatitis: NCI CTCAE grade ≥3 amylase (>2x ULN) or lipase (> 2x ULN) with symptoms, or for >7 consecutive days without symptoms. • Acute renal injury: NCI CTCAE grade ≥3; Creatinine >3x baseline or >4.0 mg/dL or hospitalization indicated. • Hepatic impairment: NCI CTCAE grade ≥3 ALT (>5xULN) or AST (>5x ULN) or Bilirubin (> 2xULN ). • Any other adverse event or lesser severity of the adverse events listed above that, in the opinion of the invest igator, could jeopardise the subject's safety. The Investigator should assess whether perman ent discontinuation or reintroduction of study drug is appropriate in the event of recovery fr om any such adverse event, considering the assessment of the relations hip to the study drug, underlying disease, intercurrent illness or concomitant medications, and the overall benefit risk for the subject continuing in the study. 8.1.8 Reporting to Competent Authorities/IRBs /IECs /Other Investigators The sponsor will ensure that processes are in place for submission of reports of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions ( SUSARs) occurring during the study to the CA’s, IRBs /IECs and other investigators concerned by the study drug .

The principal i nvestigator and the sponsor will sign the protocol amendment . 12.1.2 Protocol Deviations, Violations, and Exceptions A protocol deviation is non -adherence to protocol specific study procedures or schedules that does not involve inclusion/exclusion criteria, primary objective evaluation criteria, and/or GCP guidelines. Dev iations are considered minor and do not impact the study. A protocol violation is any significant divergence from the protocol, i.e. non-adherence on the part of the subject, the investigator, or the spons or to protocol specific inclusion/exclusion criter ia, primary objective evaluation criteria, and/or GCP guidelines. Protocol violations will be identified and recorded, by study centre personnel, on the eCRF. In addition, protocol violations will be reported by the m onitor in the monitoring reports and an y other related study documents, as detailed in the monitoring manual. As a matter of policy, the sponsor will not grant exceptions to protocol specific entry criteria to allow subjects to enter a study. If unde r extraordinary circumstances such action is considered ethically, medically, and scientifical ly justified for a particular subject, prior approval from the sponsor and the responsible IRB/IEC, in accordance with the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), is required before the subject will be allowed to enter the study. If investigative centre personnel learn that a subject who did not meet protocol eligibility criteria was entered in a study (a protocol violation), they must immediately inform the sponsor. Such subjects will be discontinued from the s tudy, except in an exceptional instance following review and written approval by the sponsor and the responsible IRB/IEC, according to the applicable SOP. 12.2 Information to Study Personnel The investigator is responsible for giving information about the stud y to all staff members involved in the study or in any element of s ubject management, both before starting any study procedures and during the course of the study (e.g. when new staff become involved). The investigator must assure that all study staff memb ers are qualified by education, experience, and training to perform their specific respons ibilities. These study staff members must be listed on the study centre authorisation form, which includes a clear description of each staff member’s responsibilities . This list must be updated throughout the study, as necessary. The study monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study staff, including the investigator, and for ensuring their compliance with the protocol. Additional information will be made available during the study when new staff become involved in the study and as otherwise agreed upon with either the investigator or the study monitor."
101,page_101,"IPSEN GROUP A-US-52030-328 CONFIDENTIAL PROTOCOL FINAL (INCLUDING AMENDMENT #5): 28 JANUARY 2019 PAGE 102 12.3 Study Monitoring The investigator is responsible for the validity of all data collected at the si te. The sponsor is responsible for monitoring these data to verify that the rights and wellbeing of subjects are protected, that study data are accura te (complete and verifiable to source data) and that the study is conducted in compliance with the protoc ol, GCP and regulatory requirements. Monitoring will be conducted by a CRO , directed by the sponsor's Specialty Franchise Clinical Operations department. Contracted CRO assigned monit ors will conduct regular site vi sits. As the active treatment and placebo are not similar in appearance (see Section 6.1) two monitors will be assigned to each site. One monitor will be dedicated to conducting stud y treatment checks and accountability and will have no access to the su bject's data, files or assessments. The other monitor will be responsible for all other monitoring activities. The investigator will allow direct access to all relevant files (for all subjects) and clinical study supplies (dispensing and storage areas) for the purpose of verifying entries made in the eCRF, and assist with the monitor’s activities, if requested. A dequate time and space for monitoring visits should be made available by th e investigator. Electronic data capture (EDC) will be ut ilized for collecting subject data. The site must complete the eCRFs according to the subject’s visit and on an o ngoing basis to allow regular review by the study monitor, both remotely by the internet and during site visits. The central study monitor at the sponsor and/or at the assigned CRO(s) will use functions of the EDC system to address any queries raised while re viewing the data entered by the study site personnel in a timely manner. Whe never a subject name is revealed on a docu ment required by the sponsor (e.g. laboratory print outs) the name must be blacked out permanently by the site personnel, leaving the initials visible, and annotated with the subject number as identification. A Steering Committee will be composed of investigator and sponsor representatives to govern the overall scientific and operational management of the study. A specific charter may be developed to define role s and responsibilities. 12.4 Audit and Inspection Authoris ed personnel from external CAs and the sponsor’s authorised Quality Assurance personnel may carry out inspecti ons and audits (see Section 11). 12.5 Data Quality Assurance Monitored eCRFs transferred from the investig ational site to the assigned Data Management group will be reviewed (secondary monitoring) for completeness, consistency, legibility and protocol compliance."

For elec tronic data capture (EDC) studies the fo llowing regulations must be included: Food and Drug Administration (FDA), 21 CFR Part 11, Electronic Records, Electronic Signatures, and FDA, Guidance for Industry: Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Trials. In addition, this study will adhere to all local regulatory requirements. Before initiating a study, the investigat or/institution should have written and dated approval/favourable opinion from the IRB /IEC for the study protocol/amendment(s), written informed consent form, any consent form updates, subject emergency study contact cards, subject recruitment procedures (e.g. advertiseme nts), any written information to be provided to subjects and a statement from the IRB /IEC that they comply with GCP requirements . The IRB/IEC approval must identify the protocol vers ion as well as the documents reviewed. After IRB /IEC approval, changes will require a formal amendment. Once the study has started, amendments should be made only in exceptional circumstances. Changes that do not affect subject safety or data integrity are classi fied as administrative changes and generally do not require ethical approval. If ethically relevant aspects are concerned, the IRB /IEC must be informed and, if necessary, approval sought prior t o implementation. Ethical approval on administrative changes will be obtained if required by local/site IRB /IEC . 13.2 Informed Consent Prior to study entry, the investigator, or a pers on designated by the investigator, will explain the nature, purpose, benefits and risks of participation in the study to each subject, subject’s legally acceptable representative or impartial witness. Writte n informed consent must be obtained prior to the subject entering the study (before initiation of any study -related procedure and administration of the study drug ). Sufficient time will be allowed to discuss any questions raised by the subject. The sponsor will provide sample informed cons ent form. The final version controlled form must be agreed to by the sponsor, and the IRB /IEC and must contain all elements included in the sample form, in language readily understood by the subject. Each subject’s original consent form, personally signed and dated by the subject or by the subject’s le gally acceptable representative, and by the person, who conducted the informed consent discussion, will be retained by the investigator. The investigator will supply subjects with a copy of their signed informed consent. CCI"

In this instance approval should always be given by the IRB /IEC . It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that all subjects subseq uently entered into the study and those currently in the study sign the amended form. This is documented in the same way as previously described. Subjects who have completed the study should be informed of any new information that may impact on their welfare/wellbeing. The investigator should, with the consent of the subject, infor m the subject’s primary physician about their participation in the clinical study. 13.3 Health Authorities and Institutional Review Boards /Independent Ethics Committees As required by local regulations, the sponsor’s or designated CRO’s Regulatory Affairs group will ensure all legal regulatory aspects are covered, and obtain approval of th e appropriate regulatory bodies, prior to study initiation in regions where an approval is required. 13.4 Confidentiality Regarding Study Subjects The investigator must assure that the privacy of the subjects, including their personal identity and all personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. In eCRFs and other documents or image material submit ted to the sponsor, subjects will not be identified by their names, but by an identification code (e.g. identification number). Personal medical in formation may be reviewed for the purpose of verifying data recorded on the eCRF. This review may be conducted by the study monitor, properly authorised persons on behalf of the sponsor, the quality assuranc e unit, or regulatory authorities. Personal medic al information will always be treated as confidential. CCI"

The investigator must record all data relating to protocol procedures, study drug administration, laboratory data, safety data and efficacy ratings on the eCRFs provided for the study. The investigator, by comple ting the signature log, may formally designate authority to complete eCRFs to appropriately qualified staff having certified user access to the eCRF . QoL questionnaires will be presented to the subjects in paper format. Once completed, the original copy will be sent to the designated CRO in charge of data management. The investigator must, as a minimum, provide an electronic signature (e -signature) to each case report book to attest to the accuracy and completeness of all the data. If any changes are made to the eCRF, after a form has been electronically signed, the investigator will be required to perform an additional e -signature authorising agreement with any new information or changes to the eCRF. All corrections on the eCRF will be automatically tracked and a reason for change is always required. In the eCRF, the audit trail function will allow the changes made to be viewed on each item entered. 14.2 Data Management Electronic Data Capture (EDC) will be utilis ed for collecting subject data. Each site is required to have a computer and internet connec tion available for site entry of clinical data. All entries in the eCRF will be done under th e electronic signature of the person performing the action. This electronic signature consists of an individual a nd confidential username and password combination. It is declared to be the legally binding equivale nt of the handwritten signature. Only sponsor authorised users will have access to the eCRF as appropriate to their study responsibilities. Users must have successfully undergone softwa re application training prior to entering data into the eCRF. Data management will be conducted by a CRO, directed by the spo nsor’s Specialty Franchise Clinical Operation Biometry department. All da ta management procedures wil l be completed in accordance with the sponsor and the contracted CRO SOPs. Prior to data being received in -house at the assigned CRO, it will be monitored at the investigator site, (for further details please see Section 12.3 Study Monitoring). The paper subject questionnaires and other data documentation removed from the investigator site(s) will be tracked by the CRO and the monitor. A hard copy should be retained at site in the subject file. The sponsor will ensure that an appropriate eCRF is developed to capture the data accurately, and suitable queries are raised to resolve any missing or inconsistent data. The investigator will receive their da ta, from the clinical study, in an electroni c format (PDF files) which will be an exact copy of the eCRF, and will include the full audit trail, for archiving purposes and future reference."

Study documents should be retained until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there ar e no pending or planned marketing applications in an ICH region (that is at least 15 years) or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinu ation of clinical development of the produc t. However, these documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the sponsor. The investigator should take measures to prevent accide ntal or premature destruction of these documents. The final archiving arrangements will be confirmed by the monitor when closing out the site. The sponsor will inform the investigator, in writing, as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. If the principal investigator relocates or retires, or otherwise withdraws his/her responsibility for maintenance and retention of study documents, the sponsor must be notified (preferably in writing) so that adequate provision can be made for their future maintenance and retention."
