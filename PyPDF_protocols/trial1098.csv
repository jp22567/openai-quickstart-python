Overall rationale for the amendment The reason for the amendment is to clarify that exclusion criteria related to the PROs eC - SSRS and PHQ -8 pertain to both the screening and the baseline visit. Also, the wording for the eC -SSRS criteria, and the described assessment hereof, has been updated to reflect the report from the e C-SSRS. The wording in eTMF version 3.0 of the protocol was based on the paper version of the C -SSRS. Substantial changes to the original protocol are provided in the table below. When applicable, original text is cited in quotation marks (‘’) with deletions as strike through , additions in bold , and descriptive comments in italics . Minor editorial revisions have also been applied during this amendment without further indication . Substantial change s in Amendment 2 Affected Section(s) Rationale for change The header versioning (and front page) has been aligned with the eTMF versioning (the electronic archiving system). Hence, with this amendment the header version has been updated from version 2.0 to 4.0. All sections To align header versioning with the eTMF versioning. The “V11” column in the schedule of procedures is now marked “x” for the task “returning fumaric acid esters”. Panel 2 This was missing by mistake."

Any positive finding in history of suicidal behaviour (e.g., ‘actual suicide attempts’, ‘interrupted attempts’, ‘aborted attempts’, or ‘preparatory actions’) based on the eC -SSRS questionnaire at screening or baseline. Subjects with a history of suicidal behaviour. 13. Any positive finding in suicidal ideation of level severity 4 or 5 (‘some intent to act, no plan’ or ‘specific plan and intent’) based on the eC -SSRS questionnaire at screening or baseline . 14. A PHQ -8 score of ≥10 corresponding to moderate to severe depression at screening or baseline . Sections 2, 6.6, 9.3, 11.4.2.2 , 11.4.2.3 , and Appendix 1 Clarification that exclusion criteria related to the PROs eC-SSRS and P HQ-8 pertain to both the screening and the baseline visit. Also, the wording for the eC -SSRS criteria has been updated to reflect the report of the electronic version of the C - SSRS. The described eC -SSRS assessment has been updated to reflect the report of the e C-SSRS. Appendix es 5C and 5D , containing the paper version of the C-SSRS, have been deleted. Section 11.4.2. 3 and Appendix 5 Appendix es 5C and 5D in the previous version of the protocol were deleted since it was realized that they deviated slightly from the report of the electronic version of the C-SSRS (the eC-SSRS). Instead, further details from the eC -SSRS report format are included in the assessment description in Section 11.4.2.3 . Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality that occurs in approximately 2% of the population worldwide (Augustin et al. 2010 , Gelfand et al. 2007 , Rachakonda et al. 2014 ). Section 6.1 Clarification that psoriasis is chronic and associated with significant morbidity and mortality Planned quarter of last subject last visit (LSLV): Q1 2019 Q4 2018 Section 8.1 Updated planned time schedule due to recruitment challenges."

Doses up to 700 mg intravenously have been administered in clinical studies with no evidence of dose limiting toxicity. In the event of an overdose, the subject should be monitored and treated symptomatically, and supportive measures instituted at the discretion of the investigator. Section 10.2.2 Deleted since overdose has now been reported with use of brodalumab . The overdose did not lead to any adverse event. •Anaphylactic reaction or other severe systemic reaction to IMP injection . Section 10.8.1 “injection” is deleted since this criterion for discontinuing IMP qualifies for both brodalumab and fumar ic acid esters. Fumaric acid esters: The subject must bring used, partly used, and unused IMP including empty packaging material at every site visit for compliance check. At every dispensing visit and at the end of treatment (visit 12), the subject must return all used, partly used, and unu sed IMP including empty packaging material to the site. Fumaric acid esters: The subject must bring used/partly used and unused including empty packaging material of fumaric acid esters at every site visit. From visit 3 until visit 11, the unused fumaric acid esters tablets must be taken back home by the subjects for further use. At the end of treatment (visit 12) the subject must return all used/partly used and unused IMP including empty packaging material of fumaric acid esters. Section 10.9.3 The schedule for returning used, partially used, and unused fumaric acid esters has been updated to every dispensing visit . This change is implement ed to minimise the risk of any accidental usage of expired IMP. 11.4.2 Patient reported outcomes – Efficacy and safety Section 11.4.2 The header is updated to clarify that the PROs address both efficacy (DLQI and PSI) and safety (eC - SSRS and PHQ -8) The differences in response rates between treatment groups will be analysed using the Cochran -Mantel - Haenszel test with stratification by and weight group (≥100 kg or <100 kg). Section 13.3.5 Clarification of the primary analysis . A sensitivity analysis will be made where ineligible subjects randomised in error into the trial are excluded from the analysis. Section 13.3.5 This sensitivity analysis is included to assess/ limit inference based on ineligi ble subjects randomised in error into the trial ."

Fumaric acid esters have been selected as the comparator because it is an established systemic treatment of psoriasis in Germany. Primary object ive To compare the efficacy of subcutaneous injections of brodalumab to oral administration of fumaric acid esters in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are naive to systemic treatment Endpoints for the primary objective Co-primary endpoint s:  At least 75% improvement from baseline at Week 24 in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)  Static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) scale score of 0 or 1 at Week 24 Secondary endpoints:  At least 90% improvement from baseline at Week 24 in PASI  100% improvement from baseline at Week 24 in PASI  Change from baseline at Week 24 in PASI score  PASI improvement (%) from baseline at Week 24  Change from baseline at Week 24 in affected body surfa ce area (BSA) Trial design Randomised, open -label, active -controlled, parallel group, multi -centre trial with investigator -blinded efficacy assessments comparing the efficacy of subcutaneous injections of brodalumab to oral administration of fumaric acid esters in adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

Number of subjects A maximum of 204 subjects will be randomly assigned to study treatment such that more than approximately 102 evaluable subjects complete the trial. Number of trial sites Approximately 30 clinical sites in Germany Statistical meth ods The co -primary endpoints PASI 75 and sPGA (0 or 1) at Week 24 (end of treatment visit) will be evaluated on the FAS. Estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the response rates and treatment differences will be presented. The differences in resp onse rates between treatment groups will be analysed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test and weight (≥100 kg or <100 kg). The null hypotheses of no difference in response rates between brodalumab and fumaric acid esters will be tested against the two -sided alternative that there is a difference on a 5% level. Subjects who drop -out of the trial before Week 24 (end of treatment visit) will be regarded as non -responders. As supportive analyses for the co -primary endpoints, a logistic regression model with baseline PASI or sPGA and weight group will be performed, and further, the mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) for PASI described below will be used to predict PASI 75 for subjects without assessments at Week 24 for an additional Cochran -Mantel - Haenszel analysis. Finally subjects who drop -out of the trial before Week 24 will be LOCF imputed and analyzed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test. The trial is considered a success if superiority is confirmed for both primary endpoints. Coordinating investigator Ulrich Mrowietz, Prof. Dr. med.

It is a chronic polygenic inherited disease of uncontrolled cutaneous inflammation that manifests , in the majority of subjects , as plaque type ps oriasis, clinically seen as sharply demarcated, elevated, scaling, erythematous plaques located predominantly on the scalp, extensor sides of elbows and knees, and the sacral region (Griffiths and Barker 2007 , Langley et al. 2005 , Griffiths et al. 2007 ). These skin lesions can be painful, pruritic , and may cause significant emotional and physical discomfort ( Dubertret et al. 2006 ). In addition to skin manifestations, psoriasis is associated with multiple comor bidities, for instance arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and psychiatric conditions such as depression and anxiety (Griffiths and Barker 2007 , Gisondi et al. 2007 ). The majority of subjects with psoriasis has mild to moderate disease and can be treated with topical therapies (Menter et al. 2009 ). In subjects with moderate to severe p soriasis, phototherapy or systemic treatment , including biologic agents , are recommended (possibly adjunct to topical treatment ) (Menter et al. 2009 , Nast et al. 2012 ). 6.2 Experience with investigational medicinal product 6.2.1 Brodalumab Brodalumab is a recombinant fully human monoclonal immunoglobulin IgG2 -antibody that binds with high affinity to human interleukin 17 receptor A (IL-17RA) . Brodalumab is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy in EU , Japan, and USA . Blocking IL -17RA inhibits IL -17 cytokine -induced responses and results in reduced or normalised inflammation of the skin in subjects with psoriasis . Ixekizumab and se cukinumab share the same treatment target, by inhibiting the biological activity of IL-17A. But by blocking IL -17RA (the receptor), brodalumab also inhibit s the biological activity on this receptor by other interleu kins in the IL -17 family (namely, IL -17F, IL -17A/F he terodimer, and IL-17E also known as IL -25) (Gooderham et al. 2015 ). The dose regimen for brodalumab for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adult patients is 210 mg by subcutaneous injection at Weeks 0, 1, and 2 , and then 210 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W)."

The pivotal trials enrolled subjects of 18 to 75 years of age with stable moderate to severe plaque psoriasis diagno sed at least 6 months before the first dose of investigational medicinal product (IMP). At baseline, th e enrolled subjects had plaque type psoriasis with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of at least 1 2, static Physicia n’s Global Assessment (s PGA) score of at least 3, and at least 10% body surface area (BSA) involvement . In all 3 trials, brodalumab was superior to placebo (p<0.001) for the co -primary endpoints (PASI 75 and sPGA of 0 or 1) as well as the secondary endpoints at Week 12 (PASI 100, sPGA of 0, and PSI). At Week 12, brodalumab 210 mg treated patients achieved response rates of 86% for PASI 75, 80% for sPGA0/1 , and 44% for PASI 100 (AMAGINE -2 trial, EU summary of product characteristics ( SmPC )). Brodalumab safety : During the brodal umab development programme, the most commonly reported adverse reactions in brodalumab -treated subjects included arthralgia, headache , fatigue , diarrhoea , and oropharyngeal pain (see reference safety information in Appendix 6 ). There were no very common adverse reactions. During the brodalumab development programme, important identified and important potential risks have been identified to be further in vestigated after launch. These include serious infections, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) , and malignancies. These important identified and important potential risks originate from the product ’s immunomodulatory activity and are shared by biolo gics in general. Furthermore, suicidal ideation and behaviour (SIB) have been identified as a n important potential risks based on rare events occurring during the brodalumab development programme. A causal relationship between brodalumab treatment and SIB has not been established, and there is no known mechanism of action by which brodalumab would be associated with triggers of self -injurious or suicidal behaviour, such as depression, mood disorders , and affective disorders or behaviours (Chiricozzi et al. 2016 ). During the 12 -week placebo -controlled trial period in plaque psoriasis, infections were reported in 25.4% of patients treated with brodalumab compared with 23.4% of patients treated with placebo. The majority of infections consisted of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, urinary tract infections, bronchitis, and influenza, which did not necessitate treatment discont inuation. Serious infections occurred in 0.5% of"

Higher rates of fungal infections, primarily non -serious skin and mucosal candida infections were observed in brodalumab patient s compared to placebo patients, 1.8% v ersus 0.9%, respectively. Antibodies to brodalumab developed in 2.7% (122/4461) of patients treated with brodalumab for up to 52 weeks in psoriasis clinical trials (0.3% of these patients had anti -brodalumab antibodies at baseline). Of these patients, none had neutralising antibodies. No evidence of altered pharmacokinetic profile, clinical response, or safety profile was associated with anti -brodalumab antibody development. For further details, please see the EU SmPC for Kyntheum®. 6.2.2 Fumaric acid esters Fumaric acid esters have been used to treat psoriasis since 1959. An oral preparation containing dimethyl fumarate and monoethyl fumarate salts, Fumaderm®, is licensed in Germany for treating adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in whom topical therapy is not effective. It is available in two strengths, Fumaderm® Initial containing 30 mg dimeth yl fumarate per tablet and Fumaderm® containing 120 m g dimethyl fumarate per tablet. Systemic therapy with fumaric acid e sters i s based on an established dosing scheme with a gradual increase to improve tolerability, especially with regards to gastrointestinal side effects. The dose is adjusted on an individual basis according to the response to therapy and the occurrence of side effects. Fumaric acid esters efficacy : The response rate for fumaric acid esters is expected to be lower than for brodalumab . In a systemic review , the rate is reported to be on par with methotrexate (Smith 2017 ). Methotrexate (MTX ) for 24 weeks is reported to achieve at least PASI 75 in 51% of patients (Mrowietz and Warren et al. 201 7). In the European C onsensus , fumaric acid esters and MTX are considered slow -acting drugs and the e ndpoint should therefore be measured between Week 16 and Week 24 (Mrowietz and Szepietowski et al. 2017 ). In most reports on fumaric acid esters , clinical effects are from open studies and only few studies have been performed using evidence based criteria (Nast et al. 2012 ). For fumaric acid esters , the S3 guideline estimate s a PASI 75 in 50 to 70% of patients at We ek 16 (Nast et al. 2012 ). However, in a trial comparing fumarates versus MTX , only 39% of evaluable patients in the fumarates group had a ≥75% reduction in PASI at Week 20 (the rate was 32% in the MTX group) (Fallah Arani et al. 2011 )."
30,page_30,"TRIAL ID: LP0160 -1327 DATE: 17-APR -2018 VERSION: 4.0 PAGE 30 OF 108 In an observational study, mean PASI scores were reduce d from 19.84 to 7. 35 after 12 months (63% improvement) (Walker et al. 2014 ), and it was noted that several multi -centre trials had demonstrated the efficacy of fumaric acid esters in psoriasis with a PASI 75 in about 50% of patients . Fumaric acid esters safety : Very common adverse reactions include flushing, diarrhoea, and mild forms of lymphocytop enia and leukoc ytopenia. Common adverse reactions include gastrointestinal disorders (bloating, cramps, and flatulence), severe forms of lymphocytop enia, and transient eosinophilia . Trial t reatment discontinuation criteria specific to subjects in the fumaric acid esters group, are provided in Section 10.8.2 . For further details, see the SmPC for Fumaderm®. 6.3 Trial r ationale The rationale is to demonstrate added benefit of brodalumab versu s a selected systemic comparator in treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in Germany in subjects who have not previously received sy stemic treatment for psoriasis. Fumaric acid esters have been selected as the comparator because it is an established systemic treatment of psoriasis in Germany . 6.4 Justification for dose 6.4.1 Brodalumab 210 mg 2QW brodalumab by subcutaneous injections is the recommended dose in the approved label. In the clinical development programme, this dose regimen demonstrated improved skin clearance across the key efficacy endpoints of PASI 75 response, PASI 100 response, and sPGA success (0 or 1) , relative to the comparator ustekinumab . The 210 mg brodalumab dose has been established as a well-tolerated dose with few and manag eable AEs . 6.4.2 Fumaric acid esters Systemic therapy with fumaric acid esters is based on an established dosing scheme with a gradual increase in dosage to improve tolerability, especially with regards to gastrointestinal"

The do se is adjusted on an individual basis according to the response to therapy and the occurrence of side effects , as described in the label . 6.5 Benefit -risk assessment A positive benefit -risk assessment of brodalumab and fumaric acid esters has been granted by relevant regulatory authorities via the market authoris ation for each IMP in Germany. Further details on benefits and risks with each IMP are described in Section 6.2. 6.6 Ethical considerations The IMPs will be used according to the label in the indicated population , and therefore no ethical concern has been identified for this trial. The subjects will be followed using all relevant safety assessments for the duration of the trial. SIB, incl uding completed suicide, has been reported in patients treated with brodalumab. The majority of patients with SIB had a history of depression and/or suicidal behaviour . A causal association between treatment with brodalumab and an increased risk o f SIB events has not been established , and there is no known mechanism of action by which brodalumab would be associated with triggers of self -injurious or suicidal behaviour, such as depression, mood disorders , and affective disorders or behaviours (Chiricozzi et al. 2016 ). Subjects are monitored for depression and SIB by the Patient Health Q uestionnaire -8 (PHQ -8) and the electroni c self -rated version of the Columb ia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale questionnaires (eC-SSRS ). The investigator must discontinue subjects from trial treatment in case of any positive finding of suicidal ideation of level 4 or 5 , any positive finding in history of suicidal behavio ur, or a PHQ -8 score ≥15 corresponding to moderate ly severe to severe depression (see Sections 11.4.2.2 and 11.4.2.3 for description of th e PHQ -8 and eC -SSRS assessments ). Subjects with a recent history of depression (within 2 years), any positive finding of suicidal ideation ( eC-SSRS level 4 or 5), or any positive finding in history of suicidal behaviour (PHQ -8 score ≥10) are excluded from the trial."

Eligible subjects will be randomised 1:1 to receive one of the following treatments , after stratification according to body weight (<100 kg or ≥100 kg):  Brodalumab 210 mg , subcutaneous injections ; or  Fumaric acid esters , up to 240 mg dimethyl fumarate, oral administrations The clinical trial consists of 3 phases: The individual phases and visit structure are further described below and overviews of the trial design and scheduled procedures are displayed in Panel 1 and Panel 2. Screening phase (Week -4 to Week 0 ) A screening visit will take place up to a maximum of 28 days prior to the treatment phase. Before any trial related procedure is started , the subjects will receive the necessary written and verbal information and instructions , including the informed consent form (written informed consent) and the written subject information sheet. Each subject will receive a unique subject number and eligibility will be determined by clinical examination and confirmation of subject selection criteria. Treatment phase (Week 0 to Week 24) The start of the treatment phase is defined as Week 0 ( baseline ). At this visit, eligibility will be confirmed by re-check ing the eligibility criteria in subjects who were eligible based on previous examinations and the lab results received from central lab for the samples taken at the screening visit . The invest igator must e nsure that lab values which are used to assess eligibility have been received and reviewed. If still eligible , the subject will continue in the trial and receive a unique randomisation number that determines the application scheme of IMP for the individual subject (see Section 10.3). Baseline, efficacy, and safety assessments during the trial are described in Section 11. Effica cy assessments are performed by an assessor blinded to treatment."

Trial s chedule The duration of the trial is planned as follows:  Planned quarter of first subject first visit (FSFV) : Q4 2017  Planned quarter of last subject first visit (LSFV): Q 2 2018  Planned quarter of last subject last visit (LSLV) : Q1 2019 8.2 Number of subjects needed Assuming a screening failure rate of 15%, approximately 240 subjects will be screened to obtain 204 randomised subjects . The statistical power considerations for this sample size (n=204) are described in Section 13.1. The trial will be conducted at approximately 30 sites in Germany. 8.3 Scientific rationale for trial design Randomised treatment allocation is applied as a methodology to reduce confounding by equalising factors (independent variables) not accounted for in the experimental design. Open -label treatment with blinded efficacy assessment is applied since the route of administration differs, and since the complexity of applying double dummy blinding i s considered inappropriate due to the individual dose adjustment scheme of fumaric acid esters . A blinded assessor will perform all efficacy assessment not knowing the assigned treatment, while the investigator will be unblinded. The investigator is unblin ded since dose adjustmen t may be necessary for subjects randomised to fumaric acid esters. A parallel design is applied to ensure correct temporal evaluation and to avoid any carry ov er effect from one treatment period to another, acknowledging the fact th at, especially for biologic treatments, the effect may continue for weeks to months after treatment cessation."

Treat ment assignment will be pre -planned according to a computer generated randomi sation schedule in a 1:1 ratio. Randomis ation will be with stratification by body weight (<100 kg or ≥100 kg) using an IWRS system. Each investigator site will be supplied with sufficient IMPs for the trial on an on going basis controlled by the IWRS . 10.3.2 Blinding This is an open -label trial. Due to potential dose adjustments needed for subjects randomised to fumaric acid esters , the invest igator and subject will need to know the treatment allocat ed. Furthermore, applying double dummy blinding is considered too demanding from a subject perspective, since home treatment would then involve both subcutaneous injections and oral administrations at varying time points. Blinded assessments of PASI, sPGA , BSA , and NAPSI will be performed. Blinded assessors who perform the assessment must be medically qualified physicians trained in the assessments . During the assessments, the subjects will be instru cted not to reveal the treatment allocation and the blinded assessor must avoid asking questions that could reveal treatment allocation. All involved personnel will be instructed to desist from any discussio ns regarding safety, efficacy, treatment allocati on of the study and subjects in the presence o f the blinded assessor. In case a blinded assessor becomes unblinded , a new assessor should be appointed to perform the assessments of the subject going forward. If possible, each subject should have their asse ssments done by the same assessor throughout the trial. Extra care should be taken to ensure that the same blinded assessor performs the baseline and end of treatment visit ( Week 24 ) assessments , where the co-primary endpoint s are assessed. If necessary, trial visits may be rescheduled within the specified window to accommodate when the specific assessor will be available. 10.3.3 Emergency unblinding of individual subject treatment Not applicable.

Prior to their return, they must be fully accounted for by the monit or with the help of the person responsible for dispensing the IMPs. Accountability must be documented by using drug accounta bility forms. The CRA w ill only do drug accountability by verifying the drug accountability performed by the investigator or designated site staff. IMPs may be returned from the trial site either to the CMO directly or v ia the LEO Pharma A/S affiliate or CRO responsible for running the clinical trial. 10.9.4 Investigational medicinal product destruction Used and unused IMP(s) will be destroyed by the CMO according to approved procedures. 10.9.5 Treatment c ompliance Throughout the trial, the investigator will remind the subjects to follow the trial procedures and requirements to ensure subject treatment compliance. Treatment compliance will be assessed by monitoring of drug accountability , see Section 10.9.3 , and from interviewing the subject s. If a subject is found to be non -compliant, the (sub)investigator should remind the subject of the importance of following the instructions given , including taking the IMPs as prescribed. Compliance/non -compliance and the reason for it must be recorded in the eCRF. The date of first dose of IMP (baseline visit/Day 0 ) must be recorded in the eCRF. For subsequent visits in the treatment phase , the investigator must record the latest date o f IMP administration and total daily dose relative to the specific visit in the eCRF . For subjects randomised to brodalumab: The investigator must ask the subject about each dose and whether the full dose was injected . This should be recorded in the eCRF as either full dose, partial dose , or no dose injected. If either partial or no dose was injected , a reason for not in jecting the full dose must be provided. For subject randomised to fumaric acid esters: During the treatment phase (from baseline to Week 24), the investigator must record the prescribed total daily dose of fumaric acid esters in the eCRF. Based upon the effect and adverse events reported by the subject , the investigator should make individual dose adjustment. The investigat or must also record whether or not the subject follow s the prescribed dosing instruction .

Specific details for each assessment and procedure are described in the following sections. During the course of the trial from screening to the follow -up visit ( Week 26/32 ), unscheduled visits may be needed . It is at the discretion of the i nvestigator to decide which assessments should be performed at an unscheduled visit. Assessments/ procedures at any trial visit must be performed in the follo wing order:  ePRO: DLQI must be completed by the subject prior to all other trial procedures  Investigator -blinded assessments (performed only by adequately trained investigators; the same investigator should perform all the evaluations for a given subject throughout the entire trial period)  Safety and laboratory assessments  Other assessments and procedures  ePRO: eC -SSRS and PHQ -8 should be completed by the subject after AE reporting has been completed.

For details about previous anti -psoriatic therapy see Section 10.5. 11.4 Efficacy assessments 11.4.1 Blinded assessments The blinded assessor m ust make the following assessments at visits specified in the schedule of trial procedures : PASI, sPGA, BSA and NAPSI (see Panel 2). The assessments will be captured in the eCRF. The blinded assessor who performs the assessments must be a medically qualified physician trained in the assessments and must remain blinded to wards treatment of the subject t hrough the course of the trial . If possible, each subject should have their assessments done by the same assessor throughout the trial. Extra care should be taken to ensure that the same assessor performs the baseline and end of treatment assessments (Week 24) , where the co-primary endpoint s data is collected . If necessary, trial visits may be rescheduled within the specifie d window to accommodate when the specific assessor will be available. The trial site will maintain a written plan detailing which staff members are blinded/unblind ed and the process of IMP administration used to maintain the blind . 11.4.1.1 Psoriasis A rea and Severity I ndex (PASI) The blinded assessor will assess the extent of psoriasis and the severity of the cli nical sign s (redness, thickness and scaliness) by body region ( head and neck , upper extremities , trunk, and lower extremities ). The extent of psoriatic involvement will be recorded for each of the four regions ( head and neck, upper extremities, trunk, and lower extremities ) using the following scale:"

The blinded assessor will use the surface area of the subject ’s hand (palm and fingers) as a reference measurement to calculate the percentage of each body region that is affected b y psoriasis. One hand is approximately equal to 1% total BSA. Furthermore, the complete body surface area (BSA=100%) can be divided into regions that approximates percentages of BSA as follows: head and neck (10%), upper extremities (20%), the trunk includ ing the axillae and groin (30%), and finally the lower extremities, includin g the buttocks (40%) . 11.4.1.4 Nail Psoriasis S everity Index (NAPSI) The NAPSI scal e is an objective, numeric, and reproducible grading system for nail psoriasis that incorporates the many different features of nail psoriasis. For assessments in this trial (including selection of target nail), a nail is graded using the NAPSI scale by first dividin g the nail area with imaginary horizontal and vertical lines into 4 quarters. The following 8 clinica l features of nail psoriasis are then scored based on the number of quarters in which the feat ure is present (0 to 4) to arrive at a NAPSI score of 0 to 32 for each nail:  pitting  leukonychia  red spots in lunula"

Those subjects whose nail with the highest NAPSI score is 6 or above at baseline visit will have this nail (the target nail) followed for the remainder of the trial. If multiple nails have the same highest score, only 1 target nail will be followed. Subjects whose nail with the highest NAPSI score is 5 or less will not have a designated target nail. 11.4.2 Patient reported o utcomes – Efficacy and safety The subject must make self -assessments at visits specified in the schedule of trial procedures (Panel 2). The following assessments will be done by the subject and must be completed prior to any other procedure at the applicable visit. An ePRO tablet will be provided to the sites for the subject to use when answering the PROs at site. 11.4.2.1 Dermatology Life Q uality Index (DLQI) The DLQI is a validated questionnaire with content specific to subjects with dermatology conditions (Finlay and Khan, 1994 ; Appendix 5B ). It consists of 10 items addressing the subject ’s perception of the impact of their skin disease on different aspects of their quality of life over the l ast week such as dermatology -related symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school, personal relationships, and the treatment. Each item is scored on a 4 point Likert scale (0 = not at all ⁄not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; 3 = very much). The total score is the sum of the 10 items (0 to 30); a high score is indicative of a poor quality of life . The DLQI takes about 2 minutes to complete. The investigator must evaluate eligi bility of the inclusion criterion for the DLQI. 11.4.2.2 Patient Heal th Q uestionnaire -8 (PHQ -8) The PHQ -8 is a validated and widely used 8 item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale designed to clinically assess patients for symptoms and signs of depression (Kroenke et al. 2009 ; Appendix 5 C)."

The eC -SSRS divide s SIB into suicidal ideation (level 1 -5), suicidal behaviour, and non- suicidal self -injurious behaviour: Suicidal ideation  Level 1: Wish to be dead or not to wake up  Level 2: Non -specific thoughts  Level 3: Specific thoughts of method  Level 4: Some intent to act, no plan  Level 5: Specific plan and intent Suicidal behaviour  Actual suicide attempts  Interrupted attempts  Aborted attempts  Preparatory actions Non-suicidal self -injurious behaviour  Non-suicidal self -injurious behaviours The eC -SSRS takes approximately 3 to 10 minutes to complete. At all visits with sch eduled assessment of SIB, using the eC-SSRS, the questionnaire must be filled by the subject after all other visit activities have been completed."

This documentation must be in place before any eC -SSRS results are evaluated by the investigator. 11.4.2.4 Psoriasis symptom i nventory (PSI) Subjects will use an e PRO device to record their daily psoriasis symptoms using the P SI, a psoriasis specific patient reported outcome measure that has been developed on the basis of a literature review, in -depth physician interviews, psoriasis patient focus groups, and cognitive intervi ews (Bushnell et al. 2013 ; Appendix 5A ). The PSI consists of eight psoriasis -specific questions . Subjects will be requested to rate the severity of their symptoms in the last 24 hours from ‘not at all ’ to ‘very severe, ’ ranging from 0 to 4. Total scores range from 0 to 32 with higher scores indicating worse symptoms. The PSI takes about 3 minutes to complete. Site staff will train the subjec t on the proper use of the e PRO device at the baseline visit . Subjects should be instructed to complete the PSI once per day. The e PRO must be completed in the evening within a specified time window (f or the early termination visit only, the PSI may be com pleted earlier in the day ). The investigator should not question the subject ’s answers. The investigator must review the data for timeliness and completeness . Symptoms reported on the PSI will not be captured as AEs, unless they are specifically mentioned as an AE by the subject when they are asked the non -leading question: “How have you felt since I saw you last? ” All data collected as part of the PSI will be reported in th e trial report. 11.5 Safety assessments 11.5.1 Vital signs Following vital signs must be measure d:"

Once a subject leaves the clinical trial, the investigator should follow up on the outcome of all non -serious AEs classified as of possible/probable related to the investigational product for 8 weeks after last treatment for brodalumab or for 2 weeks after last treatment for fumaric acid esters , or until the final outcome is determined, whichever comes first. SAEs must be followed up until a final outcome has been established, i.e. the follow -up may continue beyond the end of the clinical trial . For SAEs which have stabilised and cannot be expected to recover during trial or safety follow -up periods, for example chronic illnesses, the final outcome should be considered recovered and a statement that the SAE has stabilised should be added to the narrative in the SAE form. Please note that the event s hould not be reported as 'recovered' in the eCRF and on the SAE form."

This is defined within the EU Directive 2001/20/EC as “…the occurrence of any new event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the investigational medicinal product where that new event is likely to affect the safety of the subjects, the sponsor and the investigator shall take a ppropriate urgent safety measures to protect the subjects against any immediate hazard. ” (EU 2001/20 /EC, article 10). If the investigator becomes aware of information that necessitates an immediate change in th e clinical trial procedure or a temporary hal t to the clinical trial in order to protect clini cal trial subjects from any immediate hazard to their health and safety, the investigator can do so without prior approval from LEO, regulatory authority(ies), or IEC(s). The investigator must immediately in form LEO - by contacting the clinical project manager or medical expert - of this change in the clinical trial procedure or of the temporary halt providing full details of the information and the decision making process leading to the implementation of the urgent safety measure. LEO must act immediately upon receipt of the urgent safety measure notification in accordance with the internal procedures, which are based on the EU guideline. 13 Statistical m ethods 13.1 Sample size The effect on psoriasis symptoms of subcutaneous injections of brodalumab will be compared to oral administration of fumaric acid esters in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are naïve to systemic treatment. Formally, this will be formulated by testing the null hypotheses of equality of proportion of PASI 75 response and sPGA (0 or 1) success to treatment with brodalumab compared with treatment with fumaric acid esters; against the alternative hypothesis that the two proportions differ. The s ample size is determined using Fisher's exact test for the two independent proportions under the assumption of a two -sided test of size 5%. Based on experience from previous trials with brodalumab and fumaric acid esters in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis, conservative estima tes for the proportion of PASI 75 responders of 80% for brodalumab and between 50% and 70% for fumaric acid esters (Nast et al. 2012 ) are used in the sample size calculation (using Proc Power in SAS version 9.4 ).

A dropout rate of less than 40% with brodalumab , a PASI 75 response rate will correspond to a total rate of responders of 48 %. For sPGA, the expected r ate of sPGA success is 37.4% with fumaric acid esters (Mrowietz and Szepietowski et al. 2017 ), while varying rates above 60% has been seen in the previous brodalumab trials.

Estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for t he response rates and treatment differences will be presented. The differences in response rates between treatment groups will be analys ed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test with stratification by weight group (≥100 kg or <100 kg). The null hypotheses of no difference in response rates between brodalumab and fumaric acid esters will be tested against the two -sided alternative that there is a difference on a 5% level. Subjects who drop -out of the trial before Week 24 (end of treatment visit) will be regarded as non -responders. A sensitivity analysis will be made where ineligible subjects randomised in error into the trial are excluded from the analysis. As supportive analyses for the co -primary endpoints, a logistic regression model with baseli ne PASI or sPGA and weight group will be performed, and further, the mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) for PASI described below will be used to predict P ASI 75 for subjects without assessments at Week 24 for an additional Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel analysis. Finally, subjects who drop -out of the trial before Week 24 will be LOCF imputed and analysed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test."

All AEs will be presented by preferred terms (PT) and primary system organ class (SOC). Treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs ) will be summarised, however, all AEs recorded during the course of the trial will be included in the subject data listings.

Contin uous data will be summarised using the mean, median, SD, minimum , and maximum values. In general, for endpoints evaluated as change from baseline and/or where a baseline adjustment is applied, baseline is defined as information collected at the randomisati on visi t (Visit 2), if not otherwise stated. If the assessment is not available at the randomisation visit but at the screening visit (Visit 1) then this will be used instead. All the analyses specified in the protocol will be reviewed in relation to the b linded data obtained and the statistical analysis plan update will be finalised before breaking the randomisation code. Any changes from the statistical analysis planned in this clinical trial protocol will be described and justified in the statistical ana lysis plan update (SAPU) and/or in the clinica l trial report dependent on the type of deviation. For endpoints evaluated over time , plots will be made to explore the trajectory with time. 13.3.11 Handling of m issing values Missing data for categorical endpoints wi ll be imputed with non -responder imputation. Missing data for continuous endpoints will be dealt with by a mixed model for repeated measurements . 14 References Augustin M, Reich K, Glaeske G, Schaefer I, Radtke M.

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. (ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, E6 (R1)). This definition includes:  accidental injuries, events related to trial pro cedures, reasons for any unfavourable and unplanned change in medication (drug and/or dose), clinically significant worsening of pre -existing conditions, or reasons for admission to hospital or surgica l procedures unless these were planned before enrolment . It also includes AEs commonly observed and AEs anticipated based on the pharmacological effect of the IMP. In addition, any laboratory abnormality assessed as clinically significant by th e (sub)investigator must be recorded as an AE. Serious adverse even t definition An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that  results in death  is life -threatening  requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation.

Personal data collected as part of the clinical trial will be transferred to/from the institution/investigator, LEO and third parties acting on behalf of LEO. Processi ng of personal data on behalf of LEO requires a written agreement between LEO and the relevant party which covers collection, processing and transfer of personal data in the clinical trial. In certain cases, an agreement on transfer of personal data may al so be requir ed. Investigators and LEO must ensure that collection, processing and transfer of personal data are in compliance with applicable legislation on data protection and privacy.

If an abnormal finding (vital signs, physical examination, laboratory tests) at any other visit than the (first) screening visit is considered by the investigator to be clinically significant, it will be reported as an AE in accordance with Section 12.2. Furt her, any clinically significant deterioration of a pre -existing condition as well as any new clinically significant sign, symptom or illness observed after screening will be report ed as an AE in accordance with Section 12.2. Source data For all data recorded, the source document must be defined in a source document agreement or similar document at each trial site. There must only be one source defined at any tim e for any data elements. Source data should as a general rule be recorded in the subject ’s medical record or other defined document normally used at the trial site. Source data not normally collected as a routine part of the clinical practice at the site m ay be entered on a worksheet. Clinical assessments/safety evaluations must be signed by medically qualified investigators. If the worksheet does not become part of the subject ’s medical record, the following should as a minimum be added to the subject ’s medical record:  Date(s) of conducting the informed consent process, including date of provision of subject information.  A statement from the investigator to verify that each of the eligibility criteria are met.  Subject ID.  The fact that the subject is parti cipating in a clinical trial in psoriasis including treatment with brodaluma b or fumaric acid esters for 24 weeks with a follow -up period of 2 or 8 weeks depending on treatment group .  Other relevant medical information. Trial monitoring During the course of the trial the CRA(s) will visit the trial site. These visits have the following objectives: (i) to perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that data entered into the CRF by authorised site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable fro m source documents; (ii) to confirm that the safety and rights of subjects are being protected;"
92,page_92,"TRIAL ID: LP0160 -1327 DATE: 17-APR -2018 VERSION: 4.0 PAGE 92 OF 108 and (iii) to confirm that the trial is being conducted in accordance with the currently approved protocol and any other trial agreements, ICH -GCP, and all appli cable regulatory requirements. The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the trial site ’s recruitment rate, the complia nce of the trial site with the protocol and GCP. In order to perform their role effectively, CRAs and persons involved in quality assurance a nd inspections will need direct access to source data, e.g. medical records, laboratory reports, appointment books, etc. If the electronic medical record does not h ave a visible audit trail , the investigator must provide the CRA with signed and dated printouts. In addition, relevant sit e staff should be available for discussions at monitoring visits and between monitoring visits (e.g. by telephone). Protocol complian ce Protocol deviations will be documented and notified to the investigator. Protocol deviations will be assessed by LEO and included in the clinical trial report . Sponsor audits, IEC review, and regulatory agency inspections The clinical trial will be subj ect to audits conducted by LEO or inspections from domestic o r foreign regulatory authorities or from IECs. Audits and inspections may take place during or after the trial. The investigator and the site staff as well as LEO staff have an obligation to coop erate and assist in audits and inspections. This includes giving auditors and inspectors direct access to all source documents and other documents at the trial site relevant to the clinical trial. This includes permission to examine, verify and reproduce a ny records and reports that are important to the evaluation of the trial. If the trial site is contacted for an inspection by competent authorities, LEO must be notif ied immediately. Data handling Subject data should be entered into the CRF as soon as poss ible after each visit in accordan ce with the requirements described in the Clinical Trial Agreement , if applicable . Queries for discrepant data will be generated automatically by the system upon entry or manually by the CRA, sponsor ’s medical expert, or th e data manager. All queries will be raised electronicall y within the electronic data capture system. This systematic validation will ensure that a cle an and consistent database is provided for the statistical analysis. An electronic PRO (ePRO) solution wil l be used to capture patient reported data (data from questionnaires completed at the trial site and e PRO device data). By the use of an ePRO, data"
93,page_93,"TRIAL ID: LP0160 -1327 DATE: 17-APR -2018 VERSION: 4.0 PAGE 93 OF 108 will be available immediately after data entry and available for monitors and site personnel, including the investigator, with read access only. The ePRO system is a separate application from the eCRF and data captured from the eCRF and the ePRO will be stored on different servers during data capture. Data from both systems will be included in the final trial database. External data transfers from vendors to LEO will be transmitted and handled via a secure file transfer protocol site. Transmissions of electronic data from external data providers and of ePRO data to the clinical database are illustrated in Panel 14. Panel 14 Transmission of electronic data CTR: clinical trial report; ECG: electrocardiog ram; eCRF: electronic case report form; ePRO : electronic patient reported outcome. Archiving of trial documentation The investigator at each trial site must make arrangements to store the essential trial documents including the investigator trial f ile (ICH -GCP E6 guideline) until LEO informs the investigator that the documents are no longer to be retained or longer if required by local regulations. In addition, the investigator is responsible for the archiving of all relevant source docume nts so that the trial data can be compared against source data after the completion of the trial (for example in case of an inspection from regulatory authorities). The investigator is required to ensure the continued storage of the documents even if the investigator leaves the tria l site or retires before the end of the required storage period."
94,page_94,"TRIAL ID: LP0160 -1327 DATE: 17-APR -2018 VERSION: 4.0 PAGE 94 OF 108 No records may be destroyed during the retention period without the written approval of LEO. No records may be transferred to another location or party without written acceptance from LEO. The destruction process must ensure confidentiality of data and must be done in accordance with local regulatory requirements. For archiving purposes, each investigator will be supplied with a copy of the eCRFs and ePRO data for all subjects enrolled at th e trial site. This is done after completion of the trial and before access to the eCRF/ePRO is revoked. Audit trail information will be included. eCRFs and ePRO data must be available for inspection by authorised representatives from LEO, from regulatory a uthorities and/or IECs. Appendix 4E: Registration, reporting and publication policy Basic information of this clinical trial will be registered in the global data registry, www.clinicaltrials.gov before the first subject enters into the trial. The trial ma y also bec ome registered in other online data registries, according to applicable law and regulations. Results of this clinical trial will be posted on the corporate website of LEO in accordance with LEO ’s Position on Public Access to Clinical Trial Inform ation, latest 12 months after trial completion. Results may also become reported in www.ClinicalTrials.gov, www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu and national data registries in accordance with applicable law and regulations after clinical trial completion or prem ature termination. In the case of a multi -centre trial the first publication will be a joint multi -centre publi cation. Multi -centre publications will be prepared in collaboration between LEO and the members of a writing group, which shall be appointed by LEO. Publication by an investigator of his/her trial results shall not be made public before the first multi -centre publication. If no multi -centre publication has been submitted for publication within 18 months after the clinical trial has been completed or terminated at all trial sites and all data have been re ceived, defined as database lock of the clinical trial, the investigator shall have the right to pub lish the results from the clinical trial generated by the investigator, subject to the following notice requirements: Prior to submitting or presenting a manuscript relating to the clinical trial to a publisher, reviewer or other outside person, the investigator shall provide to LEO a copy of all such manuscripts, and LEO shall have rights to review and comment. Upon the request of LEO, the"
95,page_95,"TRIAL ID: LP0160 -1327 DATE: 17-APR -2018 VERSION: 4.0 PAGE 95 OF 108 investigator shall remove any confidential information (other than results generated by the investigator) prior to submitting or presenting the manuscripts. The investigator shall, upon the request of LEO, delay th e publication or presentation to allow LEO to protect its inventions and other intellectual property rights described in any such manuscripts. In case the first multi -centre publication is still ongoing and has not been made public at the time of notificat ion, LEO and the writing group may also delay the publication or presentation if the manuscript is deemed to harm the ongoing multi -centre publication. In case of publications made by the investigator after the first multi -centre publication ha s been publi shed, the above -mentioned requirements must still be followed. LEO complies with recommendations from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors and with the positions of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associatio ns (IFPMA), European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA), Japan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (JPMA) and Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) on disclosure of information about clinical trials , trial results and authorship. Appendix 4F: Insurance LEO has obtained a patient insurance as well as a travel accident assurance covering the subjects in the present clinical trial in accordance with the national law and regulations. A copy of the condit ions of the patient insurance as well as of the accident insurance will be handed out to the subject with the informed consent. Appendix 4G: Financial disclosure Investigators will provide LEO with sufficient, accurate financial information as requested to allow LEO to submit complete and accurate financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate regulatory authorities. Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the clinical trial an d for app. 1 year after completion of the clinical trial, or for a longer period of time if required by local legislation. Appendix 4 H: Trial and site closure Premature termination of trial or trial site LEO, the investigator, the IECs or competent authorities may decide to stop the clinical trial , part of the trial or a trial site at any time, but agreement on procedures to be followed mu st be obtained. If a clinical trial is suspended or prematurely terminated, the investigator must inform the subjects promptly and ensure appropriate therapy and follow -up. As specified by applicable"
96,page_96,"TRIAL ID: LP0160 -1327 DATE: 17-APR -2018 VERSION: 4.0 PAGE 96 OF 108 regulatory requirements, the investigator or LEO must promptly inform IECs and provide a detailed written explanation. Relevant competent authorities must be informed. The trial must be terminated i f the perception of the benefit: risk ratio (judged from clinic al signs and symptoms, (S)AEs and/or remarkable safety laboratory changes) becomes unfavourable for the continuation of the trial. Reasons for the early closure of a trial site by LEO or investigator may include but are not limited to:  Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IEC or local health authorities, LEO ’s procedures, or GCP guidelines.  Inadequate recruitment of subjects by the investigator.  Discontinuation of further IMP development. Completion of trial Investigators will be informed when subject recruitment is to cease. Trial enrolment will be stopped at a trial site when the total requested number of subjects for the c linical trial h as been obtained, irrespective of the specific site ’s planned inclusion number. Trial sites will be closed upon trial completion. LEO will undertake arrangements for the collection and disposal of any unused trial material that the investiga tor is not required t o keep in his/her files. A trial site is considered closed when all required documents and tri al supplies have been collected and a trial site closure visit has been performed. When the randomisation code has been broken, the investiga tors will receive information about the treatment allocation for the subjects randomised at their respective sites and wil l be asked to record this in the subject ’s medical record. Appendix 4 I: Responsibilities The international coordinating investigator ( ICI) is responsible for the approval of the clinical trial protocol, including any amendment(s) and the CTR on behalf of all clinical tr ial investigators and as agreed to in an International Coordinating Investigator Agreement. Each participating investigator is responsible for all aspects of the clinical trial conduct at his/her trial site as agreed to in a Clinical Trial Agreement."

CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to a ny of the excipients:  Proline  Glutamate  Polysorbate 20  Water for injections Active Crohn ’s disease. Clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis; see S ection below ). SPECIAL WARNING AND SPECIAL PRECAUTIONS FOR USE Crohn ’s Disease There is limited data in patients with a history of Crohn ’s disease. Exercise caution when prescribing Kyntheum® to patients with a history of Crohn ’s disease. Patients with a h istory of Crohn ’s disease should be followed for signs and symptoms of active Crohn ’s disease. If patients develop active Crohn ’s disease, treatment should be discontinued permanently. Suicidal ideation and behaviour Suicidal ideation and behaviour, includ ing completed suicide, have been reported in patients treated with Kyntheum®. The majority of patients with suicidal behaviour had a history of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behaviour. A causal association between treatment wit h Kyntheum® and incr eased risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour has not been established. Carefully weigh the risk and benefit of treatment with Kyntheum® for patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behaviour, or patients who develop such symptoms. Patients, caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergen ce or worsening of depression, suicidal ideation, anxiety, or other mood changes, and they shou ld contact their healthcare provider if such events occur. Infection s Kyntheum® may increase the risk of infections."
102,page_102,"TRIAL ID: LP0160 -1327 DATE: 17-APR -2018 VERSION: 4.0 PAGE 102 OF 108 During the 12 -week placebo -controlled clinical trial period in patients with psoriasis, seri ous infections were observed in 0.5% of patients receiving Kyntheum® (see Section on undesirable effects ). Caution should be exercised when considering the use of Kyntheum® in patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection. Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. If a patient dev elops a serious infection, the patient should be closely monitored and Kyntheum® should not be administered until the infection resolves. No cases of active tuberculosis were reported from clinical trials. However, Kyntheum® should not be given to patients with active tuberculosis. Anti -tuberculosis therapy should b e considered prior to initiation of Kyntheum® in patients with latent tuberculosis. Vaccinations It is recommended that patients be brought up -to-date with all imm unisations in accordance with local immunisation guidelines prior to initiation of treatment with Kyntheum®. Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with Kyntheum® (see Section below ). No data are available on the response to live vaccines or the ri sk of infection, or transmission of infe ction after the administration of live vaccines in patients receiving Kyntheum®. Vaccination of infants Vaccination of infants with live vaccines following third trimester exposure to Kyntheum® should be discussed wi th a physician (see also Section on fertility, pregnancy and lactation) . Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy The safety and efficacy of Kyntheum® in combination with immunosuppressants, including biologics, or phototherapy have not been evaluated. INTERA CTION WITH OTHER MEDICINAL PRODUCTS AND OTHER FORMS OF INTERACTIONS Live vaccines should not be given concurrently with Kyntheum® (see Section on special warning and precautions for use ). The formation of CYP450 enzymes can be altered by increased levels o f certain cytokines (e.g. IL -1, IL -6, IL -10, TNF α, IFN) during chronic inflammation. Although a role for interleukin (IL) -17A and IL -17RA in the regulation of CYP450 enzymes has not been reported, the effect of brodalumab on CYP3A4/3A5 activity was evaluat ed in a disease -drug- drug interaction study."
103,page_103,"TRIAL ID: LP0160 -1327 DATE: 17-APR -2018 VERSION: 4.0 PAGE 103 OF 108 In patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, a single subcutaneous dose of 210 mg brodalumab increased the exposure of midazolam, a CYP3A4/3A5 substrate by 24%. Based on the magnitude of change in expo sure of midazolam, no dose adjustment of CYP3A4/3A5 substrates is necessary when administered concomitantly with Kyntheum®. FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION Women of childbearing potential Women of childbearing potential should use an effective method of contraception during treatment and for at least 12 weeks after treatment. Pregnancy There are no or limited amount of data from the use of brodalumab in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respec t to reproductive toxicity . Human IgG2 is known to cross the placental barrier and brodalumab is a human IgG2, therefore, brodalumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to av oid the use of Kyntheum® in pregnancy. As the metabolism of brodalumab is unknown in infants, benefit risk for exposure of the infant to live vaccines following third trimester exposure to Kyntheum® should be discussed with a physician. Breast -feeding It is unknown whether brodalumab is excreted in human milk. Brodalumab is a monoclonal antibody and is expected to be present in the first milk and at low levels afterwards. A risk to the newborn/infant cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to di scontinue breast -feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Kyntheum® therapy taking into account the benefit of breast -feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. Fertility No data are available on the effect of brodalumab on human fertili ty. Animal studies did not show any effects on male and female reproductive organs and on sperm coun t, motility and morphology ."

UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS Summary of the safety profile The most commonly reported adverse reactions in all Kyntheum®-treated patients were arthralgia, headache, fatigue, diarrhoea and oropharyngeal pain. Tabulated list of adverse reactions Adverse reactions from clinical trials (Table1) are listed by MedDRA system organ class (SOC). Within each SOC, the adverse reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. Within each frequency grouping adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In addition, the corresponding frequency category for each adverse reaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very rare (<1/10,000).

The majority of infections consisted of nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, urinary tract infections, bronchitis, and influenz a, which did not necessitate treatment discont inuation. Serious infections occurred in 0.5% of patients treated with Kyntheum® and in 0.2% of patients treated with placebo. Higher rates o f fungal infections, primarily non -serious skin and mucosal candida infections, were observed in Kyntheum® patients compared to placebo patients, 1.8% vs 0.9%, respectively. One serious case of cryptococcal meningitis and one serious case of coccidioidies infection were observe d in clinical trials (see Section on special warning and precautions for use) . Through week 5 2, the exposure -adjusted event rates (per 100 patient -years) for infections were 114.6 for patients treated with Kyntheum® and 118.1 for patients treated with ustekinumab. The exposure -adjusted event rates (per 100 patient -years) for serious infection s were 1.3 for patients treated with Kyntheum® and 1.0 for patients treated with ustekinumab. Reduced absolute neutrophil count During the 12 -week placebo -controlled clinical trial period in patients with psoriasis, a decrease in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was observed in 5.6% of patients receiving Kyntheum® , which was generally transient and reversible. Grade 3 and 4 have been observed occasionally. None of the Grade 3 or 4 ANC decreases in the psoriasis subset overall were associated with a serious infec tion. Neutropenia During the 12 -week placebo -controlled period of clinical trials, neutropenia was reported in 0.8% of patients treated with Kyntheum® compared with 0.5% of patients treated with placebo. Most adverse reactions of Kyntheum®-associated neutr openia observed were mild, transient and reversible. Neutropenia Grade 3 and 4 were reported in 0.4% of patients receiving Kyntheum compared to 0.2% of patients who received ustekinumab and none in patients receiving placebo. No serious infections were ass ociated with neutropenia. Immunogenicity Antibodies to brodalumab developed in 2.7% (122/4461) of patients treated with Kyntheum®"

Of these patients, none had neutralising antibodies. No evidence of altered pharmacokinetic profile, clinical response, or safety profile was associated with anti -brodalumab antibody development. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal produ ct. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions. When reporting a suspect ed adverse reaction of a biological medicine, the name of the medicine and the batch number should be included. OVERDOSE Doses up to 700 mg intravenously have been administered in clinical trials with no evidence of dose limiting toxicity. In the event of overdose, it is recommended that the patient be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse reactions and appropriate symptomatic treatment be instituted immediately."
