Hormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study drug, which may reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive method. In this case b. Two highly effective methods of contraception should be utilized from 30 days prior to the first dose of study medication, throughout the study, and for at least 5 2 weeks after discontinuation of CAB LA and RPV LA .CAB and RPV have demonstrated no impact on the pharmacokinetics of commonly used combined estrogen and progestin containing oral contraceptives. Neither CAB nor RPV induce or inhibit UGT or CYP enzymes which are the predominant metabolic routes of elimination for these products. The interaction has only been studied with levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol for CAB and norethindrone/ethinyl estradiol for RPV. The lack of a demonstrated interaction with a representative contraceptive supports use of CAB and RPV across a broad range of estrogen and progestin or progestin only hormonal contraceptives.

SYNOPSIS Protocol Title: A Phase IIIb, Randomized, Multicenter, Parallel -group, Non- inferiority, Open-label Study Evaluating the Efficacy , Safety, and Tolerabilit y of Long -acting Cabotegravir Plus L ong-acting Rilpivirine Administered Every 8 Weeks or Every 4 Weeks in HIV -1-infected Adults who are Virologi cally Suppressed Short Title: Study Evaluating the Efficacy , Safety, and Tolerabilit y of Long -acting Cabotegravir Plus L ong-acting Rilpivirine administered every 8 weeks in Virologically Suppressed HIV -1-infected Adults. 1.1. Rationale The 207966 (ATLAS -2M) study is being conducted to establish if human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV -1) infected adult participants with current viral suppression (HIV -1 RNA 50 c/mL) remain suppressed upon administration of a two - drug intramuscular (IM) long -acting (LA) regime n of cabotegravir (CAB) and rilpivirine (RPV) administered every 8 weeks (Q8W; every 2 months). This study is designed to demonstrate the non -inferior antiviral activit y of CAB LA 600 mg + RPV LA 900 mg administered every 8 weekscompared with CAB LA 400 mg + RPV L A 600 mg administered every 4 weeks (Q4W; monthly ) over a 48- week treatment period . ATLAS- 2M will also provide comparative data on antiviral activity, safet y, tolerability ,and patient satisfaction through Week 96. Two groups of participants w ith demonstrated virologic suppression will be enrolled into ATLAS-2M including participants who at Screening are 1) receiving oral standard of care triple antiretroviral therap y (SOC) or 2) receiving a two drug IM regimen of Q4W CAB LA + RPV LA . The majo rity of participant s in ATLAS-2M will rollover from the ongoing 201585 (ATLAS) trial and additional participant s on SOC will also be included in order to support a targeted total samplesize of approximately 1020participants. Participants entering on SOC treatment consisting of a stable antiretroviral ( ARV) regimen containing 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( NRTIs)plus an integrase inhibitor( INI), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor( NNRTI), or a protease inhibitor (PI),will therefore either enter as new study participants or will rollover from the ongoing ATLAS trial. All participants entering on Q4W CAB LA + RPV LA will be rolled over from the ATLAS trial. ATLAS is a Phase III, randomized, multicenter, parallel -group, non -inferiority , open- label study evaluating the efficacy , safety, and tolerability of switching to CAB LA + RPV LA from current INI -NNRTI-, or PI-based antiretroviral regimen in HIV -1-infected adults who are virologically suppressed. ATLAS participants rand omized to the SOC , “current antiretroviral” treatment arm, consisting of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI s) plus a third agent (INI, NNRTI, or a PI), or the CAB LA + RPV L A Q4Warm, who successfully complete Week 52 (at minimum) of ATL AS,and remain virologicall y suppressed (HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL) , will be eligible to enter ATLAS- 2M. Eligible participants entering ATLAS -2M on oral SOC (either from ATLAS or new participants) will be randomized (1:1) to the CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W or Q8W regim en 2019N406358_00"
18,page_18,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 19beginning with 4 weeks of oral lead-in withCAB + RPV to confirm tolerability prior to IM dosing with CAB LA and RPV L A. Eligible participants entering from ATLAS on the CAB LA+ RPV L A Q4W regimen will be randomized (1:1) to either continue Q4W injections or transition to Q8W injections in ATLAS -2M (without the oral lead- in). All participants who successfully complete Week 100 of CAB LA + RPV LA treatment in the Maintenance Phase will continue to have access to their randomized CAB LA + RPV LA regimen in the Extension Phase until CAB LA and RPV L A are either locall y approved and commercially available, the participant no longer derives clinical benefit, the participant meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation or until development of their ass igned CAB LA + RPV L A regimen is terminated. 1.2. Objectives and Endpoints Objectives Endpoints Primary To demonstrate the non -inferior antiviral activity of CAB LA + RPV LA every 8 weeks (every two months ) compared to CAB LA + RPV LA every 4 weeks (monthly) over 48 weeks in suppressed HIV-1 infected antiretroviral therapy (ART)-experienced participantsProportion of participants with plasma HIV-RNA greater than or equal to 50 copies/mL as per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Snapshot algorithm at Week 48 (Intent-to-Treat Exposed [I TT- E] population) Secondary To demonstrate the antiviral and immunologic activity of CAB LA + RPV LA every 8 weeks compared to CAB LA + RPV LA every 4 weeksProportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA <50 c /mL (c/mL ) atWeek 24, Week 48 and Week 96 using the FDA Snapshot algorithm (Intent- to-Treat Exposed [I TT-E] population) Proportion of participants with protocol- defined confirmed virologic failure (CVF) through Week 24, Week 48 and Week 96 Proportion of participants with HIV-RNA greater than or equal to 50 c/mL as per FDA Snapshot algorithm at Week 24 and Week 96 Absolute values and changes from Baseline in viral load and CD4+ cell counts over time including Week 48 and Week 96 2019N406358_00"

Overall Design Study 207966 (Antiretroviral Therapy as Long Acting Suppression every 2 Months- ATLAS-2M) is a Phase III, randomized, open -label, active -controlled, multicenter, parallel-group, non -inferiority study designed to assess the antiviral activity and safet y of CAB LA + RPV LA administered every 4 weeks compared to CAB LA + RPV L A administered every 8 weeks in approximately 1020adult HIV -1 infected participant s. Two groups of patients who fulfil l eligibility requirements will be randomized (1:1) to receive CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W, or CAB LA + RPV L A Q8W regimen for at least 100 weeks: Group 1: Patients randomized from current ART SOC therapy Patients randomized from current ART SOC therapy , including those enrolled to the “current ART” arm of the ATLAS study following comp letion of the Week 52 visit (at minimum), will begin oral therap y with CAB 30 mg + RPV 25 mg once daily at Day 1 for 28 day s (3 days) to determine individual safety and tolerability prior to receiving CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W, or CAB LA + RPV LA Q8W. For pati ents on SOC transitioning from the ATL AS trial, eligibility for ATLAS -2M can be determined once the final central lab results from ATLASare available and safety parameters have been reviewed. 2019N406358_00"
21,page_21,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 22Group 2: Patients currently receiving CAB LA + RPV L A Q4W Patients currentl y receiving CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W within ATL AS will be randomized at Day 1 to either continue Q4W administration or transition to Q8W administration of CAB LA + RPV L A. Eligible patients include those originally randomized to Q4W in the Maintena nce phase of ATLAS and those who transitioned from SOC to the Q4W regimen within the Extension Phase of ATLAS. The first injection visit for ATL AS-2M can be performed once the final central lab results from ATLAS are available and safet y parameters have b een reviewed, and the ATL AS Week52 visit (at minimum) has been completed. Participants will continue to receive CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W injections as scheduled within the ATL AS trial until their eligibility for ATLAS -2M can be full y evaluated and the partici pant is re-randomized (Q4W or Q8W) . If determined to be ineligible for ATLAS- 2M, those participants can elect to continue participation in ATL AS or withdraw from the ATLAS study . Participants in ATLAS -2M who successfull y complete Week 100 (without meeting study defined withdrawal criteria) will be given the option to continue to receive their randomized treatment (CAB LA + RPV LA administered Q4W or Q8W) in the Extension Phase until the randomized study treatment is either locall y approved and commerciall y available within the local sector (including through local public/government health sectors), the participant no longer derives clinical benefit, the participant meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation or until development of either CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W and/or Q8W is terminated. Alternatively , participants can choose to complete study participation and enter the 52- week Long-Term Follow -Up (LTFU) Phase of the study . Any participant who receives at least one dose of CAB LA and/or RPV LA and discontinues the CAB LA + RPV L A regimen for any reason will enter a 52- week LTFU Phase. Those participants must remain on suppressive highl y active antiretroviral therap y (HAART) for at least 52 weeks after the last dose of CAB LA and/or RPV LA. In order to achieve balance across the treatment arms, randomization will be stratified by prior CAB + RPV Exposure: 0 weeks, 1 -24 weeks, >24 weeks . The primary endpoint for the study is the proportion of participants with HIV -RNA greater than or equal to 50c/mL (Virologic Failure) at Week 48 as per Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Snapshot algorithm using the I ntent-to-Treat Exposed (ITT- E) population. The proportion of participants with plasma HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 48 using the FDA Snapshot algorithm (Miss ing, Switch or Discontinuation = Failure, ITT -E population) is a key secondary endpoint comparison. The sample size of 1020 provides 85% power to demonstrate non -inferiority in the primary endpoint at Week 48 using a 4% margin, assuming a true 3% failure rate for Q8W CAB LA + RPV LA and a 2% failure rate for the Q4W CAB LA + RPV L A arm and a 2.5% one-sided alpha level (using unpooled Z test statistic). 2019N406358_00"

Number of Participants The target population to be enrolled is HIV -1 infected virolo gically suppressed (HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL) patients on stable antiretroviral therap y (ART) including participants who have completed ,at minimum, Week 52 of the ATLAS study . It is anticipated t hat approximately 1020participan ts will be enrolled into ATLAS-2M. In addition to participants rolled over from the ATL AS study, additional participants on SOC treatment will be screened to supplement enrollment such that the study can be appropriatel y powered. A 15% screen failure rat e, for additional patients randomized from SOC treatment is anticipated. Participants will be enrolled from multiple countries which may include those countries activel y participating in the ATLAS study including Australia, Argentina, Canada, France, Germ any, Italy, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United States. Randomization will be stratified b y prior CAB + RPV e xposure: 0 weeks, 1- 24 weeks, >24 weeks. A goal of this study is to enroll populations who are underrepresented in clinical studies including approximately 25% women. To provide sufficient data to determine whether either gender is correlated with treatment response, sites are expected to take into account gender in their screening strategies. N=1020, randomized 1:1 to each arm and stratified by prior CAB + RPV Exposure # SOC Patients not transitioning from the ATLAS study must be on uninterrupted current regimen (either the initial or second cART regimen) for at least 6 months prior to Screening. Documented evidence of at least two plasma HIV -1 RNA measurements <50 c/mL in the 12 months prior to Screening: one within the 6 to 12 month window, and one with in 6 months prior to Screening. No history of virologic failure. No evidence of viral resistance based on the presence of any resistance -associated major INI, or NNRTI mutation (except K103N) from prior genotype assay results. No current or prior history of etravirine use. †Optional Extension Phase to continue randomized CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W or Q8 W at Wk 100 ¥Participants who withdraw from IM regimen must go into 52 week long term follow up phase if randomized regimen is not yet locally approved and commer cially available. 2019N406358_00"

Screening Phase (Up to 35 day s) Informed consent must be obtained prior to an y study procedures, including an y Screening assessment. Participants will be involved in a Screening period of up to 35 day s and may be re- screened once. Participan ts who are randomized into the trial and subsequently withdrawn from the study, for an y reason, may not be re -screened. Participants may be randomized as soon as all eligibility requirements have been confirmed at the site. For participants transitioning from the ATLAS study , eligibility to transition to ATL AS- 2M at Week 52 (at the earliest) will be determined once the final central lab results from ATLAS, following (at minimum) completion of the ATLAS Week 48 visit are available and safety parameters have been reviewed. Separate Screening Labs will be utilized to inform eligibility for ATLAS-2M; however, in some occasions and upon consultation with the Medical Monitor, individual lab results and safety data from the final visit of the ATLASstudy can be considered towards informing eligibility for the ATLAS -2M study as long as all other Screening and eligibility criteria are met. 1.4.2. Maintenance Phase (Day 1 up to Week 100) There are two way s in which study participants may transition to the L A regimen, ei ther directly from oral SOC or from Q4W dosing from ATLAS.

The oral lead -in period is part of the Maintenance Phase and will therefore be included within the 48 and 96 week anal yses. The final dosing of current daily oral ART regimen should occur the day prior to randomization to avoid overlap of treatment regimens however, if the parti cipant takes current ART prior to coming into the clinic, randomization and initiation of oral CAB and RPV should continue as planned for Day 1. At the Week 4a visit, safety assessments (including e.g., clinical chemistries) will be performed as per the T ime and Events Table to determine individual safet y and tolerability prior to the initial administration of CAB LA + RPV LA . Dosing of CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W or Q8W will initiate at the Week 4b visit once safet y labs from Week 4a are available and have been reviewed. 2019N406358_00"

Subjects receiving Q4W injections within ATL AS and randomized to receive Q8W injections in ATLAS-2Mwill receive doses of CAB LA 600 mg + RPV LA 900 mg on Day1 one month after their last Q4 W maintenance dose in order to align with day of study randomization. Subjects will not require an intermediate dose at Week 4 and will receive their next Q8W maintenance injections at Week 8 and Q8W thereafter. Participants transitioning from the ATLAS study and on CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W treatment will be randomized at Day 1 to either continue Q4W administration or transition to Q8W administration of CAB LA + RPV L A. The first injection visit for the ATLAS-2M study can be performed once the final central lab results from the ATLAS study are available and safet y parameters have been reviewed . Screening labs determining eligibility for ATLAS -2M can be collected at Week 48 (at minimum) for participants originally randomized to the Q4W arm within ATL AS. Scre ening labs for participants who recentl y transitioned from SOC to Q4W injections within the ATLAS Extension Phase may be obtained at ATLAS Week 56b (after completion of the CAB + RPV Oral lead- in period) or at a subsequent ATLAS visit after receiving one set or a short course of Q4W injections.

If the length of time between injections exceeds, or is projected to exce ed 9 weeks, the Medical Monitor must be contacted to discuss individual participant case management. The primary study analysis will consist of data collected through the Week 48 visit. A single repeat of HIV -1 RNA for an y participant with a HIV -1 RNA 50 c/mL at Week 48 or Week 96 must be performed . The retest should be scheduled as soon as possible (but no later than 4 weeks from the Week 48 or Week 96 visits, respectively ) and will inform the Week 48 or Week 96 virological endpoint, respectivel y. 1.4.3. Extension Phase Participants who successfully complete 96 Weeks of CAB LA + RPV LA treatment in the Maintenance Phase will continue to have access to their randomized treatment Q4W or Q8W CAB LA + RPV L A in the Extension Phase until study treatment is eithe r locally approved and commercially available within the local sector (including through local public/government health sectors), the participant no longer derives clinical benefit, the participant meets a protocol- defined reason for discontinuation or unt il development of either CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W and/or Q8W is terminated. For participants randomized to Q4W arm, dosing visits will continue to occur every 4 weeks with CAB LA 400mg and RPV L A 600 mg. For participants randomized to the Q8W arm, dosing visits will continue to occur every 8 weeks with CAB LA 600 mg and RPV L A 900 mg. Safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted as per the Time and Events Schedule. Participants choosing to not enter the Extension phase can complete their study participation at the Week 100 visit and enter into the LTFU Phase as required. Participants who choose to continue on to the Extension Phase will need to be assessed for eligibility and will continue on their current CAB LA + RPV LA regimen while 2019N406358_00"

A single repeat of HIV- 1 RNA for an y participant with a HIV-1 RNA 50 c/mL and < 400 c/mL at Week 96 must be performed. The retest should be scheduled as soon as possible (but no later than 4 weeks from the Week 96 visit). Participants wi th HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL upon retest are eligible to enter the Extension Phase. Participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥400 c/mL at Week 96 are not eligible to enter the Extension Phase, will not be allowed a repeat to determine eligibility , and will therefore be withdrawn from the study treatment .Eligibility to enter the Extension Phase for a ny participants with a retest HIV -1 RNA > 50 c/mL and <400 c/mL will require approval by the study Medical Monitor. Participants not eligible to enter the Extension Phase or choosing not to participate in the Extension Phase will end their study treatment and enter the LTFU until/unless the Follow-Up Phase is no longer required based on local approval of the assigned CAB LA + RPV LA regimen. Sites may be reimbursed for up to a one -month supply of antiretroviral medication to facilitate transition to non- study ART for participants that do not qualify for the Extension Phase. 1.4.4. Long-Term Follow -Up Phase Any participant who receives at least one dose of CAB LA and/or RPV LA and discontinues the CAB LA + RPV L A regimen for any reason must remain on suppressive HAART for at least 52 weeks after the last dose of CAB LA and/or RPV LA in order to prevent selective pressure on HIV and the potential for selection of resistant mutants. Investigators must discuss the choice of the follow- up HAART regimen with the Medical Monitor prior to initiating the new regimen with the participant. HAART therapy should be initiated within 4 weeks after the last Q4W injection, or within 8 weeks after the last Q8W injection . The LTFU will begin the day of the last CAB LA and/or RPV LA dose and continue for 52 weeks, or until the assigned CAB LA + RPV LA regimen is locall y approved and commerciall y available. Upon discontinuation from the Maintenance or Extension Phase, hese participants will complete Withdrawal assessments (see Section 5.5) and will then enter into the LTFU as per the Time and Events Schedule (Section 7.1). Participants will be assessed with clinic visits at months 3, 6, 9,and 12 during the Follow-Up Phase. Female participants of child bearing potential must continue to use adequate contraception methods (see Study Procedures Manual for list of accepted forms of contraception) for the entire year of follow up. In order to assure that participants have access to HAART during the LTFU , GSK may supply HAART regionally or reimbursement will be provided as needed during this phase. The LTFU Phase may be modified or terminated at an y time during the study for various reasons, e.g., better understanding of r isks of development of resistance as CAB and RPV exposures decline, regulatory approval and commercial availability , end of study timings, etc. This phase is considered study participation and participants will be followed on study during this time. Additional w ithdrawal assessments are not required for participants who do not complete the LTFUPhase. 2019N406358_00"

INTRODUCTION Current HIV treatment guidelines recommend first- line antiretroviral (ARV) regimens consisting of two nucleoside/nucleotide analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI s) as a “backbone” combined with a third agent from the non- nucleoside r everse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), protease inhibitor (ritonavir -boosted) (PI /RTV), or integrase strand transfer inhibi tor (INSTI) classes [ BHIVA, 2016; DHHS, 2016; EACS, 2017; IASUSA, 2016 ]. While these regimens are highl y efficacious and generall y well tolerated, there is growing concern about long- term toxicities, and great interest from patients and cl inicians in unique regimens that might avoid such toxicities, and to provide effective long -term antiretroviral therapy ART with the most streamlined and convenient regimens possible. The current paradigm in the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) involves life -long therapy with multiple antiretrovirals. This dependency on medical therapy requires additional improvements on the durability , safety and tolerability, and convenience of all antiretroviral classes. Fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) h ave greatly advanced HIV treatment by allowing simplification of dosing and reducing pill burden. However, a dherence to therap y is essential to achieve viral suppression and prevent emergence of resistance mutations. Among regimens of comparable efficacy , physicians and HIV-1-infected patients who receive ART rate total pill burden, dosing frequency , and safety concerns among the greatest obstacles to achieving adherence. Drug resistant virus eventuall y emerges in most patients who struggle with consiste nt adherence. Different HIV treatment modalities are being developed to help improve adherence and patient outcomes, and prevent resistance and transmission of the virus. There is also an increasing desire to develop nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhi bitor (NRTI)-sparing regimens for long- term treatment of HIV infection as an approach to 2019N406358_00"
30,page_30,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 31avoid known NRTI -associated adverse drug reactions and long -term toxicities. I n addition, while there are no currentl y approved two -drug regimens to maintain suppression, simplify ing treatment has long been a goal to increase treatment compliance and improve the qualit y of life for patients with HIV. Cabotegravir (CAB) is a potent integrase inhibitor that possesses attributes that allow formulation and delivery as a long-acting (LA) parenteral product. Rilpivirine (RPV )is a diarylpyrimidine derivative and a potent non -nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) with in vitroactivity against wild ty pe HIV-1 and select NNRTI -resistant mutants. RPV is a global ly marketed product available as oral 25 mg tablets [Edurant Product Information, 2015], and is also formulated as a LA product. Intramuscular administration of atwo -drug combination therapy with CAB LA plus RPV LA may offer a better tolerability and resistance profile, as well as improved adherence and treatment satisfaction in virologically suppressed patients. 2.1. Study Rationale The overall objective of the CAB LA + RPV LA clinical development program is to develop a highl y effective, well tolerated two drug long -acting injectable regimen which has the potential to offer improved treatment convenience, compliance and improved quality of life for individuals with HIV compared to current standard of care. Week 96 efficacy data from study 200056 (LATTE -2) demonstrated that 94% of patients on the CAB LA + RPV LA Q8W dosing arm and 87% of patients on the Q4W dosing arm maintained virologic suppression (HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL ), with both regimens being well tolerated. LATTE-2 results justify further evaluation of CAB LA + RPV L A dosing regimens. Study 201585 (ATLAS) is an ongoing Phase III study conducted to establish if human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infected adult participants with current viral suppression on a regimen with 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI s) plus a third agent, remain suppressed upon switching to CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W . The current study, 207966 ( ATLAS-2M)is designed to demonstrate the non -inferior antiviral activity of CAB LA 600 mg + RPV LA 900 mg every 8 weeks ( Q8W, every 2 months) compared to CABLA 400 mg + RPV LA 600 mg administered every 4 weeks ( Q4W, monthly) for 48 weeks. This study will also provide important long -term comparative antiviral activity , safety, tolerabil ity of these regimens through Week 96 of the Maintenance Phase of the study . Additionall y, eligible participants (HIV -1 RNA <50c/mL at Week 96) will be given an option to continue their randomized CAB LA + RPV LA regimen (Q4W or Q8W) in the Extension Phas e of the stud y. 2.2. Background It is estimated that 36.7 million people are currently living with HIV/ Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS)and that the worldwide epidemic continues to grow at a rate of two mill ion new infections and cause 1.1 million deat hs per year [UNAIDS , 2016]. ChronicHIV infection in adults continues to be characterized by increased development of resistant virus, increasing transmission of resistant virus and issues associated with long term t oxicity of ART. The current paradigm in the treatment of HIV involves life -long therapy with multiple antiretrovirals. This dependency on medical 2019N406358_00"
31,page_31,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 32therapy requires a need for continuous improvement on the durability, tolerability and convenience of all an tiretroviral classes. A study by the Antiretroviral Therap y Cohort Collaboration [ ART-CC, 2013] found that of more than 21,000 patients in a European and North American cohort on their first combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimen (either PI or NNRTI -based), 51% modified or interrupted their first cART regimen during a median of 28 months of follow-up with one third of interruptions occurring within the first 6 months of starting therapy. Forty percent of all treatment interruptions were due to the secondary side effects or toxicities of cART, 17% were due to the desire for simplification of the regimen and 14% were due to patient choice. These observations have led to numerous “switch” ART studies, designed t o understand the efficacy , safety, and tolerability of switching patients from one regimen to another. Previous studies have evaluated switches to ritonavir-boosted PI monotherapy in virologicall y suppressed patients [ Bierman, 2009 and Arribas , 2012]. These studies suggest that simplify ing from a three drug dual class regimen to a single boosted protease inhibitor may be a safe and effective option for the m ajority of participa nts studied, who have effectively maintained viral suppression. In the OLE study , virologically suppressed (HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL) HIV -1 infected participants receiving a lopinavir - ritonavir (L PV/r) + lamivudine (3TC) or emtricitabine (FTC) based NRTI regime n simplified to a dual regimen of L PV/r + 3TC or FTC. In a modified Intent -to-Treat (m- ITT) analy sis, dual therapy with LPV/r + 3TC demonstrated non -inferiority efficacy and comparable safet y to LPV/r + 2 NRTIs [ Arribas, 2015]. The 200056 study (GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2013N168152_05, Study [LATTE- 2]) is an ongoing Phase2b study designed to assess the induction of virologic suppression with CAB 30 mg daily + two NRT Is, followed by a maintenance period where subjects are randomized (1:2:2) to continue on oral CAB 30 mg + twoNRTIs or switch to an IM injection of CAB LA + RPV LA administered Q4W or Q8W. A total of 309 participants were enrolled and treated. During the Induction Phase there was a rapid and sustained decline in HIV-1 RNA, with 91% of participants (282/309) achieving HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL through 20 weeks of therapy. There was a single participant (with known compliance issues) with confirmed virologic failure during the Induction period. Virologic testing revealed no treatment emergent phenot ypic or genot ypic resistance in this participant. The primary endpoint for 200056 was the Week 32 proportion of participants with HI V-1 RNA<50 c/mL (Snapshot, I ntent-to-Treat Maintenance Exposed population [I TT-ME]). Following virologic suppression on three drug oral therap y in the Induction Phase, 286 participants qualified to enter randomization at the Day 1 visit, and were subsequently randomized 2:2:1 onto once every 4 weeks intramuscular (IM) injections with CAB LA + RPV LA every 4 weeks (Q4W), once every 8 weeks (Q8W) I M injections with CAB LA + RPV LA or continuation of oral CAB + NRTIs, respectively. Through 32 weeks of two-drug maintenance therap y, 95% (Q8W) and 94% (Q4W ) of participants on injectable dosing were virologic successes, compared to 91% of participants continuing three drug 2019N406358_00"
32,page_32,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 33oral CAB + NRTIs, meeting pre -specified criteria for comparability between the dosing arms. Week 48 was a secondary endpoint for 200056 , and permitted the evaluation of the two- drug long -acting combinations’ ability to maintain the virologic suppression demonstrated at Week 32 . At Week 48, 92% (Q8W) and 91% (Q4W) of participants receiving injectable dosing had a sustained virologic response (HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL) compared to 89% of participants continuing oral CAB + 2 NRTIs. Week 96 efficacy data from study 200056 (LATTE -2) demonstrated that 94% of patients on the CAB LA + RPV LA Q8W dosing arm and 87% of patients on the Q4W dosing arm mai ntained virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA <50 c/mL), with both regimens being well tolerated. At Week 48, 10 subjects met virologic nonresponse criteria (Q8W, n=8; Q4W, n=1; oral CAB +2 NRTIs, n=1). For the Q8W I M arm, 4 subjects with virologic nonrespons e at Week48 (HIV-1 RNA >50 c/mL) were re-suppressed with HIV- 1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week96 without a change in therap y. Of 5Q8W subjects with virologic nonresponse at Week96, two had HIV -1 RNA 50c/mL at Week 96 (one of which had HIV -1 50c/mL at Week48), one discontinued due to protocol- defined virologic failure at Week 4, one withdrew consent due to intolerability of injections at Week 8, and one withdrew due to investigator discretion at Week 48 while not suppressed (and subsequentl y confirmed as a protocol-defined virologic failure). One of the two subjects with HIV- 1 RNA >50 c/mL at Week96 remained on the study and had HIV -1 levels <50 c/mL at the next scheduled visit. Through 96 weeks, no subjects in the Q4W arm failed for virologic reasons. The Q4W subject with virologic nonresponse at Week 48 (HIV-1 RNA, 59 c/mL) remained on the study beyond Week 48 and had subsequent viral re -suppression with HIV-1 <50c/mL at Week 96. CAB LA + RPV LA was well tolerated through Week 96 for both the Q8W and Q4W dosing regimens, as demonstrated by a low discontinuation rate due to AEs, including injection site reaction (I SR) related AEs in either dosing arm, with no significant dose -dependent trends in safet y parameters. Through Week 96, the proportion of AEs leading to withdrawal during the stud y Maintenance Period was low across all arms (Q8W IM: n=2, 2%; Q4W I M: n=8, 7%; Oral CAB; n=1, 2%), with only one additional AE leading to withdrawal since the Week 48 anal ysis. Long-acting two class therap y consisting of CAB LA + RPV LA as an IM regimen has the benefit of being a NRTI -sparing regimen for long -term treatment of HIV infection which will avoid known NRTI -associated adverse drug reactions and long- term toxicities. Additionally , a two-drug combination ther apy with CAB LA plus RPV L A may offer a better tolerability and resistance profile, as well as improved adherence and treatment satisfaction in virologicall y suppressed participants improving the quality of life for patients with living with HIV. The primary objective of ATLAS -2Misto demonstrate the non -inferior antiviral activity of CAB LA 600 mg + RPV L A 900 mg every 8 weeks (Q8W, every 2 months) compared to CAB LA 400 mg + RPV LA 600 mg administered every 4 weeks (Q4W, monthly ) for 48 weeks. ATLAS-2M willalso evaluate long- term antiviral and immunologic ef fects, safety and tolerability, and viral resistance of the Q8W and Q4W regimens for a minimum of 100 weeks. In addition, ATLAS -2M will assess patient reported health- 2019N406358_00"

Benefit/Risk A ssessment Summaries of findings from both clinical and non- clinical studies conducted with oral and CAB LA or RPV LA can be found in the Investigator’s Brochures (GlaxoSmithKline Document Number RH2009/00003/06, 2016; RPV IB, 2017). The following section outlines the risk assessment and mitigation strategy for this protocol: 2.3.1. Risk Assessment Oral CAB and CAB LA (GSK1265744/GSK1265744 LA) Since CAB is in clinical development and exposure in humans with or without HIV infection is limited, the clinical safet y profile in humans has yet to be full y elucidated. The following risks have primarily been identified during routine preclinical testing and/or from the clinical trial experience to date and are considered of potential relevance to clinical usage in the context of this protocol. Additional information about the c linical experience to date and possible risks associated with treatment using CAB can be found in the Summary of Data and Guidance for the Investigator section of the IB. 2019N406358_00"

In most participants, transient transaminitis was explained by acute hepatitis C infection (majority ) and other systemic infections. In a small number of participants, there was not an alternative explanation, suggesting a mild form of drug induced liver injury (DILI) without hepatic dysfunction, which resolved upon withdrawal of treatment with CAB. All four participants with suspected DILI identified in Phase 2 HIV treatment studies, were receiving oral CAB. Exclusion criteria as described in Section 5.2 will prohibit participants with significant liver impairment based on screening liver chemistry including transaminases (AL T and Aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) as well on prior medical history . Participants with a history of chronic liver disease with ongoing inflammation and/or fibrosis will have additional confirmatory assessments to confirm suitability for entry into the study. A 4-week oral lead-in Phase is being implemented in this study, where all participants will receive oral CAB prior to the administration of IM CAB to assess individual safet y and tolerability Liver transaminases (ALT and AST) will be monitored throughout this study (refer to Time & Events Table) and the liver chemistry stopping criteria will be adopted as described in Section 5.5.1.1of this protocol.

Hypersensitivity Reactions (HSR)Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported as uncommon occurrences with integrase inhibit ors, including the closel y related compound dolutegravir, and were characterized b y rash, constitutional findings, and sometimes, organ dysfunction, including liver injury . While there have been no clinical cases of hypersensitivity to CAB to date, there is a theoretical risk of s ystemic or severe hypersensitivity reactions with or without hepatic symptoms associated with use of IM CAB. The long exposures anticipated after IM CAB injection may complicate the management of a drug hypersensitivity reaction, were it to occur.The risk of developing a hy persensitivity reaction post administration of IM CAB will be minimized by the use of a 4 -week oral lead- in of oral CAB to determine individual safet y and tolerability prior to the introduction of IM CAB. Clinical assessments, laboratory tests (including liver transaminases) and vital signs will be performed throughout this study (refer to Time & Events Table, Section 7.1). Results from these assessments may aid early detection of HSR. Oral CAB will be withdrawn immediatel y for cases with suspected HSR during the oral CAB lead-in phase and would not proceed to the injection phase . Participants in the injection phase would not receive further injections. During oral and IM CAB treatment, any HSR reactions that occur would be managed supportively .

Other Clinically Relevant Information Additional details concerning safet y observations from clinical studies and for which a causal association has not beenestablished or which are of minimal clinical significance may be found in the Investigator’s Brochures ( GlaxoSmithKline Document Number RH2009/00003/06 [CAB IB], RPV IB, 2017). Adverse Events of Special Interest: Seizure Three cases of seizures have occurred in the cabotegravir programme cumulatively through 15 May 2016. Two of the cases occurred in HIV uninfected subjects with a prior history of seizure and one case involved a subject in study 200056 with circumstantial and anecdotal evidence of illicit drug use. Overall, there is not convincing evidence that cabotegravir exposure may be causally associated with seizure or with reduction of seizure threshold, due to the low frequ ency of reports, the confounders present in the cases received to date and lack of an y pre-clinical signal or identified plausible mechanism. However ,seizure and seizure -like events are considered as AEs of special interest for close monitoring in future studies. Subjects with anunstable or poorly controlled seizure disorder will be excluded from study participation. All cases of prior seizure history should be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to enrolment . 2.3.2. Benefit A ssessment The antiviral activit y against HI V-1 of CAB has been well established through Phase 2a and Phase 2b studies. RPV is an established antiviral agent against HIV -1 in treatment naive patients, with long term durability (>96 weeks in Phase 3 and >240 weeks in Phase IIb). Participants receiving CAB LA + RPV LA are anticipated to benefit from maintenance of virological suppression using LA agents. Pa rticipants randomized to receive CAB LA+ RPV LA Q4W or Q8W weekl y dosing will not need to take concomitant daily oral therapy. Adherenc e in these participants is expected to be improved and will be directly observed durin g IM injections. Efficacy of thistwo-drug regimen, as IM agents, has b een demonstrated through Week 96 of the ongoing 200056 study . The reduction in ART, and the discont inuation of NRTI s, may offer long term safet y and tolerability benefits in these participants. 2.3.3. Overall Benefit:Risk Conclusion Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to participants participating in this study , the potential risks identifi ed in association with CAB LA and RPV LA Q4W and Q8W regimens, and the study as a whole are justified by the anticipated benefits that may be afforded to treatment -experienced patients with HI V-1 infection. 2019N406358_00"

The first injection visit for ATLAS -2M can be performed once the final central lab results from ATLAS are available and safet y parameters have been reviewed, and the ATLAS Week 52 visit (at minimum) has been completed. Participants will continue to receive CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W injections as scheduled within the ATLAS trial until their eligibility for ATLAS -2M can be fully evaluated and the participant is re - randomized (Q4W or Q8W) . If determined to be ineligible for ATLAS- 2M, those participants can elect to continue participation in ATLAS or withdraw from the ATLAS study. Participants in ATLAS -2M who successfull y complete Week 100 (without meeting stud y defined withdrawal criteria) will be given the option to continue to receive their randomized treatment (CAB LA + RPV LA administered Q4W or Q8W) in the Extens ion Phase until the randomized study treatment is either locall y approved and commercially available within the local sector (includin g through local public/government health sectors), the participant no longer derives clinical benefit, the participant meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation or until development of either CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W and/or Q8W is terminated. Alterna tively, participants can choose to complete study participation and enter the 52- week LTFUPhase of the study . Any participant who receives at least one dose of CAB LA and/or RPV LA and discontinues the CAB LA + RPV L A regimen for any reason will enter a 52-week LTFU Phase. Those participants must remain on suppressive highl y active antiretroviral therap y (HAART) for at least 52 weeks after the last dose of CAB LA and/or RPV LA. In order to achieve balance across the treatment arms, randomization will be stratified b y prior CAB + RPV Exposure: 0 weeks, 1 -24 weeks, >24 weeks . The primary endpoint for the study is the proportion of participants with HIV -RNA greater than or equal to 50c/mL(Virologic Failure) at Week 48 as per Food and Drug Administration ( FDA) Snapshot algorithm using the I ntent-to-Treat Exposed (ITT- E) population. The proportion of participants with plasma HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 48 using the FDA Snapshot algorithm (Missing, Switch or Discontinuation = Failure, ITT -E population) is a key secondary endpoint comparison. The sample size of 1020 provides 85% power to demonstrate non -inferiority in the primary endpoint at Week 48 using a 4% margin, assuming a true 3% failure rate for Q8W CAB LA + RPV LA and a 2% failure rate for the Q4W CA B LA + RPV L A arm and a 2.5% one-sided alpha level. 2019N406358_00"

The oral lead -in period is part of the Maintenance Phase and w ill therefore be included within the 48 and 96 week anal yses. The final dosing of current daily oralARTregimenshould occur the day prior to randomization to avoid overlap of treatment regimens however, if the participant takes current ART prior to comi ng into the clinic, randomization and initiation of oral CAB and RPV should continue as planned for Day 1. At the Week 4a visit, safety assessments (including e.g., clinical chemistries) will be performed as per the Time and Events Table to determine individual safet y and tolerability prior to the initial administration of CAB LA + RPV LA . Dosing of CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W or Q8W will initiate at the Week 4b visit once safet y labs from Week 4a are available and have been reviewed. Subjects receiving oral SOCtreatment and randomized to Q4Winjections will receive loading doses of CAB LA 600 mg + RPV LA 900 mg on Week 4b followed by maintenance injections of CAB LA 400 mg + RPV LA 600 mg every 4 weeks thereafter.

The primary study analysis will consist of data collected through the Week 48 visit. A single repeat of HIV -1 RNA for an y participant with a HIV -1 RNA 50 c/mL at Week 48 or Week 96 must be performed . The retest should be scheduled as soon as possible (but no later than 4 weeks from the Week 48 or Week 96 visits, respectively ) and will inform the Week 48 or Week 96 virological endpoint, respectivel y. 4.2.3. Extension Phase Participant s who successfully complete 96 Weeks of CAB LA + RPV LA treatment in theMaintenance Phase will continue to have access to their randomized treatment Q4W or Q8W CAB LA + RPV L A in the Extension Phase until study treatment is either locally approved and commercially available within the local sector (including through local public/government health sectors), the participant no longer derives clinical benefit, the participant meets a protocol-defined reason for discontinuation or until development of either CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W and/or Q8 W is terminated. For participants randomized to Q4W arm, dosing visits will continue to occur every 4 weeks with CAB LA 400mg and RPV L A 600 mg. For participants randomized to the Q8W arm, dosing visits will continue to occur every 8 weeks with CAB LA 600 mg and RPV L A 900 mg. Safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted as per the Time and Events Schedule. Participants choosing to not enter the Extension phase can complete their study participation at the Week 100 visit and enter into the LTFUPhase as required. Participants who choose to continue on to the Extension Phase will need to be assessed for eligibility and will continue on their current CAB LA + RPV LA regimen while eligibility is being confirmed. A single repeat of HIV- 1 RNA for an y participant with a HIV-1 RNA 50 c/mL and < 400 c/mL at Week 96 must be performed. The retest should be scheduled as soon as possible (but no later than 4 weeks from the Week 96 visit). Participants with HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL upon retest are eligible to enter the Extension Phase. Participants with HIV -1 RNA ≥400 c/mL at Week 96 are not eligible to enter the Extension Phase, will not be allowed a repeat to determine eligibility , and will therefore be withdrawn from the study .

Participants not eligible to enter the Extension Phase or choosing not to participate in the Extension Phase will end their study treatment and enter the LTFUPhase until/unless the Follow-Up Phase is no longer required based on local approval of the assigned CAB LA + RPV LA regimen. Sites may be reimbursed for up to a one -month supply of antiretroviral medication to facilitate transition to non- studyART for participants that do not qualify for the Extension Phase. 4.2.4. LTFUPhase –IM Regimen Only Any participant who receives at least one dose of CAB LA and/or RPV LA and discontinues the CAB LA + RPV L A regimen for any reason must remain on suppressive HAART for at least 52 weeks after the last dose of CAB LA and/or RPV LA in order to prevent selective pressure on HIV and the potential for selection of resistant mutants. Investigators must discuss the choice of the follow- up HAART regimen with the MedicalMonitor prior to initiating the new regimen with the participant. HAART therapy should be initiated within 4 weeks (7 days)after the last Q4W injection, or within 8 weeks (7 days) after the last Q8W injection. The LTFU will begin the day of the last CAB LA and/or RPV L A dose and continue for 52 weeks, or until the assigned CAB LA + RPV LA regimen is locally approved and commercially available. These participants will complete Withdrawal assessments and will then enter into the L TFU as perthe Time and Events Schedule . In addition, for participants who withdraw during the LTFU, the final visit will be considered the study withdrawal visit. Participants will be assessed with clinic visits at months 3, 6, 9,and 12 during the LTFU Phase. Female part icipants of child bearing potential must continue to use adequate contraception methods (see Study Procedures Manual for list of accepted forms of contraception) for the entire y ear of follow up. In order to assure that participants have access to HAART during the LTFU, GSK may supply HAART regionally or reimbursement will be provided as needed during this phase. The LTFUPhase may be shortened or terminated at any time during the study for various reasons, e.g., better understanding of risks of developm ent of resistance as CAB and RPV exposures decline, regulatory approval and commercial availability , end of study timings, etc. This phase is considered study participation and participants will be followed on study during this time. A withdrawal visit isnot required for participants who do not complete the LTFUPhase. The participants’ last on study visit will be considered as their withdrawal visit. 4.2.5. Dose Modifications: No dose reductions, modifications, or changes in the frequency of any components of each regimen will be allowed during the stud y beyond what is allowed within the protocol or directl y approved by the study Medical Monitor.

In exceptional circumstances, and in consulta tion with the Medical Monitor, I nvestigators may provide oral CAB and/or RPV as a short -term “bridging” strategy for participants who have begun CAB LA + RPV L A(see Section 6.8.1for additional details). Should a participant need “oral bridging”, sites must contact the Medical Monitor for guidance on treatment strategies prior to a missed CAB LA + RPV L A dose. Should a participant no t notify the site in advance, the Medical Monitor must be contacted for further treatment guidance. Supplementary study conduct information not mandated to be present in this protocol is provided in the accompany ing Study Procedures Manual (SPM), which is available on the online Study Web Portal . The SPM will provide the site personnel with administrative and detailed technical information. 4.2.6. Independent Data Monitoring Committee An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be instituted to ensure ex ternal objective medical and/or statistical review of efficacy and safet y in order to protect the ethical interests and well -being of subjects and to protect the scientific validity of this study. The IDMC will evaluate accumulating efficacy , tolerability , safety and PK of CAB LA + RPV LAQ8Wat predetermined times during the study . An interim futilityanalysis will be performed for the IDMC to evaluate the efficacy of CAB LA + RPV LA Q8W prior to the final anal ysis. Full details of the methods, timing, decision criteria,and operating characteristics will be pre-specified in the IDMC Charter. The interim futility analysis will be performed with the intent of having approximately 50% of participants reaching Week 24 and providing sufficient lead time to a llow the IDMC to review the data prior to an y participants reaching the Week 52 visit. A futility rule based on Bay esian posterior predictive probability approach will be applied to assess the probability that the CAB LA + RPV LA Q8W injectable regimen de monstrates non- inferiority to the CAB LA + RPV L A Q4W regimen, given the partial data set. The sponsor will remain blinded to this analy sis. In addition, the IDMC may also monitor the incidence of participants meeting Confirmed Virologic Failure (CVF) criteria through Week 48 to ensure that participants are not being sub -optimally treated in the CAB LA + RPV LA Q8Warm. Full details of the analy ses, estimated timing, and the decision criteria that will be used to determine regimen performance will be pre-specified in the IDMC Charter. 4.3. Type and Number of Participants The target population to be enrolled is HIV -1 infected virologicall y suppressed (HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL) patients on stable antiretroviral therap y (ART) including participants who have completed at minimum, Week 52, of the 201585 (ATLAS) study . 2019N406358_00"
61,page_61,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 62It is anticipated th at approximately 1020participants will be enrolled into ATLAS -2M. In addition to participants rolled over from the ATL AS study, additional participants on SOC treatment will be screened t o supplement enrollment such that the study can be appropriatel y powered (See Section 9.1). A 15% screen failure rate, for additional patients randomized from SOC treatment is anticipated. Participants will be enrolled from multiple countries which may include those countries activel y participating in the ATLAS study including Argentina, Canada, France, Germany , Italy, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and the United States. Randomizati on will be stratified b y prior CAB + RPV Exposure: 0 weeks, 1- 24 weeks, >24 weeks. A goal of this study is to enroll populations who are underrepresented in clinical studies ,including approximately 25% women. To provide sufficient data to determine whet her either gender is correlated with treatment response, sites are expected to take into account gender in their screening strategies. 4.4. Scientific Rationale for Study Design The design of this study (1:1 randomized, open- label, active -controlled, multicenter, parallel group, non -inferiority study) is well est ablished for confirming the non- inferiority of an investigational agent compared with an active comparator and is generally accepted b y regulatory authorities as rigorous proof of antiviral activity. Th e primary endpoint, proportion of participants defined as virologic failures by the FDA Snapshot algorithm is recommended in the FDA’s 2015 guidance document ( FDA, 2015) for assessing efficacy in Switch Trials. The key secondary endpoints, proportion with plasma HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL at Week 48 and Week 96, is also a well -established surrogate endpoint for prognosis of HIV -1 infection and disease progression. The Extension Phase will allow for a collection of longer term ef ficacy, safety and tolerability data for CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W and Q8W regimens. Various approaches to simplify a patient's antiretroviral therap y (ART) regimen, after achieving viral suppression, have been studied. Previous studies have evaluated switches to ritonavir- boosted PI monotherapy therapy in virologicall y suppressed patients [Bierman, 2009 and Arribas , 2012]. While the data from these studies have shown both long-termnon-inferiority and inferiorit y to continual Highl y Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART), they suggest that simplifying from a three drug dual class regimen to a single boosted protease inhibitor may be a safe and effective option for the majority of participants studied who have effectively maintained viral suppression. The 200056 (LATTE -2) (GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2013N168152_05) clinical trial evaluated a different simplification approach and serve d as proof of co ncept for ATLAS-2M. In 200056, HIV -1 RNA suppression was induced with a three drug antiretroviral regimen consisting of CAB + ABC/3TC FDC, and then participants switched to a two -drug two- class regimen consisting of CAB LA + RPV LA for the maintenance of HIV-1 RNA suppression. Res ults demonstrate that through 96 weeks on two-drug maintenance therap y,94% (Q8W IM arm) and 87% (Q4W IM) of subjects maintained virologic suppression (HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL) compared to 84% of subjects continuing oral CAB + 2 NRTI s. CAB LA + RPV LA was well tolerated through Week96 for both the Q8W and Q4W dosing regimens, as demonstrated by a low 2019N406358_00"
62,page_62,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 63discontinuation rate due to AEs, including injection site reaction (I SR) related AEs in either dosing arm, with no significant dose -dependent trends in safet y parameters. On the basis of200056 Week 48, and Week 96 data, Q4W and Q8W I M dosing are being progressedinto Phase 3 f or further clinical development , respectivel y. TheCAB LA + RPV LA Q4W regimen is currentl y under evaluation in the ongoing Phase III ATLAS study. The open- label design best suits the objectives of this study . A double -dummy design could not be undertaken give n thelogistical challenges of blinding each regimen. Because2 injections of each investigational produc t are administered at every visit, a double-dummy design would require all subjects to chronicall y receive 4 injections per Q4Wvisit (2 active and 2 placebo), which could be intolerable for patients. I n addition, the volume of CAB LA and RPV L A injections will differ signific antly between Q8W and Q4W IMinjections (3 mL vs 2 mL each) , it would not be logistically feasible to blind site staff nor patients from the study treatments being administered. Participants randomized to receive CAB LA + RPV LA Q8W I M administration will be required to participate in clinic visits approximately every 8 weeks while participants randomized to receive Q4W I M administration will be required approxima tely monthly clinical visits. Importantly, secondary objectivesof this study areto understand the acceptability , tolerability, and patient reported preferences to these novel injectable regimens. An unblinded study design supports collection of participant preference data in a way that would not be possible if a double -blind, double-dummy design were implemented. If the Q8W arm were required to receive blinded placebo injections every month, the value of comparing safet y, tolerability, and convenience of Q8W compared to Q4W administratio ns would be limited and include overly burdensome visit requirements for those randomized to Q8W administration. Additionally , the perceived value for participants to transition from the ATLAS stud y to ATLAS-2Mfor potential randomization to the Q8W regimen would also be limited and may resultin loss of patients with prior Q4W experience, thereb y limiting the abilit y to compare experience of Q4W and Q8W regimens within individual patients. Due to the complexities, lack of feasibility and limitations ofblind ing CAB LA and RPV LA injections f or Q8W compared to Q4W administration, this Phase 3b study is planned as open label. To maintain the integrit y of the trial, data aggregated by actual treatment group will not be made available to members of the Study Team in advance of the first planned sponsor analysiswhen all subjects have completed Week 24 (see Section 9.2.3.1) and will not be shared with Investigators until the primary analysis at Week 48. In addition, central randomization will be used to ensure that s election bias is avoided (see Section 6.2). Lastly, ascertainment bias affecting the primary efficacy anal ysis is unlikely since the primary endpoint is inherently objective, being primarily determined by HIV-1RNA laboratory assessment. The open label design should therefore have no impact on the analysis of study endpoints. 2019N406358_00"

Oral Lead -In Phase Participants entering the study from oral SOC will receive oral CAB 30mg + RPV 25 mg once dailyduring the 4- week oral lead -in phasetoconfirm tolerability prior to receiving CAB LA + RPV LA injectable treatment. Data from study LAI116181 [GlaxoSmithKline Document Nu mber2011N130484_00] have demonstrated that there is no clinically relevant drug -drug interaction following repeat oral administrat ion of CAB with RPV. Oral RPV 25 mg once dail y, the approved oral dose of RPV, has been administered in combination with oral CAB to HIV -infected participants in Phase 2b studies LAI116482 [( LATTE); GlaxoSmithKline Document Number 2014N216014_00] (CAB 10, 30, or 60 mg once dail y) and 200056 [LATTE -2] (CAB 30 mg, oral lead- in phase). The CAB 30mg oral dose was selected based on observed safet y and efficacy from the LATTE -2 study for use during the oral lead phase of Phase 3 studies 201585 [ATLAS] and 201584 [FLAIR] which are evaluating Q4W dosing of CAB L A + RPV LA. The present study will also use CAB 30 mg once dail y with RPV 25 mg once dail y during the oral lead -in phase. CAB demonstrated good short -term safety /tolerability and antiviral activity as monotherap y following oral administration of 5 mg and 30 mg once dail y. LAI116482 (LATTE) is an ongoing Phase IIb, dose- ranging study (randomized 1:1:1: to CAB 10 mg, 30mg, or 60 mg) evaluating the long -term efficacy and safet y of a two -drug, two- class, once daily combination of CAB + RPV in HIV -infected, treatment- naïve adult participants. Following a 24- week phase of induction of virologic suppression using CAB + 2 NRTIs, the regimen was simplified to oral CAB + RPV once daily at Week 24 and continued for an additional 72 -weeks (total comparative stud y duration of 96 weeks ; Margolis, 2015). The results of this study also informed the Phase IIb study 200056 (LATTE- 2) with intramuscular CAB LA and RPV L A. Comparable efficacy , safety,and tolerability were observed across all three CAB doses at the early dose selection and confir mation visits at Week 16 and 24 in LATTE. The proportion of participants who achieved the primary endpoint of HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL (Missing, Switch, Discontinuation=Failure [MSDF] algorithm) at Week 48 (24 weeks on Maintenance) remained consistently high across the CAB dose arms ( ≥80%) with a low rate of confirmed virologic failure ( Table 2). Across all dose arms, CAB achieved similar efficacy at Week 24 of Induction when co -administered with 2 NRTIs and at Week 96 when co-administered with RPV 25 mg once dail y (72 weeks on Maintenance) . Rates of virologic suppression through Week 96 (Maintenance) on the two drug regimen remained similar to that attained through Week 24 (Induction) on three -drug ART. 2019N406358_00"

Although CAB 30 mg was already selected based on short- term efficacy and safet y through Week 24, the observed durability of viral suppression through 96 weeks across all doses, p rovided further support for CAB 30 mg dose selection in Phase 3 and the present study. In addition, the 30 mg dose achieves CAB plasma trough concentrations that are greater than mean CAB plasma concent rations observed following CAB LA dosing which allows an adequate assessment of safety and tolerability prior to transitioning to the long -acting, Maintenance Phase of the stud y (Table 3). CAB has low risk of causi ng or being a victim of drug -drug interactions, and therefore, the selected 30 mg dose can be safel y used with most common concomitant medications without dose adjustment. CAB exposures are not impacted b y the presence of food; however, given that it will be co-administered with RPV which requires food for optimal 2019N406358_00"
65,page_65,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 66absorption, the recommended intake of oral CAB in the Phase 3 studies is with food at the same time as RPV. Overall, the efficacy and safet y data from the LATTE study, CAB exposure following LAadministration, and limited drug -drug interaction potential, support selection of the CAB 30mg dose for once daily administration with the approved dose of RPV 25 mg once daily during the oral lead -in phase of this study .

Long Acting Injectable for Maintenance Phase The safety and efficacy of a 2-drug regimen with CAB and RPV for maintenance of virologic suppression was established in L ATTE, as detailed in Section 4.5.1, and informed the Phase 2b study (LATTE-2) with CAB LA and RPV LA. Study 200056 (LATTE- 2) is an ongoing, Phase 2b dose -ranging study evaluating the long -term efficacy and safety of a two -drug, two -class combination of CAB LA + RPV LA given every 4weeks (Q4W) or every 8 weeks (Q8W), as compared to an oral three -drug regimen, for maintenance of virologic suppression in HIV- infected, treatment- naive adults. The first phase of the LATTE -2 study was a 20- week Induction Phase (16 weeks of oral CAB + 2 NRTIs, 4weeks of CAB + 2 NRTI s + oral RPV). Participants who were eligible to continue into the Maintenance Phase were then randomized (2:2:1) to receive IM injections of CAB LA every 4 weeks (800 mg Day 1 then 400 mg Q4W) or every 8 weeks (800 mg Day 1, 600mg Week 4, 600 mg Week 8, then 600mg Q8W) in combination with I M RPV LA every 4 weeks (600 mg Day 1 then 600 mg Q4W) or every 8 weeks (900 mg Day 1, 900 mg Week 8, then 900 mg Q8W), respectively , or to continue on their triple ART regimen. The Q4W dosing strategy was selected fo r further investigation in Phase 3 based on observed efficacy , safety,and tolerability at Week 48. B oth Q4W and Q8W regimens were continued throughout the Maintenance Phase as planned, and Week 96 results (Table 4) were supportive of further evaluation of the Q8W regimen in the present study . Moreover, LATTE -2 was amended to permit subjects to remain on their randomized LA regimen (either Q4W or Q8W) during the Extension Phase (post Week 96), and those subjects r andomized to the oral comparator arm were allowed transition to either LA regimen at Week 96. Forty -four subjects were transitioned from the oral comparator arm to LA treatments in the Extension Phase; 34 (77%) opted for the Q8W regimen and 10 (23%) for t he Q4W regimen. I nitial LA injections were administered at Week 100 following a 4 -week oral lead -in where 2 NRTI s were discontinued and RPV 25 mg once daily was added to CAB 30 mg once dail y.

There are two way s in which study participants may transition to the Q4W regimen, either directly from oral SOC or directly from Q4W dosing from ATLAS.

Former ATLAS parti cipants receiving Q4W injections and randomized to the Q4W dosing arm of ATLAS-2Mwill continue receiving Q4W injections as scheduled. The predicted median (90% PI) stead y-state C for the proposed regimen is 84 ng/mL (41– 161ng/mL,Figure 14). With this regimen, >99% of participants remain above the 5th percentile of stead y state trough values following oral RPV 25 mg (corresponding to 2x the PA -IC90). With a loading dose of 900 mg RPV L A on Day 1, the anticipa ted median RPV C at Week 4 is 40 ng/mL , with >92 % of participants above the RPV PA - IC90.

Therefore, Day 1 = day of first injections for Study 207966 At steady -state, a one -week delay in dosing for the Q4W regimen is predicted to result in a median stead y-state C that remains above the median trough for oral RPV 25 mg once daily.

Inclusion Criteria A participant will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following criteria apply: Be able to understand and comply with protocol requirements, instructions, and restrictions; Understand the long term commitment to the study and be likel y to complete the study as planned; Be considered appropriate candidates for participation in an investigative clinical trial with oral and intramuscularl y injectable medications (e.g., no active sub stance use disorder, acute major organ disease, or planned long- term work assignments out of the country , etc.). The following are stud y specific eligibility criteria unless stated otherwise. In addition to these criteria, Investigators must exercise cl inical discretion regarding selection of appropriate study participants, taking into consideration any local treatment practices or guidelines and good clinical practice (GCP). All participants must be considered appropriate candidates for antiretroviral therapy in accordance with local treatment guidelines . Laboratory results from the central laboratory services provided by this trial will be used to assess eligibility . In exceptional circumstances only , if a repeat lab is required because a central lab result cannot be generated, local labs can be reviewed and approved by the Medical Monitor for consideration of participant eligibility . A repeat central lab will be submitted concurrentl y or at the next planned visit. Source documentation to verify entrycriteria must be reviewed b y the Principal Investigator or designee prior to randomization. Source documents from other medical facilities must be located/received during the 14 -day screening phase (or up to 35 day s) and under no circumstances may the participant be randomized in the absence of source documentation. 2019N406358_00"

Screening/Baseline/Run -in Failures Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical trial but are never subsequently randomized. In order to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants, meet the Consolida ted Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing requirements, and respond to queries from Regulatory authorities, a minimal set of screen failure information is required including Demograph y, Screen Failure details, Eligibility Criteria, and Serious Adverse Events. A single repeat of a procedure / lab parameter is allowed to determine eligibility (unless otherwise specified). Participants are allowed to re- screen for this study one time. This will require a new participant number. 5.5. Withdrawal/Stoppin g Criteria Participants permanentl y discontinuing study treatments prior to the Week 100visit are considered to be withdrawn from the stud y treatments. Participants who enter the Extension Phase but permanently discontinue participation in the Extension Phase prior to commerciall y available CAB LA + RPV LA are considered to be withdrawn from the study treatments but are not considered to be withdrawn from the study because they will enter the follow Follow -up Phase. A participant may withdraw consent and discontinue participation in this study at any time at his/her own request. The investigator may also, at his or her discretion, discontinue the participant from participating in this study at any time (e.g., safet y, behavioral or administrative reasons). Participants may have a temporary interruption to their study treatment for management of toxicities. If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any samples taken, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. Withdrawn participants will not be replaced. All participants who discontinue prematurel y from the study , irrespective of arm, will be asked for additional information to establish the reason for withdrawal. Participants are not obligated to st ate the reason for withdrawal. However, the reasons for withdrawal, or failure to provide a reason, must be documented b y the Investigator on the Completion/Withdrawal section of the electronic case report form (eCRF). Every effort should be made by the I nvestigator to follow -up participants who withdraw from the study. Ain-clinic withdrawal visit will also be used to assess participants with ongoing AEs, and serious adverse events (SAEs) related & not related to study drug and also any laboratory abnormalities that are considered to be AEs or potentially harmful to the participant. The withdrawal visit will be distinct from visits conducted during the LTFU Phase. 2019N406358_00"
90,page_90,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 91Following completion of withdrawal assessments , all participants who received one or more injections of CAB LA+ RPV LA will subsequently enter the LTFU Phase initiating with the Month 3 L TFU visit. Withdrawal decision coincides with a planned clinic visit: For any participant who withdraws prematurel y from the Maintenance or Extension Phase du ring a planned in- clinic study visit, withdrawal assessments and procedures are to be performed (according to the Time and Events Table ( Section 7.1) instead of the assessments for the active planned visit durin g which the withdrawal decision is made. Withdrawal decision occurs between plannedclinic visits: In the event that a decision to withdraw a participant occurs betw een clinic visits, participants will be instructed to return for an unscheduled withdrawa l visit (within 4 weeks of the last Q4W LA injection or within 8 weeks of the last Q8W LA injection received) during which withdrawal assessments according to the Time and Events Table ( Section 7.1) will be completed. For participants who received one or more injections of CAB LA+ RPV LA withdrawal assessments must occur prior to initiation of the next ART regimen . Ifwithdrawal coincides with the active planned Week 52 or Week 100 visits, HI V-1 RNA will only be assessed if the last HIV -RNA measurement from Week 48 or Week 96 was 50 copies per mL (i.e. retest for viral load blip). This will ensure that only the Week 48 or Week 96 viral load assessments or required retest will be counted towards the primary and secondary efficacy endpoint windows. The in-clinic visit will be recorded as an unscheduled withdrawal visit with the following exception. A withdrawal visit and assessments coinciding with the planned Week 100 visit will be recorded as the Week 100 visit such that the participant can be considered a completer, consistent with the definition of study completer in Section 5.6. Participants maybe prematurely discontinued from the study treatment for any of the following reasons: Adverse event / Serious adverse event Protocol deviation Intolerability of injections Participant lost to follow -up Participant or Investigator non- compliance; Termination of the stud y by the Sponsor At the request of the participant, I nvestigator, GSK or ViiV Healthcare; 2019N406358_00"

Safety data for all participants who receive any amount of study drug, including participants who withdraw from the stud y, will be included in evaluations of safet y. All data from the Withdrawal visit will be recorded, as they comprise an essential evaluation that should be done prior to discharging an y participant from the study. The following actions must be taken in relation to a participant who fails to attend the clinic for a requ ired study visit: a.The site must attempt to contact the participant and re- schedule the missed visit as soon as possible. 2019N406358_00"

These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record. d.Should the participant continue to be unreachable, only then will he/s he be considered to have withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of “Lost to Follow-up”. A participant may withdraw from study treatment at an y time at his/her own request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for s afety, behavioral or administrative reasons. If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of an y samples taken, and the investigator must document this in the site study records. 5.5.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria Liver chemist ry stopping and increased monitoring criteria have been designed to assure participant safety and evaluate liver event etiology . IP will be stopped if an y of the following liver chemistry criteria are met: ALT 3xULN and bilirubin 2xULN (>35% direct bilir ubin, bilirubin fractionation required). NOTE: serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, sites should evaluate the presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick, indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury. If testing is unavailable and a participant meets the criterion of total bilirubin 2xULN, then the event meets liver stopping criteria. ALT 8xULN. ALT ≥3xULN (if Baseline ALT is <ULN) with sy mptoms or worsening of acute hepatitis or hy persensitivity such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia, OR; ALT ≥3x Baseline ALT with sy mptoms or worsening of acute hepatitis or hypersensitivity such as fatigue, nau sea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia; ALT ≥5xULN and <8xULN that persists ≥2 weeks (with bilirubin <2 UL N & no signs or s ymptoms of acute hepatitis or hy persensitivity ). ALT ≥5xULN but <8xULN and cannot be mo nitored weekly for >2 weeks. 2019N406358_00"

Record alcohol use on the liver event alcohol intake case report form. 5.5.1.2. Liver Event A djudication Committee A liver safet y panel will be used to evaluate all participants who meet liver stopping criteria. Uniform sets of data and standards for adjudication will be applied across cases to inform outcomes. Full details of the anal ysis, timing, and the decision criteria will be pre-specified in an Adjud ication Committee Charter. 5.5.1.3. Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria –Restart/Rechallenge Participants who meet liver toxicity stopping criteria should not be retreated with investigational product unless an exemption has been approved b y the ViiV Safet y and Labeling Committee (VSLC). The guideline for Restart/Rechallenge approved by the VSLC, which is maintained as a separate document must be followed. 5.5.1.3.1. Drug Restart /Rechallenge. Following Liver Events that are Possibly Related to IP Approval b y the VSLC for drug restart or additional I M administration can be considered where: The participant is receiving compelling benefit, benefit of drug restart exceeds risk, and no effective alternative therap y is available. Ethics Committee or I nstitutional Review Boar d approval of drug restart /rechallenge must be obtained, as required. 2019N406358_00"
95,page_95,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 96If the restart /rechallenge is approved b y the VSLC in writing, the participant must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of drug administration, in cluding the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver injury or death. The participant must also provide signed informed consent specifically for the IP restart/rechallenge. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study chart. Study drug must be administered at the dose specified by the VSLC. Participants approved b y the VSLC for rechallenge of IP must return to the clinic twice a week for liver chemistry tests for a minimum of one month and thereafter for as long as clinicall y indicated and then laboratory monitoring may resume as per protocol. If protocol defined stopping criteria for liver chemistry elevations are met, study drug must be stopped. 5.5.1.3.2. Drug Restart Following Transient Resolving Liver Events Not Related to IP Approval b y the VSLC for drug restart or additional I M administration can be considered where: Liver chemistries have a clear underl ying cause (e.g., biliary obstruction, hypotension and liver chemistries have improved to normal or are within 1.5 xbaseline and AL T<3xULN). Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board approval of drug restart/rechallenge must be obtained, as required. If restart/redosing of drug is approved b y the VSLC in writing, the participant must be provided with a clear description of the po ssible benefits and risks of drug administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver injury or death. The participant must also provide signed informed consent specifically for the restart. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the stud y chart. Study drug must be administered at the dose specified by the VSLC. Participants approved b y the VSLC for restarting or re -dosing IP must return to the clinic once a week for liver chemistry tests for a minimum of one month and thereafter for as long as clinically indicated and then laboratory monitoring may resume as per protocol. If protocol defined stopping criteria for liver chemistry elevations are met, study drug must be stopped. 5.5.2. QTc Stopping Criteria A participant who has a QTc interval >550 msec considered causall y related to I P will be withdrawn from the study. The QTc should be based on averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms obtained over a brief (e.g., 5 to 10 minute) recording period. If an alternativ e cause of the QT prolongation is determined (e.g., participant receiving drug known to cause prolonged QT or TdP), the IP may be restarted (or continued) after 2019N406358_00"
96,page_96,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 97consultation and agreement with the Medical Monitor. RPV and RPV L A should not be administered to patients who are receiving a drug known to be associated with TdP. When performing ECGs , the sameQT correction formula mustbe used for each individual participant to determine eligibility for,and discontinuation from ,the study. This formula may not be changed or substituted once the participant has been enrolled. For example, if a participant is eligible for the protocol based on QTcB, then QTcB must be used for discontinuation of this individual participant as well. Once the QT correction formula h as been chosen for a participant’s eligibility , the same formulamust continue to be used for that participant for all QTc data being collected for data analysis .Safety ECGs and other non- protocol specified ECGs are an exception. 5.5.3. Virologic Failure Onlyplasma HIV -1 RNA values determined by the central laboratory will be used to assess virologic failure. 5.5.4. Definition of Protocol -Defined Confirmed Virologic Failure For the purposes of clinical management in this study , CVF is defined as: Rebound as indica ted by two consecutive plasma HIV -1 RNA levels 200 c/mL after prior suppression to <200 c/mL . 5.5.5. Managing Virologic Failure Following stud y entry, no changes, or intensification of ART will be permitted prior to protocol-defined virologic failure, outside of the planned protocol regimens. Only plasma HIV -1 RNA values determined by the central laboratory will be used to assess virologic failure. Baseline plasma HIV -1 RNA is the assessment completed on study Day 1. The definition of confirmed virologic failu re does not appl y to participants in the LTFUPhase. These participants will be followed for the emergence of viral resistance. Inadequate adherence is a common cause for virologic failure, and should be explored as a first step in the management of stu dy participants (e.g., at the first indication of inadequate virologic response or rebound). Upon notification that a participant’s HIV -1 RNA plasma level qualifies him/her as a suspected virologic failure, the Investigator should query the participant reg arding intercurrent illness, recent immunization, or interruption of oral therapy . 5.5.5.1. HIV-1 RNA Blips HIV-1 RNA “blips” are not usually associated with subsequent virologic failure [ DHHS, 2016]. Although the implications of persistent HIV- 1 RNA levels between the lower level of detection and <200 c/mL are unclear, the risk of emerging resistance is believed to be relativel y low. 2019N406358_00"
97,page_97,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 98Participants with transient increases in HIV-1 RNA (‘blips’ HIV- 1 RNA <200 c/mL ) are not considered suspected virologic failures and do not require a change in therap y. Participants who have a HIV- 1 RNA ≥50 c/mL and <200 c/mL at the key analysis timepoints (Week 48 and Week 96) must return to the clinic as soon as possible (but no later than 4 w eeks after the date of the Week 48 and 96 visit, respectively ) for a repeat HIV-1 RNA test such that the result falls within the same analy sis window. In order to better characterize HIV -1 RNA ‘blips,’ if there is a known reason / explanation for the blip (e.g., immunization, allergies, etc.), the stud y team should be notified of the reason and case context. If the Investigator has conce rns regarding persistent low level viremia (HIV- 1 RNA ≥50c/mL and <200 c/mL), the Medical Monitor should be contacted to discuss participant management. Following discussion with the Medical Monitor, additional viral load testing may be performed between visits to determine the appropriate participant disposition for the next scheduled visit 5.5.5.2. Suspected Virologic Failure Upon notification that a participant’s HIV -1 RNA plasma level meets the definition of virologic failure, the Investigator should confirm t he definition is met by initiating a repeat of the HIV -1 RNA assessment. The following guidelines should be followed for scheduling confirmatory HIV -1 RNA testing in an effort to avoid false- positive results: Confirmatory testing should be scheduled within 2 to 4 weeks following resolution of any intercurrent illness, during which time the participant should receive full dose of all IP. Confirmatory testing should be scheduled at least 4 weeks following any immunization, during which time the participant sh ould receive full dose of all I P. If therapy is interrupted* due to toxicity management, non -compliance, or other reasons, confirmatory testing should be scheduled 2 to 4 weeks following resumption of full dose of all IP. The participant should have receiv ed full dose of IP for at least 2 weeks at the time confirmatory plasma HIV -1 RNA testing is done. *Note: treatment interruption guidelines above may not apply for participants on CAB LA + RPV LA treatment. The study team should be contacted to discuss any treatment interruptions for participants meeting the definition of virologic failure. In addition, the Investigator should query the participant regarding intercurrent illness, recent immunization, or interruption of therap y. Sites should contact the Me dical Monitor to discuss individual participants, whenever necessary. 2019N406358_00"
98,page_98,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 995.5.5.3. Confirmed Virologic Failure Participants with confirmed virologic failure (CVF) must be discontinued from study treatment . However, participants who have received at least one dose of C AB LA or RPV LA prior to confirming virologic failure will remain in the study on oral HAART in the LTFUPhase. A plasma sample from the suspected virologic failure visit as well as Day 1 (if baseline HIV-1 RNA level  200 c/mL ) will be sent for genoty pic and phenot ypic resistance testing and the result made known to the Investigator when available. A plasma sample from the confirmation visit will be obtained for storage. This sample may be used for possible future anal yses, e.g., for genot ypic and phenoty pic analyses of participants who experience virologic failure. For all participants who meet CVF, baseline and suspected virologic failure plasma samples with HIV -1 RNA level  200 c/mL will be anal yzed in an attempt to obtain genotype/phenotype data on as man y samples as possible. Plasma samples for storage will also be obtained at unscheduled visits including confirmation of CVF. Participants may continue to receive study drug at the discretion of the investigator until results of resistance testing are available at which time the participant must be discontinued from the study. Even if genotype/phenotype data cannot be generated, participant must also be discontinued from the study treatment. If a participant is prematurely discontinued from the study treatment, the investigator must make every effort to perform the Withdrawal Visit evaluations outlined in the Time and Events These data will be recorded as they comprise essential evaluations needed to be done before discharging an y participant from the study . 5.6. Participant and Study Completion The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post - study care of the participant’s medical condition. Study Completion Participants are considered to have completed the study ifthey remain on therap y (i.e., have not permanently discontinued I P) and satisfy one of the following: Randomly assigned to either treatment group, completed the randomized Maintenance Phase including Week 100 (with or without Week 100 study treatment) anddid not enter the Extension Phase; Randomly assigned to either treatment group, completed the randomized Maintenance Phase including Week 100, and entered and completed the Extension Phase (defined as remaining on stud y until commercial supplies of CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W or Q8W regimen become locally available or development of CAB LA + RPV LA is terminated). 2019N406358_00"
99,page_99,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 100Participants who withdraw from CAB LA + RPV LA and go into the LTFUPhase will be considered to have prematurel y withdrawn from the study treatment. In addition to the 52 -week Follow -Up phase required for participants who receive one or more injections with CAB LA orRPV LA, an in- clinic Follow -Up visit will be conducted approximately 4 weeks after the last dose of stud y medication for participants who withdraw during the oral lead -in phasewith ongoing AEs, and serious adverse events (SAEs) and also an y laboratory abnormalities that are considered to be AEs or potentially harmful to the participant, at the last on- study visit. Assessments at the Follow -up visit should reflect an y ongoing complaints (e.g., blood draws to follow a laboratory abnormality ). Follow -Up visits are not required for successful completion of the study . 6. STUDY TREATMENT 6.1. Investigational Product and Other Study Treatment The term ‘s tudy treatment’ is used throughout the protocol to describe any combination of products received b y the participant as per the protocol design. Study treatment is defined as an y investigational treatment(s), marketed product(s), placebo, or medical device (s)intended to be administered to a study participant according to the study protocol . Study treatment may therefore refer to the individual study treatments or the combination of those study treatments. Investigational product (IP) in this protocol refer s to the investigational study drugs Oral Cabotegravir, Cabotegravir L A, Oral Rilpivirine and Rilpivirine L A. These will be supplied by GlaxoSmithKline/ViiV Healthcare and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, respectivel y. Participants entering the Long- Term Follow -Up Phase will not have their selected HAART provided as clinical trial material. The selected HAART will be recorded on the Concomitant Antiretroviral Therap y (ConART) eCRF page. 6.1.1. Formulations of CA B + RPV 6.1.1.1. Cabotegravir Tablets (CA B) CAB is manufactured b yGlaxoSmithKline and is formulated as white to almost white oval shaped film coated 30 mg tablets for oral administration, packaged in high densit y polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with desiccant and child -resistant closure that include an induction seal.

Treatment A ssignment Informed consent must be obtained prior to an y study procedures, including Screening visit activities. Participants will be assigned to study treatment in accordance with the randomization schedule. The randomization sche dule, including stratification, will be generated using the GSK validated randomization software RANDALL NG. The 2019N406358_00"
101,page_101,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 102randomization schedule is comprised of a series of blocks, with equal treatment allocation within each block, which are shared across centers v ia central randomization. Given the open -label study design, central randomization was used to eliminate selection bias due to foreknowledge of randomized treatment. With central randomization, knowledge at a site of the randomized treatment group for pre vious subjects does not predict which treatment group will be assigned to the next randomized subject. Randomization and study treatment assignment will be facilitated b y the interactive response technology (IRT) through the central Randomization and Medication Ordering System Next Generation (RAMOS NG). Following confirmation of fulfillment of study entry criteria, study site personnel will be required to register participants using RAMOS NG for assignment of a unique identifier (designating the particip ant’s randomization code and treatment sequence assignment) for each participant participating in the study . A unique treatment number will be assigned for each participant participating in the stud y. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W or to CAB LA + RPV L A Q8W in accordance with the computer generated randomization schedule. Participants who successfully complete 100 weeks of treatment and have a viral load <50c/ml at Week 96 (or upon retest b y Week 100) will be given the opportunity to enter the Extension Phase in which they will continue to receive their CAB LA + RPV L A regimen. In addition, RAMOS NG will facilitate the initial supply and subsequent resupply of IP to study sites. 6.3. Dosage and A dministration Participant s will be randomly assigned to receive treatment with CAB LA + RPV L A either Q4W or Q8W. Patients transitioning from oral standard of care therapy will initiate their randomized tre atment regimen with Oral CAB 30 mg + RPV 25 mg once daily for 4 to 5 weeks during the Oral Phase, followed by CAB LA + RPV LA IM injections initiating at Week 4b. Patientstransitioning from the ATLAS study and on CAB LA + RPV LA Q4W treatment will be randomized at Day 1 to either continue Q4W administration or transition to Q8 W administration of CAB LA + RPV LA. Regardless of treatment arm assignment, the investigator should instruct all participants on the importance of treatment adherence. This stud y has an open -label design.

Blinding This will be an open -label study and therefore no blinding is required. No summaries of the study data according to act ual randomized treatment groups will be available to sponsor staff prior to the planned Week 24 preliminary analysis. The Week 24 results will be restricted to onl y those study team members and GSK/ViiV Healthcare senior management who need to be involved in the analy sis and interpretation of the results for reporting to regulatory authorities. Public presentation of the Week 24 analy sis will not be done prior to Week 48 anal ysis complete. 6.5. Packaging and Labeling The contents of the label will be in accordan ce with all applicable regulatory requirements. 6.6. Preparation/Handling/Storage/A ccountability The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study treatment received and any discrepanc ies are reported and resolved before use of the stud y treatment. Only participants enrolled in the study may receive study treatment and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study treatment. All study treatments 2019N406358_00"
104,page_104,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 105must be stored in a secure, e nvironmentall y controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. In accordance with local regulatory requirements, the investigator, ins titution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for stud y treatment accountability , reconciliation, and record maintenance (i.e. receipt, reconciliation and final disposition records). The amount of IP dispensed and/or a dministered to study participants, the amount returned b y study participants, and the amount received from and returned to GSK must be documented. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study treatment are provided in the Stud y Reference Manual. Under normal conditions of handling and administration, study treatment is not expected to pose significant safety risks to site staff . Take adequate precautions to avoid direct ey e or skin contact and the generation of aerosols or mi sts. In the case of unintentional occupational exposure notify the monitor, Medical Monitor and/or GSK study contact. A Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS)/equivalent document describing occupational hazards and recommended handling precautions either will b e provided to the investigator, where this is required b y local laws, or is available upon request from GSK. Product accountability records must be maintained throughout the course of the study. IP accountability will be evaluated using pill counts of unused I P for patients receiving oral treatment (oral CAB, oral RPV). This assessment will be conducted, when the participant completes oral CAB and RPV lead -in treatment in the Maintenance or Extension Phase, or any withdrawal that occurs during an oral trea tment phase. IP accountability for participants receiving CAB LA + RPV LA will be performed at the ‘vial’ level (e.g., correct number of vials were used for each injection). There may be a small amount of solution remaining in the vial which does not requ ire quantification. Used vials may be discarded at the site once accountability is complete. 6.6.1. Dosing Considerations for CA B LA + RPV LA Vials of CAB LA and RPV L A are each supplied as a suspension and need no further dilution or reconstitution. Since RPV LA requires refrigeration, sites should allow the vial to come to approximately room temperature prior to injecting. The vials should be gently inverted a few times to re- suspend sediments and allow bubbles to subside, and then use a s yringe to withdraw th e required volume of suspension for IM injection. 2019N406358_00"
105,page_105,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 106All injections must be given intramuscularl y in the gluteus medius. Sites may use their discretion as to where in the gluteus muscle each injection is given according to individual participant circumstan ce. If possible, injections should be spaced approximately 2 cm from one another, from the site of an y previous injection or an y injection site reaction. The time and location of injection will be captured in the eCRF. IM injections should be administe red at a 90 degree angle into the gluteus medius muscle using a needle of appropriate gauge and length ( In most participants, a 1.5” 23 gauge needle for CAB LA and a 1.5” 23 gauge needle for RPV L A is recommended ). The needle should be long enough to reac h the muscle mass and prevent study drug from seeping into subcutaneous tissue, but not so long as to involve underly ing nerves, blood vessels, or bone. Variable needle lengths and/or needles with different gauge (CAB LA: 21 to 25gauge; RPV L A: 21 to 23 gauge) are permitted if needed to accommodate individual body types. Longer needle lengths may be required for participants with higher bod y mass indexes (BMIs, example > 30), to ensure that injections are administered intramuscularly as opposed to subcut aneously. BMI, needle gauge and length used will be collected in the eCRF. Additional details of the injection device used by sites for IM administration including, but not limited to functional performance, may also be collected within the eCRF. At the Week 4b visit, participants transitioning from oral SOC should be dosed with the IM regimen within 2 hours of taking the last ora l regimen dose where possible. Should IM maladministration be suspected at an y time (e.g., suspected under or overdose or inadvertent IV dosing), the investigator may consider requesting the participant stay onsite for approximately 2-3 hours post dose for safet y monitoring and notifying the Medical Monitor. An ECG or an y other supportive testing may be obtained at the discretion of the investigator. Additionally , a PK sample may be drawn approximately 2 hours post dosing for future evaluation of CAB and RPV plasma concentrations. Additional dosing instructions and considerations can be found in the SPM . 6.7. Compliance with Study Treatment A dministration When participants are dosed at the site, they will receive study treatment directl y from the investigator or designee, under medical supervision. The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will be recorded in the part icipant’s eCRF. The dose of study treatment and study participant identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing b y a member of the stud y site staff other than the person administering the stud y treatment. When participants self -administer oral s tudy treatments at home , compliance with CAB + RPV dosing will be assessed through query ing the participant during the site visits and documented in the source documents and CRF. IP accountability will be evaluated using pill counts of unused I P (CAB and RPV tablets). This assessment will be conducted each time the participant receives a new (refill) supply of oral study medication, completes the oral lead- in or any oral bridging phase. A record of the number of CAB and RPV tablets dispensed to and taken by each participant must be maintained and reconciled with study treatment and compliance records. Treatment start and stop dates will also be recorded in the eCRF. 2019N406358_00"
106,page_106,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 107Due to the long acting nature of the CAB LA and RPV L A it will be imperative that the participant is compliant with dosing instructions. As part of the screening and participant selection process, it is imperative that Investigators discuss with potential participants the long-term commitments for the trial, and the importance of adhering to treatment regimens. Sites are to have plans in place for adherence counselling for both treatment arms of the stud y for the duration of the study including the LTFUPhase. In addition, Investigators must have plans in place to perform visit reminders, u tilizing patient trackers provided b y the study team as needed, and to verify the participant’s contact information at each visit. I nvestigators should contact patients directl y in the event that a participant misses an y scheduled visit. 6.8. Protocol Permitted Substitutions 6.8.1. Oral Bridging In exceptional circumstances, to address pre -planned missed CAB LA + RPV L A dosing visits, in consultation with the med ical monitor, Investigators may provide daily oral CAB 30 mg and RPV 25 mg as a short -term “bridging” stra tegy for participants who have begun CAB LA + RPV L A. In certain circumstances (e.g., prior to stead y state dosing and following a >4 week oral bridge) repeating the loading doses of CAB IM and RPV IM may be required. Should a participant require “oral bridging”, sites must contact the study Medical M onitor for guidance with treatment and dosing strategies prior to a missed CAB LA + RPV LA dose. 6.9. Interruption of Study Treatment and Visit/Dosing Windows IP may be interrupted at the discretion of the Investigator in the event of an AE, according to the severit y of the AE. If one or more antiretroviral medications is held due to toxicity or adverse events, all antiretroviral medications must be held to reduce the risk of development of resistance taking into account both the length of the planned interruption and the pharmacokinetic half-life of each antiretroviral of the regimen, in a way to minimize the risk of development of resistance. It is important to note that keeping to the participant’s visit schedul e is a very important component to the study. Note: All decisions regarding dose interruption / resumption must be discussed with the medical monitor in advance. 6.9.1. IM Dosing Participants receiving CAB LA and/or RPV LA are anticipated to be at risk for development of virologic resistance if ART is interrupted. The time period during which participants are at risk for development of virologic resistance may be determined by the period between when drug levels fall below therapeutic values and when they fall below levels which exert selective pressure on HIV. This time period will vary by ART agent and is dependent upon effective concentration, inhibitory concentration, and half -life. 2019N406358_00"

Any interruption in I M dosing should be discussed with the Medical Monitor. Investigators should ensure that the participant initiates alternative highly active ART to minimize the risk of developing resistance as concentrat ions of CAB and RPV decline over time. IM dosing is expected to occur during the week in which the participant’s projected visit falls (as according to the date of the first injection). The first injections for participants from ATLAS on CAB LA + RPV L A Q4W will occur at Day 1. The first injections for participants transitioning from oral SOC are administered at Week 4b (can be performed as soon as lab results from Week 4a become available and should be performed where possible within 2 weeks of visit 4a) , and the second inj ections are given at Week 8. Between the Week 4a and 4b visits, participants must continue daily treatment with oral CAB and RPV tablets. Since the first injection visit (Day 1 or 4b) will determine the future injection visit schedulefor participants, planning for the first injection visit date (within allowed visit windows) should take into consideration the availability of theparticipants to adhere to future visit windows (planned vacations, business trips, etc .). CAB LA + RPV LA d osingfor participants transitioning from SOC treatment is as follows: All injections should be planned as single injections per drug. 6.9.1.1. IM injections every 4 weeks (Q4W): Week 4b only -CAB LA 600 mg + RPV LA 900 mg, each given as 1 X 3 mL IM injection Week8 and Q4W thereafter - CAB LA 400 mg IM + RPV L A 600 mg IM every 4 weeks for 100 weeks, each given as 1 X 2 mL IM injection At Week 4b, participants transitioning from SOC will return to the clinic, take the last dose of oral CAB 30 mg + RPV 25 mg, and receive the first CAB LA 600 mg + RPV LA 900 mg injections (within 2 hours of the final oral dose of CAB + RPV). The first injection visit with I M CAB LA + RPV LA at Week 4b can be performed once central lab results are available and safet y parameters are r eviewed from the Week 4a visit. The second and third IM injections with CAB LA 400 mg and RPV LA 600 mg will be performed at Week 8 and Week 12. There will be a -7 day dosing window for the second and third IM injections such that the second injection o ccurs within the window of Week 7 and Week 8 but no later than Week 8 and the third injection occurs within the window of Week 11 and Week 12 but no later than Week 12. Subsequent injections with CAB LA 400 mg and RPV L A 600 mg will occur every 4 weeks ( 7 days) thereafter. In addition, starting after the Week 16 injection, efforts should be made to limit time between injection visits to a maximum of 5 weeks. The Medical Monitor must be contacted if the length of time between injections exceeds or is pro jected to exceed 5 weeks. 2019N406358_00"

Any request for the visit/dosing to occur outside of the allowed window must be discussed and agreed with the Medical Monitor prior to dosing. In the event of a late dose, a revised dosing schedule for subsequent dosing may be required and will be communica ted to the site staff at the time of approval for continued dosing. Temporary switch to oral dosing of CAB and/or RPV may be an option based on individual participant circumstance as described in Section 6.8. See the SPM for scheduling guidance and further information and examples. Note: All decisions regarding dose interruption/ resumption must be discussed with the Medical Monitor in advance. 6.9.2.

Discontinuation of Study Treatment Participants unable to manage drug toxicity or tolerate investiga tional product (I P, either formulations of CAB or RPV) must have I P discontinued. Any participant receiving at least one dose of CAB LA and /or RPV LA who discontinue I P / Withdraw will initiate treatment with HAART enter the LTFUPhase for 52 weeks of follow up (see Section 4.2.4). 6.11. Treatment of Study Treatment Overdose For participants receiving Oral CAB, an y tablet intake exceeding a total daily dose of 30 mg will be considered an overdose. For participant s receiving oral RPV, any dose exceeding a total daily dose of 25 mg will be considered an overdose. For CAB LA and RPV LA, an y single dose in excess of the studied doses will be considered an overdose. Should IM maladministration, specificall y overdose or inadvertent IV dosing, be suspected at an y time, the participant will stay onsite for approximately 2-3 hours post dose for safet y monitoring and an ECG will be performed at 2 hours post dose. The Medical Monitor will be notified in the event of a suspe cted maladministration. In the event of suspected maladministration, additional PK samples will be drawn at 2hours post dosing for evaluation of CAB and RPV concentrations. For the purposes of this study , an overdose is not an AE (refer to Section 11.6.1) unless it is accompanied b y a clinical manifestation associated with the overdose. If the clinical manifestation presents with serious criteria, the event is a SAE (see Section 11.6.2). If an overdose occurs and is associated with an adverse event requiring action, all study medications must be temporaril y discontinued until the adverse event resolves. The Investigator should use clinical judgement in treating overdose, as ViiV Healthcare is unable to recommend specific treatment. In the event of an overdose the investigator or treating phy sician should: 1.Contact the Medical Monitor immediately 2.Closely monitor the participant for adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs) and laboratory abnormalities until the I P can no longer be detected systemically (at least 5 days for oral CAB and oral RPV, and 52 weeks for CAB LA and RPV L A 3.Obtain a plasma sample for pharmacokinetic (PK) anal ysis if possible within 2 day s from the date of the last dose of study treatment if requested by the Medical Monitor (determined on a case -by-case basis). 4.Document the quantit y of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in the CRF. 2019N406358_00"
111,page_111,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 112Decisions regarding dose interrupti ons or modifications will be made by the investigator in consultation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 6.12. Treatment after the End of the Study The investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has bee n given to the post - study care of the participant’s medical condition, whether or not GSK is providing specific post -study treatment. Participants wh o have successfull y completed 100 weeks of treatment will continue to have access to both CAB LA and RPV L A in the Extension Phase until study treatment is either locally approved and commerciall y available, the participant no longer derives clinical benefit, the participant meets a protocol -defined reason for discontinuation or until development of either CAB LA or RPV LA is terminated. 6.13. Concomitant Medications and Non -Drug Therapies Participants must be advised to notify their Investigator of an y current or proposed concomitant medication, whether prescribed or over- the-counter, because of the potential for interactions between such treatments and the study medications. Concomitant medications (prescription and non -prescription) will be permitted during the course of the study at the investigator’s discretion (except for prohibited medications described in Section 6.13.2) and should be administered onl y as medically necessary during the stud y. All concomitant medication, blood products, and vaccines taken during the study will be recorded in the eCRF. The minimum r equirement is that the drug name, route, and the dates of administration are to be recorded. Any medication or vaccine (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) that the participant is receiving at the tim e of enrollment or receives during the stud y must be recorded along with: reason for use dates of administration including start and end dates dosage information including dose and frequency The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are an y questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy . 6.13.1. Permitted Medications and Non -Drug Therapies Chemoprophy laxis for HIV-associated conditions is encouraged, if appropriate, at the discretion of the participant and their ph ysician. All concomitant medications, b lood products, and vaccines taken during the study will be recorded in the eCRF with dates of administration. Because non- HIV vaccines may cause a temporary increase in the level of plasma HIV -1 RNA, it is recommended that a vaccine, if necessary , be given during or immediately after a scheduled visit after all laboratory tests have been drawn. This approach will 2019N406358_00"
112,page_112,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 113minimize the risk of non- specific increases in the level of plasma HIV -1 RNA at the next scheduled assessment. Other IM injectables (with excepti ons below) are permitted but must be administered away from the site of IP administration (should be spaced 2 cm or more away from site of IP injection). Antacid and H2 Antagonist Use: Since co-administration of oral CAB and RPV is required in this study , the most restrictive dosing requirements must be taken into consideration. CAB oral administration only : Antacid products containing divalent cations (e.g., aluminium, calcium and magnesium) must be taken at least 2 hours before or at least 4 hours after CAB. Concurrent administration of multivitamins is acceptable. RPV oral administration only: Antacid products must be taken at least 2 hours before or at least 4 hours after RPV. H2-Receptor antagonists (e.g. cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine, ranitidine) may cause significant decreases in RPV plasma concentrations. H2-receptor antagonists should only be administered at least 12 hours before or at least 4 hours after RPV. RPV should not be co- administered with proton pump inhibitors, such as esomepraz ole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole. RPV: Administration of clarithrom ycin, erythromycin and telithromy cin is not recommended with RPV due to possible increase in plasma concentration of RPV due to CYP3A enzy me inhibition. Where possible, alternatives such as azithromycin should be considered. Please refer to the local rilpivirine prescribing information for guidance regarding other drugs that are prohibited, should be used with caution, require dose adjustment, or increased clinicalmonitoring if taken with rilpivirine. Drugs with a known risk ofTorsade des Pointes (TdP) should be used with caution when on rilpivirine (see SPM for list of drugs associated with TdP). 6.13.2. Prohibited Medications and Non -Drug Therapies The following concomi tant medications or therapies are not permitted at any time during the study: HIV immunotherapeutic vaccines are not permitted at an y time during the study. Other experimental agents, antiretroviral drugs not otherwise specified in the protocol, cy totoxicchemotherap y, or radiation therap y may not be administered (see Exclusion Criteria #35 -36, Section 5.2). Systemically administered immunomodulators (such as interleukin and interferon agents) are prohibited (a list of examples is provided in the SPM). This includes topical agents with substantial sy stemic exposure and sy stemic effects. Use of topical imiquimod is permitted. 2019N406358_00"

A single dose of sy stemic dexamethasone is permitted (more than a single dose in a treatment course may cause significant decrease in RPV plasma concent ration and is prohibited). Topical, inhaled or intranasal use of glucocorti coids will be allowed. Hepatitis C infection therapy is prohibited during the Maintenance Phase before the Week 48 primary endpoint, and interferon -based HCV therap y or use of anydrugs that have a potential for adverse drug:drug interactions with study treatment is prohibited throughout the entire study . For information on concurrent therapies and interactions suspected to be relevant to other antiretroviral therap y in the regime n, please consult the local prescribing information. 6.13.2.1. Concurrent with CA B and/or RPV For participants receiving either formulation of CAB and/or RPV, the following medications could significantly decrease the levels of CAB and/or RPV due to enzy me induction and therefore must not be administered concurrently : Carbamazepine Oxcarbazepine Phenobarbital Phenytoin Rifabutin Rifampicin / Rifampin Rifapentine St. John’s wort ( Hypericum perforatum ) Concurrent with CAB CAB is a potent inhibitor of OAT1 and OAT3 tr ansport in vitro, however, no clinically significant interaction risk is expected for most drugs that are substrates of these transporters. Monitoring may be required for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index and dependent on OAT1 and OAT3 transport (e.g. methotrexate) with concomitant CAB administration. Refer to the current I nvestigator’s Brochure ( Section4.3.6.1 and Section 6.4) for additional information. Concurrent with RPV In addition, participants must discontinue the following (or change to an a llowable alternative) while receiving treatment with oral RPV: proton pump inhibitors, such as esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole; 2019N406358_00"

Concurrent with either CA B LA or RPV LA In addition, for participants receiving CAB LA and RPV L A, use of anticoagulation agentsfor greater than 14 day s is prohibited, with the exception of the use of anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis (DVT)prophylaxis (e.g., postoperative DVT prophylaxis) or the use of low dose acet ylsalicylic acid (≤325mg). Systemic anticoagulation (including proph ylaxis doses) on the day of an IM injection should be avoided. Note: Any prohibited medications that decrease cabotegravir or rilpivirine concentrations should be discontinued for a minimum of four weeks or a minimum of three half -lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose and any other prohibited medications should be discontinued for a minimum of two weeks or a minimum of three half -lives (whichever is longer) prior to the first dose. 6.13.2.3. Prohibited Medications for Participants Receiving HAART during the Long-Term Follo w-Up Phase For participants taking HA ARTduring the Long- Term Follow -Up Phase , refer to local prescribing information for details regarding concurrent therapies. 7. STUDY A SSESSMENTS A ND PROCEDURES Protocol waivers or exemption s are not allowed with the exception of immediate safety concerns. Therefore, adherence to the stud y design requirements, including those specified in the Time and Events Table, are essential and required for stud y conduct. This section lists the procedure s and parameters of each planned study assessment. The exact timing of each assessment is listed in the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1). The following points must be noted: If assessments are scheduled for the same nominal time, THEN the assessments should occur in the following order: 1. 12-lead ECG 2.vital signs 3.blood draws Note: The timing of the assessments should allow the blood draw to occur at the exact nominal time. The timing and number of planned stu dy assessments, including safet y, pharmacokinetic, pharmacody namic/biomarker assessments may be altered during the course of the study based on newl y available data (e.g., to obtain data 2019N406358_00"

Background information to be collected at Screening includes demograph y and prior ART history . Eligible participants may be randoml y assigned immediately as soon as all Screening assessments are complete and the results are available and documented. All participants will complete the screening period of approximately 14 days prior to Baseline (Day 1) during which all clinical and laboratory assessments of eligibility must be performed and reviewed. The Screening period may be extended to 35 day s to accommodate availability of all Screening assessment results, completion of source document verification to satisfy the Inclusion and Exclusion C riteria, and scheduling. All Screening results mustbe available prior to randomization. All information about the participant’s current regimen must be available for review by the Principal Investigator or designee prior to randomization. Source documen ts from other medical facilities must be located/received during the 14 day (up to 35 days) screening period and under no circumstances may the participant be randomized in the absence of source documentation even if there are delays in receipt of this inf ormation. Any available prior genoty pic resistance testing must be provided to GSK, after screening and before randomization according to guidance in the SPM, to provide direct evidence of no pre-existing exclusionary resistance mutations. The lack of excl usionary resistance mutations must be confirmed by the study virologist, which will be provided before the screening window closes.

All participants will be screened for syphilis.Participants with untreated sy philis infection, defined as a positive RPR without clear documentation of treatment, are excluded. Participants with a serofast RPR result despite history of adequate therapy and no evidence of re -exposure may enrolafter consultation with the Medical Monitor. Participants with a positive RPR test who have not been treated may be rescreened at least 30 day s after complet ion of antibiotic treatment for s yphilis. The eCSSRS (see Section 7.4.6) assessed at the Screening visit will assess the participant’s lifetime risk (an y suicidal ideation, behavior, etc.occurring over the participant’s lifetime). A positive alert (indicating some risk) is not necessarily exclusionary , rather a means to assess overall risk. Participants who meet all entry criteria are randomized and assigned a randomization number. A single repeat of a procedur e/lab parameter is allowed to determine eligibility (unless otherwise specified). Participants not meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria at initial screen may be rescreened and receive a new participant number one time unless they were excluded for reason of having exclusionary historic genot ypic resistance. Participants who are randomized into the trial and subsequently withdrawn from the study for any reason may not be rescreened. 7.2.2. Baseline A ssessments At Day 1 and prior to randomization, any changes to the eligibility parameters must be assessed and an y results required prior to randomization (e.g., Day 1 urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential) must be available and reviewed.

Adverse Events (A E) and Serious A dverse Events (S AEs) The investigator and their designees are responsible fo r detecting, documenting and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE. 7.4.3.1. Time period and Frequency for collecting A E and SA E information Any SAEs assessed as related to study participation (e.g., protocol- mandated procedures, invasive tests , or change in existing therap y) or related to a GSK product will be recorded from the time a participant consents to participate in the study up to and including an y follow-up contact. All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. AEs will be collected from the start of Study Treatment until the final follow - up contac t, at the timepoints specified in the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1). Medical occurrences that begin prior to the start of study treatment but after obtaining informed consent may be recorded on the Medical History/Current Medical Conditions section of the eCRF. The method of recording, evaluating and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs plus procedures for completing and transmitting SAE r eports to GSK are provided in Section 11.6, Appendix 6 Investigators are not obligated to activel y seek AEs or SAEs in former study participants. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participa nt has been discharged from the study , and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the study treatment or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify GSK. 2019N406358_00"
139,page_139,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 1407.4.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SA Es Care will be taken not to introduce bias whe n detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrence. Appropriate questions include: “How are you feeling?” “Have you had an y (other) medical problems since y our last visit/contact?” “Have you taken an y new medicines, other than those provided in this study , since your last visit/contact?” 7.4.3.3. Follow-up of AEs and SA Es After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactivel y follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non- serious AEs of special interest (as defined in Section 7.4.5) will be followed until resolution, until the condition stabilizes, until the event is otherwise explained, or until the participant is lost to follow - up (as defined in Section 5.5). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Section 11.6, Appendix 6). 7.4.3.4. Prompt Reporting of Serious A dverse Events and Other Events SAEs, pregnancies, and liver function abnormalities meeting pre- defined criteria will be reported promptl y by the investigator to the medical monitor as described in Table 9once the investigator determines that the event meets the protocol definition for that event. Any seizure or suspected seizure should be reported in an expedited manner, as noted in Table 9. Criteria for liver chemistry stopping and follow -up criteria are in Section 5.5.1. 2019N406358_00"

The method of recording, evaluating, and follow -up of AEs and SAEs plus procedures for completing and tran smitting SAE reports to the medical monitor are provided in the SPM. Procedures for post study AEs/SAEs are provided in the SPM. Primary and secondary Medical Monitor/SAE contact information is provided on the Medical Monitor/Sponsor I nformation Page of the current protocol. 7.4.3.5. Disease- Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as SA Es Disease related events (DREs) or outcomes listed in the CDC Classification Sy stem for HIV-1 Infections ( Appendix 4) can be serious/life threatening and will be recorded on the HIV-Associated Conditions eCRF page if they occur. However, these individual events or outcomes, as well as any sign, s ymptom, diagnosis, illness, and/or clinical laboratory abnormality that canbe linked to any of these events or outcomes are not reported to GSK as AEs and SAEs even though such event or outcome may meet the definition of an AE or SAE. However, if either of the following conditions applies, then the event must be recorded and re ported as an SAE (instead of a DRE): The investigator determines that the event or outcome qualifies as an SAE under part ‘other situations’ of the SAE definition (see Section 11.6.2), or The event is, in the investigator’s opinion, of greater intensity , frequency , or duration than expected for the individual participant, or 2019N406358_00"

If any of the above conditions is met then record the DRE on the SAE page rather than the HIV Associated Conditions eCRF page and report promptly (i.e., expedited reporting, see Section 7.4.3.4) to GSK. 7.4.3.6. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SA Es Prompt notification by the investigator to GSK of SAEs related to study treatment (even for non-interventional post -marketing studies) is essential so that legal obligations and ethical res ponsibilities towards the safet y of participants and the safet y of a product under clinical investigation are met. The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safet y of a pro duct under clinical investigation. GSK will comply with country specific regulatory requirements relating to safet y reporting to the regulatory authority , Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (I EC) and investigators. Investigator safety reports are prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions according to local regulatory requirements and GSK policy and are forwarded to investigators as necessary . An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE(s) or other specific safet y information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from GSK will file it with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 7.4.3.7. Cardiovascular and Death Events Investigators will be required t o fill out the specific CV event page of the eCRF for the following AEs and SAEs: Myocardial infarction/unstable angina Congestive heart failure Arrhythmias Valvulopathy Pulmonary hypertension Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack Peripheral arterial thromboembolism Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism Revascularisation 2019N406358_00"
143,page_143,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 144This information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular eCRF within one week of when the AE/SAE(s) are first reported. The CV CRFs are presented as q ueries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms. For any cardiovascular events detailed above, whether or not they are considered SAEs, and all deaths, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the eCRF will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non- cardiovascular death. The CV CRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA terms.The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of the eCRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its completion. 7.4.3.8. Death Events The Death CRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is reported. Initial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within one week of when the death is reported. In addition, all deaths will require a specific death data collection tool to be completed. The death data collection tool includes questions regarding cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and noncardiovascular death. 7.4.4. Toxicity Management Adverse events that occur during the trial should be evaluated b y the Investigator and graded according to the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) toxicity scales (See Section 11.2. “Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severit y of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events”). Additional information regarding detecting, documenting and reporting AEs and SAEs are available in Section 7.4.3and Section 11.6. 7.4.4.1. Treatment Interruption Due to an A dverse Event IP may be interrupted at the discretion of the investigator and according to the severit y of the AE. If one or more ART medication is held due to toxicity or AEs, all ART medications should be held to reduce the risk of development of resistance taking into account the length of the planned interruptions and the PK half- life of each ART of the regimen, in order to minimize the risk of development of resistance. No toxicity -related dose reductions of IP will be allowed. IP should be restarted as soon as medicall y appropriate; in general, for oral dosing, this should be no longer than 14 days after discontinuation ( unless Grade 3 or 4 toxicities persist). Any interruption in therapy during the Maintenance Phase, oral dosing, of greater than 7 consecutive day s must be discussed with and agreed b y the Medical Monitor prior to resumption of therapy. The Medical Monito r must be contacted upon becoming aware of resumption in therapy, if therap y was resumed without prior approval (Section 6.9). IM dosing is expected to occur during the week in which the participant’s projected visit falls (as according to the first injection visit ). An additional (+ or -) 7 day window, from the 2019N406358_00"
144,page_144,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 145projected visit date, is allowable for IM dosing but not preferred. Any interruption outside of this guidance MUST be discussed with the Medical Monit or prior to reinitiating IM IP (see Section 6.9.1). Guidance is provided below on general participant management and IP interruptions based on the severity of the AE. Information regarding permitted substitutio ns \is provided in Section 6.8. All changes in the IP regimen must be accuratel y recorded in the participant’s eCRF. Note: For participants receiving an ABC -containing product as part of the background regimenduring the Long- Term Follow -Up (LTFU)Phase, in the event of a discontinuation of ABC for any reason, re -initiation of this drug should be undertaken with caution. The investigator should obtain a complete history of the events surrounding the discontinua tion of the ABC -containing product, evaluate for the possibility of a clinically suspected HSR, and initiate participant management as outlined in the L ocal Country Prescribing Information, regardless of a participant’s HLA-B*5701status. Screening for the presence of HLA-B*5701 is recommended prior to reinitiating treatment with ABC -containing products in participants of unknown HLA-B*5701status who have previously tolerated ABC but is not required to confirm study eligibility . 7.4.4.2. Grade 1 or Grade 2 Toxicity /Adverse Event Participants who develop a Grade 1 or Grade 2 AE or toxicity may continue study drug at the discretion of the investigator. Participants who choose to withdraw from the study due to a Grade 1 or 2 AE should have study withdrawal and follow -up evaluations completed. Participants who develop ALT ≥3 times ULN while on study must consult with Medical Monitor prior to initiation or continuation of CAB LA + RPV LA 7.4.4.3. Grade 3 Toxicity /Adverse Event Participants who develop a Grade 3 AE or toxicity should be managed as follows: If the Investigator has compelling evidence that the Grade 3 AE or toxicity has not been caused b y IP, dosing may continue after discussion with the Medical Monitor. Participants who develop a Grade 3 AE or toxicity, which the Investigator considers relat ed or possibly related to the IP, should have the IP withheld and be rechecked each week until the AE returns to Grade 2. Once the AE is Grade 2, IP may be re-started. Should the same Grade 3 AE recur within 28 day s in the same participant, the I P should be permanentl y discontinued and the participant withdrawn from study . Participants experiencing Grade 3 AEs requiring permanent discontinuation of IP should be followed weekly until resolution of the AE and to have withdrawal study evaluations completed . A follow -up visit should be performed 4 weeks after the last dose of IP. Any participant receiving at least one dose of CAB L A and /or RPV L A who discontinue I P / Withdraw will initiate treatment with HAART and enter the LTFUPhase for 52 weeks of foll ow up. 2019N406358_00"

Isolated Grade 3 lipid abnormalities do not require withdrawal of I P. 7.4.4.4. Grade 4 Toxicity /Adverse Ev ent Participants who develop a Grade 4 AE or toxicity must have I P permanently discontinued. However, if the Investigator has compelling evidence that the AE is not causally related to the I P, dosing may continue after discussion with, and assent from, th e Medical Monitor. Participants should be rechecked each week until the AE returns to Grade 2. Participants experiencing Grade 4 AEs requiring permanent discontinuation of IP should be followed weekly until resolution of the AE and encouraged to complete the withdrawal and follow -up study evaluations as noted above. Any participant receiving at least one dose of CAB LA and /or RPV L A who discontinue I P / Withdraw will initiate treatment with HAART and enter the LTFUPhase for 52 weeks of follow up. Participants with Grade 4 asy mptomatic laboratory abnormalities should be investigated for all potential non -drug related causes, and, following discussion with the Medical Monitor, may continue therapy if the Investigator has compelling evidence that the toxic ity is not related to I P, with the exception of liver chemistry stopping criteria (See Section 7.4.5.1). An in-clinic follow -up visit will be performed approximately 4 weeks after the last dose of study medication if AEs, SAEs, or laboratory abnormalities considered potentially harmful to the participant are ongoing at the last on- study visit. Isolated Grade 4 lipid abnormalities do not require withdrawal of IP. 7.4.5. Specific Toxicities/Adverse Event Management General guidelines for the management of specific toxicities that are considered to be associated with treatment of HIV patients. Participants who permanently discontinue study drug for reasons of toxicity should be followed weekly until resolution of the AE and encouraged to complete the withdrawal and Follow -up study evaluations as noted in Section 7.4.3.3. 7.4.5.1. Liver Chemistry Stopping and Follo w-up Criteria Liver chemistry threshold stopping criteria have been design ed to assure participant safety and to evaluate liver event etiology during administration of study drug and the follow-up phase. All Phase 3 participants who meet liver stopping criteria will be adjudicated b y the ViiV Safety and Labelling Committee (VSLC ) –resulting in a case summary, adjudication, and management plan. The VSLC contains an external expert hepatologist, familiar with both DILI and cabotegravir, who will participate in this review. This committee meets on a 3 -weekly basis, and can be con vened on an ad hoc basis as needed. 2019N406358_00"
146,page_146,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 1477.4.5.2. Diarrhea Participants with Grade 1 or 2 diarrhea may continue study treatment without interruption. Participants with diarrhea of an y toxicity grade may be treated symptomaticall y with anti -motility agents; however, th e recommended dail y dose of the chosen anti -motility agent must not be exceeded. If s ymptoms persist or get worse on the recommended daily dose of the chosen anti -motility agent then the anti -motility agent must be discontinued and consultation made with the Medical Monitor. For participants with Grade 3 diarrhea that is unresponsive to the recommended dose of the anti-motility agents and for which an alternative etiology (e.g., infectious diarrhea) is not established, the treatment with the anti- motilityagent and IP must be interrupted until resolution of diarrhea to Grade 2 or Baseline, after which IP and background ART may be resumed after discussion and agreement with the Medical Monitor. If Grade 3 diarrhea recurs within 28 day s upon the resumptio n of IP, the IP should be permanentl y discontinued and the participant withdrawn from the study . Any participant receiving at least one dose of CAB LA and /or RPV LA who discontinue I P / Withdraw will initiate treatment with HAART and enter the LTFUPhasefor 52 weeks of follow up. If loperamide is used for treatment of diarrhea, local prescribing information should be followed with respect to dose and frequency of administration. L operamide dosing should not exceed local prescribing information. 7.4.5.3. Hypertriglyceridemia/ Hy percholesterolemia Samples for lipid measurements mustbe obtained in a fasted state according to the Time and Events table (Section 7.1). Participants who experience as ymptomatic trigl yceride or cholesterol elevations may continue to receive IP. Clinical management of participants with hypertriglyceridemia/hy percholesterolemia should not be based upon non- fasting samples (obtained in the fed state). A confirmatory fasting trigl yceride and/or c holesterol level should be obtained prior to the institution of medical therap y for hyperlipidemia. Isolated Grade 3 and Grade 4 lipid abnormalities do not require withdrawal of I P. Please see the Recommendations of the Adult AIDS Clinical Trial Group Car diovascular Disease Focus Group [ Dube, 2003] for full discussion of management of hyperlipidemia in the context of HI V therapy . 7.4.5.4. Seizures Three cases of seizures have occurred in the CAB program cumulativel y through 01 October 2015. ViiV Healthcare has reviewed these cases in detail and does not believe they constitute a reasonable likelihood of causation associated with CAB. This assessment is supported by the lack of preclinical signal, class effect or known CNS mech anism, the relatively low frequency of seizures relative to expected rates in both healthy and HIV positive participants and clinical confounders in each case. The Sponsor considers the risk of developing seizures on the study as being no higher than that of the rest of the HIV -1 infected population. 2019N406358_00"
147,page_147,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 148Seizures that occur on study should be managed according to the local guidelines on emergency seizure management which may include treatment with benzodiazepines, general supportive treatment, exclusion of metabolic and toxicological abnormalities using laboratory tests, septic workup and excluding underly ing structural abnormalities with neuroimaging. Where seizures occur, the Sponsor would like to better characterize these occurrences to enable systematic analyses. Investigators are requested to document and report seizure or possible seizure events promptly (within 24 hours of learning of the event) to the Sponsor for evaluation and onward reporting. Data should be documented on the appropriate eCRF seizur e page. 7.4.5.5. Creatine Phosphokinase (CPK) Elevation A Grade 3 or higher elevation in CPK should result in a repeat assessment within 2 -4 weeks to ensure the result is transient or due to exercise and will not require a change in study treatment. A history regarding use of drugs known to cause increase of CPK (such as statins) phy sical activity or exercise preceding the CPK evaluation should be obtained. Grade 4 elevations in CPK should have a repeat assessment after the participant has abstained from exercise for >24 hours. For persistent Grade 4 CPK elevations that are considered possibl y or probably related to the IP, IP should be discontinued and the participant withdrawn from the study . Any participant receiving at least one dose of CAB LA and /or RPV LA who discontinue I P / Withdraw will initiate treatment with HAART enter the LTFUPhase for 52 weeks of follow-up. 7.4.5.6. Lipase Elevations and Pancreatitis Participants with asy mptomatic Grade 1 or 2 elevations in lipase may be followed closely for the development of symptoms. Participants with asy mptomatic Grade ≥3 elevations in lipase that are considered possibl y or probabl y related to IP should have I P interrupted until serum lipase returns to Grade 2. The lipase assay should be repeated within 2 weeks of any Grade ≥3 result. Participants with persistence of Grade ≥3 lipase in the absence of other diagnoses or reoccurrence of lipase elevation (at Grade ≥2) following reintroduction of IP should permanentl y discontinue IP. Participants with a confirmed diagnosis of clinical p ancreatitis that is considered possibl y or probabl y related to IP should have I P held. After complete resolution of the episode, participants may be re-challenged with I P after discussion with the Medical Monitor, only if the Investigator has compelling e vidence that the event was not caused by IP. Upon re-challenge, lipase determinations should be performed every 2 weeks for at least 6 weeks after re -initiation of treatment. With any elevation of lipase of Grade ≥2 or any recurrence of s ymptoms, the participant should discontinue I P and be withdrawn from study. 2019N406358_00"
148,page_148,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 149Any participant receiving at least one dose of CAB L A and /or RPV LA who discontinue IP / Withdraw will initiate t reatment with HAART and enter the LTFUPhase for 52 weeks of follow up. Drug Restart Following Transient Resolving Liver Events Not Related to Study Drug Approval b y VSLC for drug restart can be considered where: Liver chemistries have a clear underl ying cause (e.g., biliary obstruction, hy potension, and liver chemistries have improved to normal or are within 1.5× baseline and ALT<3×ULN). Ethics Committee or I RB approval of drug restart must be obtained, as required. If restart of drug is approved by VSLC in writing, the participant must be provided with a clear description of the possible benefits and risks of drug administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more severe liver injury or death. The participant must also provide signed informed consent specifically for the restart. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the study chart. Study drug must be administered at the dose specified by VSLC. Participants approved b y VSLC for restarting study drug must return to the clinic once a week for liver chemistry tests for a minimum of one month and thereafter for as long as clinically indicated and then laboratory monitoring may resume as per protocol. If protocol defined stopping criteria for liver chemistry elevations are met, stu dy drug must be stopped. Refer toSection11.2, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National I nstitute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Division of AIDS.

Decline in Renal Function Participants who experience an increase in seru m creatinine from Baseline of 45 micromoles/liter ( Mol/L) (or 0.5milligrams/deciliter [mg/dL ]) should return for a confirmatory assessment within 2 to 4 weeks. A urinaly sis and urine albumin/creatinine and urine total protein/albumin ratios should also be done at this confirmatory visit. If the creatinine increase is confirmed, the investigator should contact the study medical monitor to discuss additional follow-up and medical management. Participants who have a decline in the estimated GFR (using the CKD-EPI method) of >50% from Baseline must return for a confirmatory assessment as soon as possible [Levey, 2009]. A urinal ysis and urine albumin/creatinine and urine protein/creatinine 2019N406358_00"
149,page_149,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 150ratios should also be done at th is confirmatory visit. If the estimated GFR has declined b y >50% (confirmed), then study drug should be withheld and the investigator should contact the stud y medical monitor to discuss the rationale for restarting study drugs (if appropriate). Considerat ion for confounding factors (e.g., background therap y, other medications, deh ydration, concurrent conditions) should be taken into account, and a nephrology consult may be obtained. 7.4.5.7.1. Proximal Renal Tubule Dysfunctions (PRTD) PRTD is defined as: Confirmed rise in serum creatinine of ≥0.5 mg/dL from Baseline AND serum phosphate <2.0 mg/dL; Either of the above accompanied by any two of the following: Glycosuria (≥250 mg/dL) in a non -diabetic; Low serum potassium (<3 mEq/L ); Low serum bicarbonate (<19 mEq/L ). Participants meeting criteria for PRTD must return for a confirmatory assessment within 2 weeks of diagnosis. A urinaly sis should also be performed at the time of the confirmatory assessment. If PRTD is confirmed participants should have study drug withheld and the investigator should contact the Study medical monitor to discuss the rationale for restarting study drugs (if appropriate). Consideration for confounding factors (e.g., NRTI backbone, other medications, deh ydration, concurrent conditions) should be taken into account, and a nephrology consult may be obtained. If study drug is reinitiated, it should have been withheld for no more than 4 weeks. 7.4.5.8. Proteinuria Participants with an abnormal urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio (>0.3 mg/mg, >300mg/g, or>34mg/mmol) that represents a change from Baseline and no associated increase in creatinine, should have a repeat spot urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio performed within 2-4 weeks. If confirmed, then consideration should be given to additional evaluation after consultation with the study medical monitor. Additional evaluation may include a 24- hour urine protein and creatinine measurement and nephrology referral. Participants with an abnormal urine albumin/creatinine ratio (>0.3 mg/mg, 300 mg/g, or >34mg/mmol and representing a change from Baseline) and a serum creatinine increase >45μmol/L (or 0.5mg/dL) should have confirmation of both results within 2 weeks. If confirmed, the stud y medical monitor should be contacted immediatel y. Agreement on furthermanagement should be agreed between the investigator and medical monitor. 2019N406358_00"

QTc Prolongation Participants with an average QTc interval >550 msec from three or more tracings separated b y at least 5 minutes should have IP discontinued. These criteria are ba sed on an average QTc value of triplicate ECGs. If an ECG demonstrates a prolonged QT interval, obtain 2 more ECGs over a brief period (~5 -10minutes) and use the averaged QTc values of the 3 ECGs to determine whether the participant should be discontinue d from the study . If an alternative cause of the QT prolongation is determined (e.g., participant receiving drug known to cause prolonged QT or TdP), then IP may be restarted after consultation with, and agreement b y, the Medical Monitor. 7.4.5.10. Injection Site Reactions (ISRs) Injection site reactions will be managed through investigator assessment throughout the study. All ISRs that are either serious, Grade 3 or higher, or persisting beyond 2 weeks must be discussed with the Medical Monitor to determine etiol ogy and assess appropriate continued study participation. Digital photographs may be documented where possible on all participants who have an injection site reaction, with observable findings, that is either serious or Grade 3 or higher, or that persist s beyond 2 weeks. Dermatology will be consulted on all participants who have an injection site reaction considered serious, Grade 3 or above, or if clinically significant and persistent bey ond 30days and others if the Investigator or Medical Monitor feel s it is medically necessary . Details regarding photo collection and an y other follow up will be given by the Medical Monitor at the time of assessment. ISR discomfort can be managed s ymptomaticall y (e.g., cold/warm compress, acetaminophen, ibuprofen) if th e reaction is interfering with the participant’s ability to perform activities of daily living. The required intervention should be documented on the appropriate eCRF page. 7.4.5.11. Allergic reaction Participants may continue study drug for Grade 1 or 2 allergic reactions at the discretion of the Investigator. The participant should be advised to contact the Investigator immediately if there is any worsening of s ymptoms or if further s ystemic signs or symptoms develop. Antihistamines, topical corticosteroids, or a ntipruritic agents may be prescribed. Participants with Grade ≥3 allergic reactions that are considered to be possibly or probably related to the study drug should permanently discontinue the CAB LA+ RPV LA regimen and the participant should be withdrawn from the study . Participants should be treated as clinicall y appropriate and followed until resolution of the AE. 7.4.5.12. Abacavir Hy persensitivity Reaction (A BC HSR) The most significant toxicity associated with ABC is the well -characterized drug -related hypersensitivity reaction (HSR). A detailed clinical description of this reaction 2019N406358_00"
151,page_151,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 152(including the t ype and severit y of events that can occur on re -challenge or reintroduction following ABC interruption for non- HSR reasons) and guidance regarding its management are included in the L ocal Country Prescribing Information for EPZICOM. Investigators must familiarize themselves with this information on ABC HSR in the Local Country Prescribing Information for each of these products prior to initiating participants on ABC therapy . Studies have shown that carr iage of the HLA-B*5701allele is associated with a significantl y increased risk of a HSR to ABC. In the prospective stud y CNA106030 (PREDICT-1), the use of pre -therapy screening for the presence of HLA-B*5701and subsequently avoiding ABC in HLA -B*5701positive patients, significantly reduced the incidence of clinicall y suspected ABC HSR from 7.8% (66 of 847) to 3.4% (27 of 803) (p<0.0001). In clinical studies EPZ108859 (ARIES) and CNA109586 (ASSERT), 0.8% (4/515) and 3.1% (6/192) of participants who were HLA-B*5701negative and who received ABC developed a clinically suspected ABC HSR, respectivel y. In any participant treated with ABC, the clinical diagnosis of suspected HSR (as detailed in the Local Country Prescribing Information) must remain the basis of clinical decision making. Regardless of HLA-B*5701status, it is important to permanently discontinue ABC and not re-challenge with ABC (i.e., ZIAGEN, EPZICOM/KIVEXA, TRIZIVIR, or TRIUMEQ) if a HSR cannot be ruled out on clinical grounds, due to the po tential for a severe or even fatal reaction. 7.4.5.12.1. Essential Patient Information With reference to Local Country Prescribing Information and the ‘Participant I nformation and Consent Form’, Investigators must ensure that participants are full y informed regarding the following information on the hy persensitivity reaction prior to commencing ABC therap y: Participants must be made aware of the possibility of a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir that may result in a life -threatening reaction or death and that the r isk of a hypersensitivity reaction is increased in individuals who are HLA-B*5701 positive. Participants must also be informed that HLA-B*5701negative individuals can also experience abacavir hy persensitivity reaction. Therefore, ANY participant who deve lops signs or s ymptoms consistent with a possible hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir MUST CONTACT their doctor IMMEDIATELY. Participants who are h ypersensitive to abacavir should be reminded that they must never take an y abacavir containing medicinal pr oducts (e.g., ZIAGEN, EPZICOM, KIVEXA, TRIZIVIR, or TRIUMEQ) again, regardless of their HLA- B*5701status. In order to avoid restarting abacavir, participants who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction should be asked to return any remaining EPZICOM / KIVEXA tablets to the Investigator or site staff. 2019N406358_00"
152,page_152,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 153Participants, who have stopped abacavir for an y reason, and particularl y due to possible adverse reactions or illness, must be advised to contact their doctor before restarting EPZICOM / KIVEXA as more se vere symptoms may recur within hours and may include life -threatening hy potension and death. Each participant should be reminded to read the Package Leaflet included in the EPZICOM / KIVEXA pack. They should be reminded of the importance of removing the A lert Card included in the pack, and keeping it with them at all times. 7.4.5.12.2. Reporting of Hypersensitivity Reactions If a clinically suspected case of HSR to ABC meets one of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH E2A, 1994 definitions of seriousness listed in Section 11.6.2 then, in addition to reporting the case as an SAE, the ABC HSR eCRF should also be completed within one week of the onset of the h ypersensitivity reaction. Clinically suspected cases of HSR to ABC that do not meet criteria as an SAE can be recorded as an AE. 7.4.5.13. Rash Without A BC HSR Sy mptoms Including serious skin reactions such as Stevens- Johnson Syndrome, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, Erythema Multifo rme or rash with significant liver dysfunction. Participants should be instructed to contact the Investigator as soon as possible if they develop a rash on study . Participants who develop rash of an y grade should be evaluated for the possibility of an ABCHSR or a serious skin reaction such as Stevens -Johnson sy ndrome (SJS), Toxic Epidermal Necrol ysis (TEN) or Ery thema Multiforme. SJS, TEN, and Ery thema Multiforme have been reported very rarely in patients taking ABC -containing products. These patients generally do not have the cluster of additional sy mptoms (e.g., gastrointestinal and respiratory ) that characterize the ABC HSR, but they do have features ty pical of these serious skin reactions. If a serious skin reaction develops, ABC (and / or all othe r concurrent medication(s) suspected in the Investigators causalit y assessment) should be discontinued, and the participant should not be re- challenged with an y ABC-containing medicinal product (i.e., ZIAGEN, TRIZIVIR, EPZICOM, or KIVEXA). As many products other than abacavir also cause rash and/or serious skin reactions, all other medicinal products that the participant is receiving should also be reviewed and discontinued as appropriate. The following guidance is provided for clinical management of partic ipants who experience rash alone in the absence of accompany ing diagnosis of ABC HSR, sy stemic or allergic s ymptoms or signs of mucosal or target lesions. CAB is an analogue of DTG and mild to moderate rash is an expected adverse reaction for DTG-containing ART. Episodes generally occur within the first ten weeks of 2019N406358_00"
153,page_153,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 154treatment, rarel y require interruptions or discontinuations of therap y and tend to resolve within two to three weeks. No instances of serious skin reaction, including Stevens-Johnson sy ndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrol ysis (TEN) and ery thema multiforme, have been reported for DTG in clinical trials. For further characterization of HSR and rash observed with DTG -containing ART, please see the current version of the IB [GlaxoSmithKline Docume nt Number RH2009/00003/06]. Rash is an adverse drug reaction (ADR) for RPV. I n clinical trials, most rashes emerged during the first 4 weeks of treatment, were transient, and usually mild (Grade 1) to moderate (Gr ade 2). There were no Grade 4 rashes and none were serious. Treatment- related Grade 3 rash was reported in 0.1% of participants in the RPV group. Treatment - related rash led to permanent discontinuation in 0.1% of participants in the RPV group. No cases of erythema multiforme, SJS or TEN have been reported during clinical development of RPV. Participants with an isolated Grade 1 rash may continue study drug at the Investigator’s discretion. The participant should be advised to contact the Investigator i mmediately if there is an y worsening of the rash, if an y systemic signs or s ymptoms appear, or if mucosal involvement develops. Participants may continue study drug for an isolated Grade 2 rash. However, study drug (and all other concurrent medication(s) suspected in the I nvestigators c ausality assessment) should be permanently discontinued for any Grade ≥2 rash that is associated with an increase in ALT. The participant should be advised to contact the phy sician immediately if rash fails to resolve (after more than two weeks), if there is any worsening of the rash, if an y systemic signs or allergic s ymptoms develop, or if mucosal involvement develops. Participants should permanently discontinue study drug [and all other concurrent medication(s) suspected in the I nvestigators causality assessment] for an isolated Grade 3 or 4 rash, except where the etiology of the rash has been definitivel y diagnosed as NOT attributable to study drug (see below), and the participant should be withdrawn from the study. Participants should be treated as cl inically appropriate and followed until resolution of the AE. Every effort should be made to collect as much information as possible about the evolution of the event and an y relationship with potentially related medical events (e.g., viral infection) or s tart of concomitant medication. The rash and an y associated sy mptoms should be reported as adverse events and appropriate toxicity ratings should be used to grade the events (based on DAIDS toxicity gradings –see Section 11.2, Appendix 2). However, if the etiology of the rash has been definitively diagnosed as being unrelated to study drug and due to a specific medical event or a concomitant infection or a concomitant no n-study medication, routine management should be performed and documentation of the diagnosis provided. In this situation, the study drug should be continued. 2019N406358_00"
154,page_154,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 155Participants in the Follow-Up Phase who are receiving ABC as part of their regimen should be evaluated for the possibility of a clinically suspected ABC HSR and managed appropriatel y as outlined in the local prescribing information for ABC. Any rash that is possibly related to study drug, and is present between Day 1 and The Week 4b visit for partic ipants in the Oral Lead -in Phase , must be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to initiation of CAB LA or RPV LA. Any participant receiving at least one dose of CAB L A and /or RPV LA who discontinue IP / Withdraw will initiate treatment with HAART and enter the LTFUPhase for 52 weeks of follow-up. 7.4.6. Suicidal Risk Monitoring Participants with HIV infection may occasionally present with s ymptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation or behavior. In addition, there have been some reports of depression, suicidal ideation and behavior (particularly in participants with a pre -existing history of depression or psy chiatric illness) in some patients being treated with I NIs. Additionally , depression and anxiety has been reported in some participants being treate d with RPV. Therefore, it is appropriate to monitor and closel y observe participants prospectivel y before and during treatment for suicidal ideation and/or behavior, or an y other unusual changes in behavior. It is recommended that the Investigator consid er mental health consultation or referral for participants who experience signs of suicidal ideation or behavior. Participants presenting with new onset/treatment emergent depression should be advised to contact the investigator immediately if symptoms of severe acute depression (including suicidal ideation/attempts) develop, because medical intervention and discontinuation of the study medication may be required. Assessment of treatment -emergent suicidalit y will be monitored during this study using the electronic version of the Columbia Suicide -Severity Rating Scale (eC- SSRS). The definitions of behavioural suicidal events used in this scale are based on those used in the Columbia Suicide History Form [ Posner, 2007]. Questions are asked on suicidal behavior, suicidal ideation, and intensity of ideation. Screening visit questions will be in relation to lifetime experiences and current experiences (within the past 2 months) and all subsequent questioning in relation to the last assessment. The eC -SSRS is to be administered as a patient completed questionnaire specified in the Time and Events Table (Section7.1). The eC -SSRS will be conducted electronicall y by telephone or b y computer/tablet connected to the internet. Additionally , the investigator will collect information using the Possible Suicidality - Related AE (PSRAE) eCRF form in addition to the Adverse Event (non -serious or Serious Adverse Events) eCRF form on an y participant that experiences a possible suicidality -related adverse event while participating in this study . This may include, but is not limited to, an event that involves suicidal ideation, a preparatory act toward imminent suicidal behavior, a suicide attem pt, or a completed suicide. The investigator will exercise his or her medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an event is possibly suicide-related. PSRAE forms should be completed and reported to ViiV/GSK 2019N406358_00"

All sites should have a plan in place for managing possible risks for suicide related events. 7.4.7. Pregnancy 7.4.7.1. Pregnancy testing Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy testat Screening, and at Baseline (Day 1). Pregnancy testing will also be conducted as per the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1) and at any time during the trial when pregnancy is suspected. Additionally , the Medical Mon itor may request that a urine pregnancy test be performed in the event of a treatment interruption greater than 7 day s. 7.4.7.2. Time Period for Collecting Pregnancy Information Pregnancy information will be collected from Day 1 until the last follow -up assessment. This includes the entiret y of the LTFUPhase. Female participants that have received at least one dose of CAB LA or RPV LA and do not enter the LTFUPhase should use an acceptable method of contraception ( see the SPM for a listing of examples of acceptab le hormonal contraception) until at least 52 weeks after the last dose of study drug. If a participant becomes pregnant within 52 weeks of the last dose of study drug the participant should notify the study site. 7.4.7.3. Action to be Taken if Pregnancy Occurs Anyindividual who becomes pregnant (intrauterine) while participating in this study must be withdrawn from the study and must immediately discontinue study drug. Participants who have received at least one dose of CAB LA and/or RPV LA should discontinue fur ther dosing and continue oral HAART in the LTFUPhase (see Section 4.2.4above), after discussion with the Medical Monitor. Any pregnancy that occurs during stud y participation must be reported using a clinica l trial pregnancy form. To ensure participant safety, if a pregnancy is reported then the investigator should inform GSK within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in Appendix 7. Participants who have received at least one IM injection of CAB LA and RPV L A and become pregnant during the study will have additional PK samples collections to monitor CAB LA and RPV LA exposure throughout the pregnancy and at the time of delivery. Additionally , there will be an optional umbilical cord blood collection at time of delivery and/or breast milk after delivery , requiring additional parental informed consent. Cord blood and breast milk samples would be used to better understand the level of PK exposure to the neonate, if any . The pregnancy must be followed up to determine outcome (including premature termination) and status of mother and child(ren). Pregnancy complications and elective 2019N406358_00"

Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the investigator’s attention after the participant has completed the study and considered by the investigator as possibly related to the study treatment, must be promptly reported to ViiV/GSK. GSK’s central safet y department will also forward this information to the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry. The international registry is jointly sponsored by manufacturers or licensees of ARV products. Additional information and a list of participating manufacturers/licensees are available from http://apregistry .com/index.htm. 7.4.8. Physical Exams Physical exams should be conducted as part of normal routine clinical care . Abnormalities noted during an y exam must be recorded in the eCRF (e.g., in the current medical conditions or AE logs). A complete ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum, assessment of the Cardiovascular, Respiratory , Gastrointestinal, and Neurological sy stems. Height and weight will also be measured and recorded as per the Time and Events Table in Section 7.1above. A brief ph ysical examination will include, at a minimum assessments of the skin, lungs, cardiovascular s ystem, and abdomen (liver and spleen). The site of IM injection administration should be assessed at every visit for signs of an y possible reaction. See Section 7.4.5.10for additional information. Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious illnesses. 7.4.9. Vital Signs Vital signs will be measured in semi -supine position after 5 minutes rest and will include temperature, sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate. These will be recorded as per the Time and Events Table in Section 7.1. 7.4.10. Electrocardiogram (ECG) A 12-lead ECG will be performed in a semi- supine position. On Day 1, (Baseline), ECGs should be performed in triplicate prior to first dose. At Day 1and Week 48 of the Maintenance Phase, a 2 hour post dose ECG will be performed for participants receiving CAB LA + RPV LA with an allowable window of 30 minutes. An ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and measures PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals is preferred, and these calculated numbers can be used for reporting purposes. Otherwise, an appropriatel y qualified ECG reader must interpret the results. The same interpreter should assess all ECGs for each participant. Regardless, each ECG should be reviewed by a qualified ECG reader. The qualified ECG reader will make the non -calculated ECG interpretations. Refer to the Time and Events Table for collection timepoints (Section 2019N406358_00"

Pharmacokinetics Plasma samples for determination of CAB and RPV concentration swill be collected throughout the Maintenance and Extension Phases of the study . Additional samples will be collected for storage during the LTFUPhase (blood and plasma). Samples (blood and plasma) for determination of RPV concentrations will be protect ed from light at all times, from sampling collection through anal ysis. 7.5.1. PK Sample Collection Blood samples for evaluation of CAB (2mL each) and RPV (2 mL each) plasma PK concentrations will be collected from all participants as described in Table 10. For participants transitioning from oral SOC, at Week 4b PK samples should be collected within the window of 20 -28 hours after the last oral dose of CAB + RPV was taken the day prior to the clinic visit. Participants w ill take their final dose of oral CAB + RPV in the clinic at Week 4b after the pre -dose PK sample. These participants will be expected to complete a PK dosing diary card noting the date and time of the last three oral doses of IP prior to the scheduled cl inicvisits at Week 4b. The information from the diary card and the actual date and time of the PK samples will be recorded in the eCRF. Additionally , dosing information on the clinic day , including dosing and the actual date and time of the PK samples, must be recorded on the eCRF . Plasmaconcentrations will be summarized and used to evaluate potential exposure - response relationships. The timing of PK samples may be altered and/or PK samples may be obtained at additional time points to ensure thorough PK monitoring. 2019N406358_00"

Rationale of PK Sampling Strategy Blood sampling for CAB and RPV concentrations will be performed during the Maintenance Phase of the study to evaluate PK in HIV infected participants. The proposed PK visits and sampling scheme at each visit presente d in Section 7.1 is based on consideration of available PK data to support interim and final PK and PK/Pharmacod ynamic (PD) anal ysis planned in this study . 7.5.3.

Raw data will be archived at the bioanalytical site (detailed in the SRM). Once the plasma has been anal yzed for CAB any remaining plasma may be analyzed for other compound -related metabolites and the results reported under a separate GSK PTS - DMPK, GSK protocol. No human DNA anal ysis will be performed on these samples. 7.5.3.2. RPV Sample A nalysis Plasma RPV analy sis will be performed under the control of Janssen R&D. Concentrations of RPV will be determined in plasma samples using the currentl y approved bioanal ytical methodology . Raw data will be archived at the bioanaly tical site. Once the plasma has been anal yzed for RPV any remaining plasma may be used by the sponsor for further exploratory work on pharmacokinetics, metabolites, plasma protein binding, prote in analysis, and biochemistry . No human DNA analy sis will be performed on these samples. 7.6. Genetics Information regarding genetic research is included in Appendix 5: Genetic Research. 7.7. Viral Genoty ping and Phenoty ping Whole venous blood samples will be obtained from each participant to provide PBMCs and plasma for storage samples according to the Time and Events Table (see Section 7.1) for potential viral genot ypic and phenot ypic analyses. Details concerning the handling, labeling and shipping of these samples will be supplied separately . Genotypic and phenotypic anal yses may be carried out by Monogram Biosciences using, but not limited to, their Standard PhenoSense and GenoSu re testing methods for protease (PRO), reverse transcriptase (RT), and integrase assays. 2019N406358_00"

HIV-1 Exploratory Analysis Additional analy ses for HIV -1 resistance may , for example, be carried out on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples collected at Baseline and/or on stored blood samples from other relevant time points. These analy sesmay include but are not limited to additional viral genotyping and/or phenotyping, as well as other virologic evaluations such as linkage and minority species anal yses, low level HIV -1RNA quantitation and measurement of viral replicative capacity . HIV-1 PRO and RT genot ype andphenotype and HIV-1 integrase genoty pe and phenot ype will also be determined on the last on - treatment isolates from participants who have HIV- 1 RNA 200 c/mL regardless of confirmatory HIV-1 RNA. 7.8. Value Evidence and Outcomes Health outcomes assessments will be conducted according to the Time and Events Table (Section 7.1). Assessments are recommended to be administered with a paper instrument at the beginning of the visit prior to collecti on of blood for anal ysis and other scheduled assessments . The “Preference” questionnaire will assess whether patients prefer the CAB L A + RPV LA injectable treatment or the daily oral ARV regimen, and assess preference for the CAB LA + RPV LA Q8W regimen or CAB LA + RPV L A Q4W regimen. The “Preference” questionnaire will include 3 questions evaluating preference of HIV treatment and the attributes supporting this preference. The HIV Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (HIVTSQ) [ Woodcock , 2001 and Woodcock , 2006] was developed to evaluate treatments for HIV and patient satisfaction. The original HIVTSQ included 10 items and underwent two stages of ps ychometric validation ( Woodcock , 2001, Woodcock , 2006). Recently, the HIVTSQ was adapted to include injectable treatment for HIV following a qualitative study with HIV patients in five European countr ies. The adaptation of the HIVTSQ included two additional items related to the mode of administration (i.e., long acting intramuscular injection) . These are: 2019N406358_00 CCI - This section contained Clinical Outcome Assessment data collection questionnaires or indices, which are protected by third party copyright laws and therefore have been excluded."
161,page_161,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 162Psychometric anal yses from three datasets (one from the UK, one from the USA and one from the LATTE -2 trial) reveal that the addition of two items in the original version of the HIVTSQ is suitable and does not reduce the overall validity of the questionnaire. The current stud y will be using the HIVTSQs (status version) and the revised HIVTSQc (change version) of this recentl y developed HIVTSQ 12 -item questionnaire. The HIVTSQ 12-item questionnaire retains the option of calculating the total score as if it only had the original 10 items (as the original 10 items are included in the HIV -TSQ12). In addition, it allows for calculation of an 11 -item scale score including the “ ” item (item -11). The “ ” item (item -12) will be included in the questionnaire as a stand- alone item to evaluate potentially painful injectables. These measures will assess change in treatment satisfaction ov er time (in the same participants) and compare current satisfaction with previous treatment satisfaction, from an earlier time point. The Perception of Injection (PI N)questionnaire explores the bother of pain at the injection site and I SR, anxiety before and after injection, willingness to receive an HIV injectable treatment the following visit and satisfaction with the mode of treatment administration of individuals receiving injection and perceptions of individuals associated with receiving injections. The PIN questionnaire was derived from the Vaccines' Perception of Injection (VAPI) questionnaire ( Chevat, 2009), and adapted for HIV - infected patients who will receive the CAB LA and RPV L A regimen. This measure contains 21 items that measure pain at injection site, local site reactions, impact on functioning and willingness to pursue injectable treatment outside of a clinical trial . Scores range from 1 to 5, and questions are phrased in such a way as to ensure that 1 always equated with the most favourable perception of vaccination, and 5 the most unfavourable. The ACCEPT questionnaire is a generic medication acceptance measure assessing how patients weigh advantages and disadvantages of long- term medications ( Marant, 2012). ACCEPT may be a predictor of patients' future adherence to and/or persistence with their treatment. While the ACCEPT questionnaire consists of 25 items that capture six dimensions, we will use three questions that focus on general acceptance of study medication. The HIV/AIDS Targeted Quality of Life (HAT -QoL) instrument [ Holmes, 1998] originally contained 42 items, grouped into nine dimensions, assessing overall function and well-being. For the purposes of this study , ViiV Healthcare is using a shorter version adapted from the original version. This shorter version contains 14 items grouped into the three following dimensions: “life satisfaction”, “disclosure worries” and “HIV medication”.

STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS AND DA TA ANALYSES The study is designed to demonstrate that the antiviral effect of Q8W dosing with CAB LA + RPV LA is non- inferior to Q4W dosing CAB LA + RPV LA in subjects stably suppressed on an oral SOC regimen or Q4W CAB L A + RPV LA regimen prior to randomization. Non -inferiority in the proportion of participants with HIV-RNA 50 c/mL at Week 48 (defined by the US FDA snapshot algorithm) can be concluded if the upper bound of a two -sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between the two treatment arms (Q8W –Q4W) is less than 4%. 2019N406358_00"
165,page_165,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 166If fQ8Wis the snapshot failure rate for Q8W CAB LA + RP V LA, and f Q4Wis the snapshot failure rate for Q4 W CAB LA + RPV LA then the hy potheses can be written as follows: H0: fQ8W– fQ4W4% vsH1: f Q8W– fQ4W< 4% 9.1. Sample Size Considerations . This study will randomize approximately 510 participants per arm. A ssuming the true proportion with HIV -1 RNA 50 c/mL is 3% for the Q8W arm and 2% for the Q4W arm, a non-inferiority margin of 4%, and a 2.5% one- sided significance level, this sample size would provide at least 85% power to show non -inferiority at Week 48 (using unpooled Z test statistic). With this sample size, 90% power would be achieved assuming a 1% treatment difference and true proportions with HIV- 1 RNA 50 c/mL of 2.63% for the Q8W arm and 1.63% for the Q4W arm. With 510 subjects per arm and assumin g an observed proportion HIV -RNA 50 c/mL is 2% for Q4W, the largest observed treatment difference to achieve non -inferiority with respect to a 4% margin is 1.92 percentage points. This equates approximately to observing an excess of 10 subjects on the Q8 W arm (10 subjects on Q4W vs. 20 subjects on Q8W). This sample size of 510participants per arm will also provide at least 90% power (using unpooled Z test statistic ) to show non- inferiority in the proportion of participants with plasma HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL (per FDA’s snapshot algorithm) at Week 48 over a range of true response rates, on the basis of a - 10% non-inferiority margin and 2.5% one -sided significance level (see Figure 15). For example, assuming true respon se rate for the Q8W arm and Q4W arm are both 92%, the power is  99% to show non- inferiority for this key secondary endpoint. 9.1.1. Rationale for non -inferiority margin A non-inferiority margin of 4% has been chosen for this study because a snapshot proportion wi th HIV-1 RNA 50 c/mLat Week 48 in this range is considered clinicall y tolerable given the Q8W regimen will offer important advantages over the Q4W regimen such as reduced injection frequency , and may offer better adherence and treatment satisfaction. Th is margin is also in concordance with the current FDA Guidance for Industry (FDA, 2015), which is the most current regulatory guidance from either the European Medicines Agency (EMA)or FDA and includes specific recommen dations regarding switch studies. 9.1.2. Assumption for Snapshot Proportion with HIV -RNA 50 c/mL at Week 48 (Primary Endpoint) For the sample size calculation, assumptions regarding the true proportion with HIV RNA 50 c/mL for each arm were informed by data from the LATTE -2 Phase 2b study (Table 11). These data suggest a rate of 2% for Q4W and a possibly higher rate in the neighbourhood of 3% for Q8W. 2019N406358_00"
166,page_166,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 167Two important changes to the current study in relation to the L ATTE-2 study were also considered in setting the sample size. Firstly, the loading dose schedule for Q8W has been modified in an attempt to optimize the pharmacokinetics of CAB LA + RPV L A. Secondly, a re-testing strategy (seeSection5.5.5.1) has been added to reduce the number of subjects counted as having HIV RNA 50 c/mLin the primary analysis at key timepoints because of transient blips (consistent with the FDA’s guidance for the Snapshot endpoint). Through th ese changes, it is possible that the proportions with HI V RNA 50 copies/mL will be lower than that observed in the LATTE -2 study.

Assumption for R esponse Rate at Week 48 (Secondary Endpoint) Given the response rates shown in Table 11, a reasonable assumption for the true response rate (HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL) for both arms is 92%. 9.1.4. Sample Size Sensitivity Figure 15a (left panel) shows the sensitivity of the power curve for the primary comparison to different assumed ‘true’ proportions with HI V -RNA 50c/mLwith 510 randomized participants per arm based on calculations usingan unpooled Z test statistic and asymptotic approximation . For example, if the true rate for Q8W is 1.5 percentage points higher than Q4W ( greenline), then the study would still have over 80% power to meet its primary objective if the Q4W rate is less t han 1.3%. Figure 15b (right panel) shows the impact on power to changes in the sample size assuming a 2% true -rate for Q4W. Power remains at least 80% for sample sizes as low as 425per arm if the true Q8W rate is at most 1-percentage point inferior to Q4W. 2019N406358_00"

Intent-to-Treat Exposed (ITT -E) The ITT-E population will consist of all randomly assigned participants who receive at least one dose of stud y drug. Participants will be assessed according to their randomized treatment, regardless of the treatment they received. The population used in t he primary efficacy analysis will be the ITT -E population. 9.2.1.2. Per-Protocol Population (PP) The Per-Protocol (PP) Population will consist of all participants in the ITT- E Population with the exception of major protocol violators. The PP will be used for sensit ivity analysis of the primary endpoint. 2019N406358_00"
169,page_169,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 1709.2.1.3. PK Population The PK Population will include all participants who receive CAB and / or RPVand undergo PK sampling during the stud y, and provide evaluable CAB and /or RPV plasma concentration data. Participants in this population will be included in the PK analysis. 9.2.1.4. Safety Population The Safet y Population will consist of all randomly assigned participants who receive at least one dose of stud y drug. Participants will be assessed according to actual treatment received. Unless otherwise stated, the Safety Population will be used for safet y analyses. 9.2.2. Treatment Comparisons 9.2.2.1. Primary Comparison of Interest The primary analysis will be based on the ITT- E population. The primary comparison will be made at a one- sided 2.5% lev el of significance . Treatment with Q8W will be declared non -inferior to Q4W if the upper end of a two -sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between the two groups (Q8W –Q4W) in the proportion of participants with HIV -RNA 50 c/mL at Week 48 (defined by the US FDA snapshot algorithm) lies below 4%. 9.2.2.2. Other Comparisons of Interest The analysis described above will also be performed using the PP population and the results will be compared for consistency with the results from the ITT- E population. If the primary comparison on interest using the ITT -E population demonstrates non - inferiority of Q8W compared to Q4W then the following key secondary comparisons will be tested: Treatment with Q8W will be declared non- inferior to Q4W with respect to the pr oportion of participants with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Week 48 (defined b y the US FDA snapshot algorithm) if the lower end of a two -sided 95% confidence interval for the difference between in rates (Q8W –Q4W) lies above -10% using the ITT -E population Superiority of Q8W compared to Q4Wwith respect to change from baseline HIVTSQs total score at Week 48 using the ITT- E population and a two -sided 5% level of significance 9.2.3. Planned A nalyses At least threeanalyseswill be conducted to evaluate the objectives of the protocol after all subjects have completed their visits at Week 24, Week 48 and Week 96, respectivel y. Further data cuts and analy ses may be conducted as necessary in order to support regulatory submissions and publications (first publication at We ek 48). The Week 48 analysis will be primary and no results will be shared publicly until Week 48 anal ysis is complete. Full details for the primary Week 48 analy sis (and preliminary Week 24 2019N406358_00"
170,page_170,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 171analysis) will be prespecified in the RAP prior to the database freeze for the Week 24 analysis and sponsor review of any summary of data grouped b y actual treatment arm. 9.2.3.1. Week 24 data analyses An analysis of data through Week 24 will be conducted when all subjects have completed their Week 24 visit, with the intent of expediting submission of results to health authorities. The analyses described in Section 9.3.2.2, Section9.3.3and Section9.3.6 will be performed. Health outcomes anal yses will not be performed. There is no intention to stop the study early if positive efficacy findings are seen at Week 24 and a formal hy pothesis test of non- inferiority at Week 24 will not be evaluated. The analysis at Week 48 is primary and will overrule the findings based on the Week 24 data. Therefore, no multiplicity adjustment to the primary Week 48 treatment comparisons is needed because of the analy sis of Week 24 data. Neither investigators nor subjects will be informed of the results of the Week 24 data analysis. Sponsor staff will only review aggregate data b y actual treatment arm after the Week 24 IDMC evaluation is complete as required in the preparation of submission documents. 9.2.3.2. IDMC analy ses Independent review will be provided b y an IDMC to ensure external objective medical and/or statistical review of efficacy and safety in order to protect the ethical interests and well-being of subjects and to protect the scientific validity of this study . An ad-hoc review of data b y the IDMC will be triggered whenever the number of confirmed virologic failures in the CAB LA + RPV LA Q8W arm exceeds thresholds pre-specified in the IDMC charter. Further, an interim futility analysis will be performed for the IDMC to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of CAB LA + RPV LA Q8W arm when approximately 50% of subjects have completed their visit at Week 24; the sponsor will remain blinded to this analy sis. Any additional Week 24 analyses will also be shared with the IDMC. Full details of the methods, timing, decision criteria and operating characteristics will be pre-specified in the IDMC Charter. Since the statistical stopping guidelines will not result in early stopping due to positive efficacy findings for the Q8W regimen, these planned anal yses will not inflate the t ype I error rate for the primary treatment comparison at Week 48. 9.3. Key Elements of A nalysis Plan 9.3.1. Primary Analyses For the primary efficacy analysis, virologic outcome for each participant in the I ntent-to- Treat Exposed population will be calculated according to the FDA’s Snapshot algorithm. The primary analysis at Week 48 will take place after the last participant has had their Week 48 viral load assessed, including a retest if required. 2019N406358_00"
171,page_171,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 172As defined by the Snapshot algorithm, HIV -RNA 50 copies/mL is determined by the last available HIV -1 RNA measurement while the participant is on treatment within the analysis visit window of interest. In addition, participants without evaluable HIV -RNA data for the visit of interest and who discontinue from the maintenance phase for reasons not related to adverse event with HI V-1 RNA result at the time of discontinuation  50copies/mL or who change study treatment not permitted per protocol before the analysis window are classified as having HIV- RNA 50 copies/mL . For the primary efficacy analysis, the adjusted difference between the randomized arms for the proportion of participants with HIV- 1 RNA 50c/mL at Week 48 (according to the FDA snapshot algorithm) and its confidence interval will be calculated according to a stratified anal ysis with Cochran -Mantel Haenszel (CMH) weights. This analy sis will adjust for the randomization strata (rederived for analy sis to correct for stratification errors)according to pri or exposure to CAB + RPV (0 weeks, 1-24weeks, >24 weeks). The CMH estimate of the common difference in rates across strata will be calculated as the weighted average of the strata- specific estimates of the difference in proportion between the two arms a s follows: • If nk is the number of Q8W treated participants, mk is the number of Q4W arm treated participants, and Nk = nk + mk is the total number of participants in the kth stratum, then the CMH estimate is given b y  kk k cmh Wd W dˆ ˆ where kk k kNm nW are CMH weights and kdˆ are estimates of the differences in proportions between the two treatment arms, f Q8W-fQ4W, for the kth stratum. The corresponding two -sided 95% CI will be calculated as: using the variance estimator given b y [Sato, 1989], which is consistent in both sparse data and large strata. The formula for computing the Sato variance estimate will be provided in the RAP. Non -inferiority will be declared if the upper bound of the two- sided 95% confidence interval for the difference (Q8W –Q4W) is less than 4%. The weighted least squares chi- squared statistic [ Fleiss, 1981] will be used to assess evidence of trea tment difference heterogeneity across strata. strata,Following Lui and 2019N406358_00"

Detailed explanations of the derivation of visit windows will be included in the RAP. Any changes to the original analy sis plan in the protocol will be described in the RAP and/or clinical study report (CSR). 9.3.2. Secondary Analyses 9.3.2.1. Key Secondary Efficacy Analysis A key secondary analysis will evaluate the proportion of participants with HIV -1 RNA <50 c/mL (according to the FDA’s Snapshot algorithm) at Week 48 for the ITT -E population. Participants with last available HIV -1 RNA measurement less than 50copies/mL while the particip ant is on treatment within the analy sis visit window of interest are classified as responders; participants without evaluable HIV- RNA data for the visit of interest or who change treatment not permitted per protocol before the anal ysis window are considere d non-responders. Full details on the Snapshot algorithm for computation of the proportion with HI V-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL will be contained in the RAP. The adjusted difference between the randomized arms for the proportions (Q8W – Q4W) and its confidence i nterval will be calculated according to a stratified anal ysis with Cochran-Mantel Haenszel (CMH) weights, as described for primary endpoint (Section 9.3.1). A non-inferiority margin of -10% will be used for this secondary comparison, where if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference between the rates (Q8W –Q4W) is greater than -10%, non- inferiority will be demonstrated. 9.3.2.2. Other Secondary Endpoint A nalyses The primary analysis (Section 9.3.1) and key secondary efficacy analysis (Section 9.3.2.1) will be repeated at Week 96, with the only difference being a change in time point from Week 48 to Week 96 for determining the snapshot outcomes. For the Week 24 planned anal yses, the adjusted treatment difference in p roportion of participants with plasma HIV-1 RNA 50c/mL(FDA Snapshot algorithm , with 95% confidence interval ) at Week 24 will be calculated u sing the methodology described in Section 9.3.1, but no formal test of non -inferiority will be performed at this earl y timepoint. 2019N406358_00"

VSLC Guidelines for Drug Restart or Rechallenge after stop for Liver criteria Drug Rechallenge refers to resuming stud y treatment following drug induced liver injury (DILI). Because of the risks associated with rechallenge after DILI (see Drug Rechallenge Background below) this should only be considered for a participant for whom there is compelling evidence of benefit from a critical or life -saving medicine, there is no alternative approved medicine available, and a benefit:risk assessment of rechallenge is considered to be favorable ( Table 12,Figure 17). Drug Restart refers to resuming study treatment following liver events meeting stopping criteria in which ther e is a clear underlying cause (other than DILI) of the liver event (e.g., biliary obstruction, pancreatic events, hypotension, acute viral hepatitis) . Furthermore, there should be no evidence of alcoholic hepatitis or hy persensitivity , and the drug should not be associated with HLA markers of liver injury . (Table 13;Figure 18). As this determination can be difficult, for the purpose of these guidelines, cases should be treated as rechallenges if there is any reasonable likelihood that the liver event is related to study drug. Restarts should be limited to cases in which there is clear evidence that the underlying cause of the liver event is not related to study drug. DRUG RE CHALLENGE Background: Following drug- induced liver injury, drug rechallenge is associated with a 13% mortality across all drugs in prospective studies [ Andrade, 2009]. Clinical outcomes vary by drug, with nearl y 50%fatality with halothane re -administered within one month of initial injury . However, some drugs seldom result in recurrent liver injury or fatality. Risk factors for a fatal drug rechallenge outcome include: hypersensitivity [Andrade, 2009] with initial liver injury (e.g. fever, rash, eosinophilia) jaundice or bilirubin >2xULN with initial liver injury (direct bilirubin >35% of total) participant currentl y exhibits severe liver injury defined by: ALT 3xULN, bilirubin 2xULN (direct bilirubin >35% of total), or INR1.5 prior serious adverse event or fatality has earlier been observed with drug rechallenge [ Papay, 2009; Hunt, 2010] evidence of d rug-related nonclinical liability (e.g. reactive metabolites; mitochondrial impairment [ Hunt, 2010]) 2019N406358_00"

Appendix 5: Genetic Research Genetic Research Objectives and A nalyses The objectives of the genetic research are to investigate a relationship between genetic variants and: Response to medicine, including CAB + RPV or any concomitant medicines; HIV-1 susceptibility , severity and progr ession and related conditions. Genetic data may be generated while the study is underway or following completion of the study. Genetic evaluations may include focused candidate gene approaches and/or examination of a large number of genetic variants thro ughout the genome (whole genome analyses). Genetic anal yses will utilize data collected in the study and will be limited to understanding the objectives highlighted above. Analyses may be performed using data from multiple clinical studies to investigate these research objectives. Appropriate descriptive and/or statistical analy sis methods will be used. A detailed description of an y planned anal yses will be documented in a RAP prior to initiation of the analysis. Planned anal yses and results of genetic inv estigations will be reported either as part of the clinical RAP and study report, or in a separate genetics RAP and report, as appropriate. Study Population Any participant who is enrolled in the clinical study can participate in genetic research. Any participant who has received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant must be excluded from genetic research. Study Assessments and Procedures A key component of successful genetic research is the collection of samples during clinical studies. Collection of sample s, even when no a priorihypothesis has been identified, may enable future genetic anal yses to be conducted to help understand variability in disease and medicine response. A 6 mL blood sample will be taken for deoxy ribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction. A blood sample is collected at the baseline visit, after the participant has been randomized and provided informed consent for genetic research. Instructions for collection and shipping of the genetic sample are described in the laboratory manual. The DNA fr om thebloodsample may undergo quality control analy ses to confirm the integrit y of the sample. If there are concerns regarding the quality of the sample, then the sample may be destroyed. The bloodsample is taken on a single occasion unless a duplicate sample is required due to an inabilit y to utilize the original sample. The genetic sample is labelled (or “coded”) with the same stud y specific number used to label other samples and data in the study . This number can be traced or linked back to 2019N406358_00"
218,page_218,"2017N326521_02 CONFIDENTIA L 207966 219the participant b y the investigator or site staff. Coded samples do not carry personal identifiers (such as name or social security number). Samples will be stored securel y and may be kept for up to 15 years after the last participant completes the study , or GSK may destroy the samples sooner. GSK or those working with GSK (for example, other researchers) will only use samples collected from the study for the purpose stated in this protocol and in the informed consent form. Samples may be used as part of the development of a companion diagnostic to support the GSK medicinal product. Participants can request their sample to be destro yed at any time. Informed Consent Participants who do not wish to participate in the genetic research may still participate in thestudy. Genetic informed consent must be obtained prior to an y blood being taken. Participant Withdrawal from Study If a participant who has consented to participate in genetic research withdraws from the clinical study for any reason other than being los t to follow -up, the participant will be given a choice of one of the following options concerning the genetic sample, if alread y collected: Continue to participate in the genetic research in which case the genetic DNA sample is retained Discontinue partic ipation in the genetic research and destroy the genetic DNA sample. If a participant withdraws consent for genetic research or requests sample destruction for any reason, the investigator must complete the appropriate documentation to request sample destr uction within the timeframe specified by ViiV/GSK and maintain the documentation in the site study records. Genotype data may be generated during the study or after completion of the study and may be analyzed during the study or stored for future anal ysis. If a participant withdraws consent for genetic research and genot ype data has not been analy zed, it will not be anal yzed or used for future research. Genetic data that has been anal yzed at the time of withdrawn consent will continue to be stored and use d, as appropriate. Screen and Baseline Failures If a sample for genetic research has been collected and it is determined that the participant does not meet the entry criteria for participation in the study , then the investigator should instruct the partici pant that their genetic sample will be destroy ed.

Provision of Study Results and Confidentiality of Participant’s Genetic Data ViiV/GSK may summarize the genetic research results in the CSR, or separately , and may publish the results in scientific journals. ViiV/GSK may share genetic research data with other scientists to further scientific understanding in alignment with the informed consent. GSK does not inform the participant, family members, insurers, or emplo yers of individual genot yping results that are not known to be relevant t o the participant’s medical care at the time of the study,unless required b y law. This is due to the fact that the information generated from genetic studies is generally preliminary in nature, and therefore the significance and scientific validity of theresults are undetermined. Further, data generated in a research laboratory may not meet regulatory requirements for inclusion in clinical care. 2019N406358_00"

Definition of A dverse Events Adverse Event Definition: An AE is an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant, temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. NOTE: An AE can therefore be an yunfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), s ymptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product. Events meeting AE definition include: Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology , clinical chemistry , or urinaly sis) or other safet y assessments (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, and felt to be clinically significant in the medical and scientific judgement of the investigator. Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions det ected or diagnosed after study treatment administration even though it may have been present prior to the start of the study . Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction. Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected ove rdose of either study treatment or a concomitant medication (overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless this is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self - harming intent. This should be reported regardless of sequelae). ""Lack of efficacy "" or ""failure of expected pharmacological action"" per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. However, the signs and sy mptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from lack of efficacy will be reported if they fulfil the definition of an AE or S AE. 2019N406358_00"

Definition of Serious A dverse Events If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (e.g., hospitalization for signs/sy mptoms of the disease under study , death due to progression of disease, etc.). Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: Results in death Is life-threatening NOTE: The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. I t does not refer to an event, which hypotheticall y might have caused death, if it were more severe. Requires hospitalization or pr olongation of existing hospitalization NOTE: In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay ) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the phy sician’s office or out -patientsetting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfillsany other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary , the AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen 2019N406358_00"

Results in disability/incapacity NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relativel y minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent every day life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should b e exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or s urgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse Is associated with liver injury andimpaired liver function defined as: ALT 3xULN and total bilirubin*2xULN (>35% dir ect), or ALT 3xULN and INR**> 1.5. * Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available; if unavailable, measure urinary bilirubin via dipstick. I f fractionation is unavailable and ALT 3xULN and total bilirubin  2xULN, then th e event is still to be reported as an SAE. ** INR testing not required per protocol and the threshold value does not apply to participants receiving anticoagulants.

In this instance, all participant identifiers, with the exception of the participant number, will be blinded on the copies of the medica l records prior to submission to GSK. The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on s igns, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis will be documented as the AE/SAE and not the individual signs/sy mptoms. Participant -completed Value Evidence and Outcomes questionnaires and the collection of AE data are inde pendent components of the study . Responses to each question in the Value Evidence and Outcomes questionnaire will be treated in accordance with standard scoring and statistical procedures detailed b y the scale’s developer. The use of a single question from a multidimensional health survey to designate a cause-effect relationship to an AE is inappropriate. 2019N406358_00"

Evaluating AEs and SA Es Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the stud y and will assign it to one of the following categories: Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with every day activities. Moderate: An event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere wit h normal everyday activities Severe: An event that prevents normal every day activities. -an AE that is assessed as severe will not be confused with an SAE. Severity is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the pre -defined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE. Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between stud y treatment and the occurrence of each AE/SAE. A ""reasonable possibility "" is meant to convey that there are facts/evidence or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underly ing diseases, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event to the study treatment will be considered and investigated. The investig ator will also consult the I nvestigator Brochure (IB) and/or Product Information, for marketed products, in the determination of his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE the investigator mustdocument in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality . There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event prior to the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK. The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information, amending the SAE data collection tool accordingl y. The causality assessment i s one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. 2019N406358_00"
