BACKGROUND 1.1 Overview XBiotech USA, Inc. has developed a True Human monoclonal antibody, Bermekimab , that binds the cytokine IL -1α with high affinity and is an effective blocker of IL -1α biological activity. IL - 1α is a key mediator of sterile inflammatory responses and has been implicated in the pathology of advanced cancer, cardiovascular disease, and rheumatologic disease. Clinical evidence generated to date suggests that targeting IL -1α may be an effective treatment in undermining the inflammatory process that drives a wide array of diseases, including dermatologic conditions. The active ingredient in the drug product bermekimab is MABp1, a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody spe cific for human interleukin-1 α (IL-1α). The entire bermekimab heavy and light chain sequences are identical to those found in naturally -occurring human IgG1 κ, with the light and heavy chain variable regions being identical to those originally expressed by a peripheral blood B lymphocyte that was obtained from a healthy individual. No in vitro affinity maturation or modifications have been made to improve its natural binding affinity (211 +/- 31 pM). We believe that a true human antibody should be effectively non- immunogenic in humans and thus exhibit optimal activity and pharmacokinetics. XBiotech has conducted 10 clinical studies to date using the bermekimab antibody. These studies have been conducted in a wide range of therapeutic areas, from cancer to healthy volunteers, and have included a several different dose levels and dosing schedules. Both intravenous and subcutaneous formulations have been explored for safety and evidence of efficacy. Three phase 2 studies sponsored by XBiotech have been completed in dermatologic indications (acne, psoriasis and pyoderma gangrenosum), along with one investigator sponsored study in Hidradenitis Suppurativa 1,2,3. Subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis experienced a rapid reduction in their psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), and subjects with acne vulgaris experienced reductions of inflammatory lesion counts, as well as reduced hospital anxiety and depression scores (HADS). In both of these trials, there were few adverse events, which were all grade 1 (mild) and the only events that appeared to be related to therapy were mild injection site reactions in two patients. The investigator initiated study enrolled patients with moderate to severe HS that were refractory to or not eligible for treatment with TNF blocking agents . The study was double blind, randomized"

PROTOCOL 2018- PT045 Version 3.1 CONFIDENTIAL 30 August 2018 PAGE 12 of 50 and placebo controlled, and utilized the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) score as a primary endpoint. Ten patients were randomized to placebo and 10 patients to treatment with bermekimab . A positive HiSCR score after 12 weeks was found in one (10%) and six (60%) patients respectively (OR: 13.5 0; 95%CIs: 1.19- 152.61; p: 0.035). After withdrawal of therapy at week 12, a positive HiSCR score was found in nil (0%) of the placebo group and four (40%) of the treated patients after 24 weeks (p: 0.043). Endogenous anti -IL-1α antibodies are present in 5% to 28% of the general population 4,5,6,7. No negative correlations with disease have been noted for these individuals. To the contrary, the presence of natural anti- IL-1α antibodies has been associated with favorable outcomes, both with respect to rheumatoid arthritis and ischemic heart disease. Animal studies also indicate that IL -1α loss or antagonism does not result in harm. Moreover, the well -tolerated use of other approved biological agents that employ alternative other strategies to block IL -1 activity suggest that bermekimab’s targeting of IL -1α represents a safe treatment approach. 1.2 Rationale Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a common disorder affecting areas of the skin rich in apocrine glands. HS typically starts at adolescence. The c linical course is characterized by exacerbations and remissions o f flare-ups. During these flare -ups the affected gland becomes swollen and then ruptures, with the discharge of purulent material. The duration of a flare -up is typically 3 -5 days and is char acterized by pain and difficulty in movement. Emotional stress is commonly associated with flare-ups, and flare-ups are commonly present in women before menses. As the disease progresses, fistulas are formed under the dermis. These fistulas often suppurate continuously 8. This chronic inflammation and the accompanying pain account for the fact that HS is ranked first among skin disorders in terms of adversely affecting quality of life9. HS is a common disorder. Its prevalence in Europe is 0.97% 3 whereas in Denmark this figure is reported to be 4%4. A recent review of electronic records in the United States revealed an incidence of 11.4 per 100,000 in the general population incidence10. The incidence was 2.5 times higher among African Americans than among white Americans11. Based on findings showing high expression of tumor necrosis factor -alpha (TNFα) in the lesions of patients 12, the fully humanized monoclonal anti -TNF antibody adalimumab was studied for"
12,page_12,"XBIOTECH USA INC. PROTOCOL 2018- PT045 Version 3.1 CONFIDENTIAL 30 August 2018 PAGE 13 of 50 treatment of HS. Two large -scale randomized clinical studies (RCT) were conducted, designated PIONEER I and PIONEER II, which shared a common study design. Following an initial loading dose of 160 mg and a second 80 mg dose after two weeks, adalimumab was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 40 mg every week , and efficacy was compared to that in placebo - treated patients. The primary efficacy endpoint for both PIONEER studies was set at 12 weeks of treatment. This efficacy endpoint was the achievement of a positive hidradenitis suppurativa clinical response (HiSCR) score. After the initial 12 -week treatment course, patients allocated to placebo were maintained to placebo whereas patients allocated to adalimumab were either switched to an open label extension (OLE) arm , or were further randomized to placebo, adalimumab 40 mg every other week or adalimumab 40 mg every week. Results showed that a positive HiSCR was found in 28.6% of placebo- treated patients and in 41% of adalimumab -treated patients of the PIONEER I study and in 27.6% of placebo- treated patients and in 58.9% of adalimumab -treated patients in the PIONEER II study 13. As stated above, after the first 12 weeks o f treatment patients initially treated with adalimumab could be further randomized and received another 12 weeks of treatment with placebo, 40mg adalimumab weekly or every othe r week. Analysis showed that approximately half of patients showed a positive initial response to treatment, and half of these maintained this response long -term. As also stated above, after the first 12 weeks of treatment, 88 patients were switched to an OLE receiving 40 mg of adalimumab every week; positive HiSCR was achieved at weeks 120 and 168 in 56.8% and 52.3% respectively 14. Adalimumab has been registered in both USA and Europe for moderate to severe HS based on the results of the two PIONEER studies. Adal imumab is an important advance for the treatment of HS. However, there re mains considerable unmet need for patients with HS, including 41% to 58% of patients who have primary response failures after 12 weeks of adalimumab treatment and the 30- 50% patients that have a positive initial response to treatment but relapse after 12 weeks of therapy. These primary and secondary failures to adalimumab treatment may reflect the biological heterogeneity of the HS. About half of patients , for example , over-express TNFα in their lesions, whereas others have lesions better characterized by the production of cytokines like interleukin (IL) -1β and IL -1α 15. In a small randomized study ten patients were allocated to treatment with placebo and nine patients to treatment with anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist targeting both IL -1β and IL -1α). A positive HiSCR score was achieved in 30% and 78% of patients, respectively (p: 0.039) 16. These results suggested that inhibition of IL - 1 may be a promising treatment strategy , including that for patients evidencing primary or secondary failure of adalimumab."
13,page_13,"XBIOTECH USA INC. PROTOCOL 2018- PT045 Version 3.1 CONFIDENTIAL 30 August 2018 PAGE 14 of 50 An investigator initiated phase II RCT trial among patients not eligible for adalimumab (EudraCT number 2015-002321- 20; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02643654) was recently completed and showed promising results for activity of bermekimab in HS . Twenty patients with severe HS and with either primary or secondary failure of previous antiTNF agents, or who were unwilling to receive subcutaneous adalimumab treatment , were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive, in a blinded fashion, every other week treatment with placebo or bermekimab at a dose of 7.5 mg/kg IV. T reatment was administered intravenously for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was the positive HiSCR score, that was achieved among 10% of patients allocated to placebo and 60% of patients allocated to bermekimab . The odds ratio for positive HiSCR after 12 weeks of treatment was 13.50 (95% confidence intervals 1.19- 152.51, p: 0.035). Analysis of the secondary endpoints showed some remarkable advantages of b ermekimab treatment versus placebo treatment: a) blind follow -up for 12 weeks after stop ping treatment showed that clinical efficacy was sustained , in that a positive HiSCR score was found in 40% of the treatment group and 0% of patients receiving placebo (p: 0.043); b) positive patient reported outcomes were found at week 12 in 70% and 30% respectively (p: 0.010); c) the median time to new HS flare- up was prolonged to 11 weeks and 7 weeks respectively; d) with the use of dermal ultrasound at week 12, a 20% or more decrease in total depth of involved skin lesions was found in 77.8% and 22.2% , respectively (p: 0.029); and e) serum IL - 8 was decreased at week 12 in 90% and 40% respectively (p: 0.029) 17. In previous dermatology studies bermekimab was well tolerated and showed impressive therapeutic activity. Dose ranging for the subcutaneous formulation of bermekimab is now being studied in a 12 week open label treatment regimen for HS in order to establish the basis for further randomized studies using subcutaneous administration. 2. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 2.1 ACTIVE INGREDIENT, PHARMACOLOGIC CLASS, STRUCTURE The active ingredient in the drug product bermekimab is MABp1 , a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human interleukin -1α (IL-1α). The entire bermekimab heavy and light chain sequences are identical to those found in naturally -occurring human IgG1 κ, with the light and heavy chain variable regions being identical to those originally expressed by a peripheral blood B lymphocyte that was obtained from a healthy individual."

PROTOCOL 2018- PT045 Version 3.1 CONFIDENTIAL 30 August 2018 PAGE 15 of 50 Figure 2.1: Bermekimab Antibody The bermekimab primary glycoform has a molecular weight of 148.1 kilodaltons. Like all IgG1 molecules, the heavy chains are joined at their hinge regions through two disulfide linkages, and each heavy chain is joined to one light chain through one disulfide linkage between their CH 1 and CL domains respectively. The main isoform has a pI of about 9.2 and comprises about 70- 80% of the total isoform population in all lots that have been manufactured to date, as determined by capillary isoelectric focusing. The heavy chain CH 2 domains are glycosylated primarily with the oligosaccharide structure shown in Figure 2.1, as determined by mass spectroscopy of the cleaved glycans. The glycosylated residue (Asn -302 as numbered from the N -terminus of bermekimab ) has been determined by peptide mapping to be in the same highly conserved N -linked glycosylation site as found in endogenous IgG1 (Asn -297 according to the gener ic numbering system). Similarly, the primary glycan, commonly referred to as G0F, is the same as that found on about 22% of endogenous human IgG molecules 18. The entire bermekimab heavy and light chain sequences are identical to those found in naturally- occurring human IgG1 κ, with the light and heavy chain variable regions being identical to those originally expressed by a peripheral blood B lymphocyte that was obtained from a heal thy individual. Endogenous anti -IL-1α antibody has been reported in 5% to 28% of healthy serum or plasma samples 19,20. It has been measured in cord blood, children and adults21. The anti-IL-1α antibodies"
15,page_15,"XBIOTECH USA INC. PROTOCOL 2018- PT045 Version 3.1 CONFIDENTIAL 30 August 2018 PAGE 16 of 50 measured in human plasma have been strictly of the I gG class, particularly IgG1, IgG2, and IgG4. Relatively equal distribution is seen in male and female plasma22. Binding affinities reported for endogenous anti- IL-1α anti bodies, ranging from 4 to 16 pM. It is important to point out that affinity maturation had already taken place in the human host, and therefore no in vitro affinity maturation was required to increase the natural binding affinity of bermekimab . Also important is the fact that, unlike most other therapeutic IgG products, for which the Fc regions are derived from a rare human allele, XBiotech’s product includes a heavy chain in which the constant (CH) region represents an allele found in approximately 70% of the human population. These two features should make for a drug product with reduced potential for immunogenicity. 2.2 Drug Product ( Bermekimab 200 mg/ml) Description XBiotech’s dosage form is a sterile liquid formulation of 200 mg/mL bermekimab in a stabilizing isotonic subcutaneous formulation buffer at pH 6.2-6.5. The drug product is packaged in pre- filled syringes. The syringes used are OMPI EZ -Fill Nexa, 2.25mL 27G , ½ inch length needle, or a comparable alternative . The syringe is clear b orosilicate type 1 glass containing 2mL of the formulation and is seal ed using a West 1 -3mL Novapure piston (plunger) with Flurotec coating .

Trehalose is an effective stabilizer against oxidation, aggregation, thermal, and mechanical stress. Citrate was selected as the buffering agent due to its antioxidant properties. Extensive stability data indicates that the drug product is very stable, even under thermally and mechanically stressed conditions. Short excursions to room temperature have shown no negative effect on the product. However, the study treatment products are not to be frozen at any time. The 200 mg/ml drug product is labeled with a 12-month retest date. Every lot of 200mg/ml dosage form is also subjected to ongoing stability analysis per ICH guidelines. 2.5 METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION Patients in Groups A and B will receive 400 mg administered weekly by subcutaneous injection. Each injection should be located at least one inch from previous injection sites. * At least 45 minutes prior to injection , remove the pre- filled syringe from refrigeration Lay the syringe on a flat surface and let it naturally warm to room temperature before injection.

However, due to potential risk, it is not recommended that bermekimab be used in combination with anti - TNF agents. 2.8 PROHIBITED AND RESTRICTED THERAPIES Treatment with certain restricted concomitant medications is allowed once during study to treat acute HS exacerbation, including: • Systemic therapies with known effectiveness in HS, including corticosteroids, retinoids, or anti-androgen (hormonal) therapies. • Intralesional /topical steroids • Laser/light therapies The use of rescue medications for worsening HS is to be reported in the electronic data capture system. A second flare up of disease and subsequent use of a second rescue therapy for any patient will result in the patient being treated as a non -responder for the purpo ses of data analysis. The following concomitant therapies are prohibited for the entire duration of the trial: • Biologics that target IL -1 or TNF -alpha • Live virus vaccines • Investigational agents other than b ermekimab 3. STUDY DESIGN AND OBJECTIVES Phase 2, Open label, multicenter study of two dose cohorts of bermekimab in patients naïve to or having failed prior anti -TNF therapy with moderate to severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa . Bermekimab administered subcutaneously at a dose of 400 mg weekly ( 13 doses). Patients will be followed for 13 weeks to allow for assessment of safety and preliminary efficacy ."

CORRELATIVE STUDIES 6.1 PHARMACOKINETICS (PK) SAMPLE COLLECTION An enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed to specifically measure bermekimab levels in human plasma. Blood w ill be drawn into a single 6 ml collection tube at each PK collection time point (sample collection is pre-dose at visit 1, visit 3, visit 5, visit 9 and visit 13). These samples will be collected per the study lab manual and immediately shipped to the Sponsor for PK analysis. The PK samples will also be used to test for the presence of antibodies against bermekimab . 7. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events, vital signs, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory measurements. All subjects will be included in the safety analysis. Adverse events will be monitored from visit 1 (post -injection) through visit 14. Any serious adverse events or grade 2 or greater probably or defini tely related events will be followed up until resolution. Study drug will be administered under close observation in a facility equipped to handle anaphylaxis. Subjects must be closely monitored until at least 1 hour following the administration of the an tibody or 1 hour after their vital signs have stabilized. Any AE (with the exception of worsening HS symptoms or injection site reactions) of grade 2 or higher must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the event. Any grade 3 or greater injection site reaction must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the event. 8. STUDY VARIABLES 8.1 Demographic and Disease Characteristics Demographic characteristics will include standard demography (age, sex, race, height, weight, and BMI) medical history, medication history, and prior biologic use for each patient. Characteristics of the patients with hidradenitis suppurativa , including duration of disease, baseline disease severity scores (HiSCR, modified Sartorius score, and physician’s global assessment), baseline inflammatory lesion counts (abscesses and inflammatory nodules) , and baseline patient reported"

Baseline is defined as the visit 1 , pre-injection assessment. 8.2 Study Endpoints The primary endpoint of this study is the safety and tolerability of bermekimab at 400 mg weekly subcutaneous dose. The secondary endpoints include: • Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) score (baseline to visit 13) . For this score patients are defined as achievers or non -achievers. The positive HiSCR score is defined as a ≥ 50% reduction in inflammatory lesion AN count (sum of abscesses and inflammatory nodules), and no increase in abscesses or draining fistulas in HS compared with the lesions counted on visit 1 23. The HiSCR score , including inflammatory lesion count, will be measured on visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14. • Pharmacokinetics (P K) (baseline to visit 13) . An enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed to specifically measure bermekimab levels in human plasma. Blood w ill be drawn into a single 6 ml collection tube at each PK collection time point (sample collection is pre- dose at visit 1, visit 3, visit 5, visit 9 and visit 13). These samples will be collected per the study lab manual and immediately shipped to the Sponsor for PK analysis. The PK samples will also be used to test for the presence of antibodies against b ermekimab . • Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) (baseline to visit 13) . This is defined as: a) clear when the total number of abscesses is 0, the total number of draining fistulas is 0, the total number of inflammatory nodules is 0 and the total number of non- inflammatory nodules is 0; b) minimal when the total number of abscesses is 0, the total number of draining fistulas is 0, the total number of inflammatory nodules is 0 and there is presence of non- inflammatory nodules; c) mild when the total number of abscesses is 0, the total number of draining fistulas is 0, and the total number of inflammatory nodules is 1- 4, or when there is presence of one abscess or draining fistula and absence of any inflammatory nodules; d) moderate when the total number of abscesses is 0, the total number of draining fistulas is 0 and the total number of inflammatory nodules is at least 5; or when there is presence of one abscess or draining fistula and at least one inflammatory nodule; or when there are 2- 5 abscesses or draining fistulas and fewer than 10 inflammatory nodules; e) severe when the total number of abscesses or draining fistulas is 2-5 and the total number of inflammatory nodules is at least 10; and f) very severe when there"

The PGA will be measured on visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14. • Disease Activity Score (baseline to visit 13) . This is defined as the sum of scores of all affected areas of each patient. Each area will be evaluated by the following formula: (multiplication of the two largest diameters in each affected area in mm) x (the degree of inflammation of each lesion). This score has been proposed by our study group 25. The Disease Activity Score will be measured on visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14. • The modified Sartorius score (baseline to visit 13) . The Sartorius Scale is used to quantify the severity of HS. Points are awarded for 12 body areas (left and right axillae, left and right sub/inframammary areas, intermammary area, left and right buttocks, left and right inguino - crural folds, perianal area, perineal area, and other): points were awarded for nodules (2 points for each); abscesses (4 points); fistulas (4 points); scars (1 point); other findings (1 point); and longest distance between two lesions (2 -6 points, 0 if no lesions); and if lesions ar e separated by normal skin (yes -0 points; no- 6 points). The total Sartorius score is the sum of the 12 regional scores. The modified Sartorius score will be measured on visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14. • Change in AN count (baseline to visit 13) . The sum of abscesses and inflammatory nodules for each patient will be measured on visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14. • Change in VAS for Disease Severity and Pain (baseline to visit 13) . Patient reported visual analogue scales for pain and disease severity will be measured on visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14. • Change in Dermatology Life Quality Index ( DLQI ) (baseline to visit 13) . This will be measured on visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14. • Change in Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS ) (baseline to v isit 13) . This will be measured on visits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13 and 14. Changes in secondary endpoints will be presented by individual cohort, as well as combined across both cohorts. 9. ADVERSE EVENTS 9.1 DEFINITION OF ADVERS E EVENT (AE) An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relat ionship with the pharmaceutical or biological agent under study. An AE can therefore be any of the following:"
37,page_37,"XBIOTECH USA INC. PROTOCOL 2018- PT045 Version 3.1 CONFIDENTIAL 30 August 2018 PAGE 38 of 50 • Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including laboratory findings), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of bermekimab , whether or not it is apparently related to bermekimab ; • A concurrent illness ; • An exacerbation, or an unexpected increas e in frequency or intensity of a preexisting condition, including intermittent or episodic conditions. • A significant or unexpected worsening of the condition/indication under investigation. • A suspected interaction between the investigational drug and c oncomitant medications • Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality (including radiological interpretations, histopathological findings, et c.) 9.2 DEFINITION OF SER IOUS ADVERSE EVENT (SAE) A serious adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that meets any of the following criteria: • Results in death; • Life-threatening; • Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization; • Results in a persistent or significant disability; • An important medical event that, while it may not result in death or be immediately life - threatening or require/prolong hospitalization, may jeopardize the subject and/or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed ab ove. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization . Note that seriousness and severity should not be confused. A subject could experience a severe headache that would not qualify as an SAE, while another might experience a mild stroke that, while not severe, would be considered serious. 9.3 RECORDING OF ADVE RSE EVENTS All untoward events occurring between visit 1 and visit 14 (or if subject terminates from study prior to visit 14, seven days after the last administration of bermekimab ) on the eCRF , regardless of whether they are considered related to study drug."
38,page_38,"XBIOTECH USA INC. PROTOCOL 2018- PT045 Version 3.1 CONFIDENTIAL 30 August 2018 PAGE 39 of 50 All AEs should be recorded in a standard medical terminology as c oncisely as possible. The AE recorded should not be a procedure or a clinical/laboratory measurement but should reflect the event leading to the procedure or the cause of the clinical/laboratory abnormality, if known. Whenever possible, AEs should be evaluated and recorded as a diagnosis, rather than individual signs and symptoms. However , if a definitive diagnosis is not possible, the individual signs and symptoms should be recorded. Any AE that worsens in intensity, or becomes serious, should be recorded as a new event. 9.4 EVALUATING ADVE RSE EVENTS All AEs will be graded according to the CTCAE version 4.03. 9.5 ASSESSMENT OF CAU SALITY Investigators are required to assess the relationship, if any, of each AE or SAE to the investigational drug using clinical judgment to determine the degree of certainty with which an AE can be attributed to the investigational drug. Alternative causes, such as natural history of the underlying disease, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of the event t o the administration of the study medication must be considered. Relationship to study drug is summarized as follows: • Not Related: There is another obvious cause of the AE • Unlikely to be related: There is another more likely cause of the AE • Possibly related: The AE could have been due to the investigational drug • Probably related: The AE is probably attributable to the investigational drug • Definitely related: The AE is most likely attributable to the investigational drug 9.6 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS Any AE ( with the exception of worsening HS symptoms or injection site reactions) of grade 2 or higher must entered into the eCRF within 24 hours of learning of the event. Any grade 3 or greater injection site reaction must be reported to the sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the event. All serious adverse events (SAEs) should be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. These immediate reports should be followed promptly by detailed, written reports. The subject should be followed up with until stabilization of the reported SAE, either with full"

Before declaring the subject is lost to follow -up, three unsuccessful attempts at contact should be made and recorded on the SAE form. The immediate and follow -up reports should identify subjects by unique code numbers assigned to the trial subjects rather than by the subjects' names, personal identification numbers, and/or addr esses. The Investigator should also submit SAEs to the IRB /EC according to their IRB /EC guidelines [ICH -GCP E6]. Drug -related Serious Adverse Events will be reported to the FDA by XBiotech’s Medical Safety Officer according to 21 CFR 312.32. 9.7 REFERENCE SAFETY INFORMATION: POTENTIAL ADVERSE REACTIONS 831 patients have been treated using bermekimab in patients with advanced solid tumors, advanced hematologic malignancies, metastatic colorectal cancer, peripheral vascular disease, type II diabetes, acne vulgaris, plaque psoriasis, and pyoderma gangrenosum. Over 1200 doses of bermekimab were administered at 7.5 mg/kg to refractory, metastatic CRC patients with cancer associated symptoms at baseline (ECOG performance status 1 and 2). In this trial (PT026), which is the largest controlled trial completed with bermekimab to date (N=309), patients were dosed at 7.5 mg/kg for metastatic colorectal cancer. The most common AEs reported (>10%) were abdominal pain, peripheral edema, fatigue, anemia, constipation, decrease in weight, asthenia, decreased appetite, and nausea. The majority of these events were grade 1 or 2 and appeared to be related to the underlying CRC. The prevalence of these events was similar in the bermekimab and placebo groups. Two infusion reactions were reported in this trial, and they were not serious or severe (grade I or II). Bermekimab is a recombinant human IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for human interleukin- 1α (IL-1α). As such, it is an immunomodulator that has anti -inflammatory and anti -neoplastic properties. Other agents that could be considered in the same pharmacologic class include biologic agents that target IL -1 receptor antagonist and IL -1 beta. Potential risks for agents in this class include infusion or injection site reactions and risk of infection. Bermekimab is considered to be a True Human monoclonal antibody. Unlike previous generations of humanized or fully human antibodies, the entire bermekimab heavy and light chain sequences are identical to those found in naturally -occurring human IgG1 κ, with the light and heavy chain variable regions being identic al to those originally expressed by a peripheral blood B lymphocyte that was obtained from a healthy individual. No in vitro affinity maturation or modifications have been made to improve its natural binding affinity (211 +/ - 31 pM). We believe that a tr ue human"
40,page_40,"XBIOTECH USA INC. PROTOCOL 2018- PT045 Version 3.1 CONFIDENTIAL 30 August 2018 PAGE 41 of 50 antibody should be effectively non- immunogenic in humans and thus exhibit optimal activity and pharmacokinetics. To date, no treatment emergent anti -drug antibodies specific to b ermekimab have been identified. The mechanism behind infusion react ions is not clear in all cases. It may involve a reaction against the antibody products themselves, or, against some minor residual component from the manufacturing process (i.e. host cell proteins). To date, there has been a very low incidence of inject ion site or infusion reactions observed (20 patients out of 831 total; 2.4%). All except two of these patients had grade 1 or 2 reactions that did not result in discontinuation. In order to mitigate this class- specific risk, close monitoring is required during the bermekimab infusion and for at least 1 hour after the end of the infusion. Availability of resuscitation equipment must be ensured. Pre - medication with antihistamines or corticosteroids is not required. For the purposes of expedited safety re porting in clinical trials, the following should be considered expected events: • Infusion Related Reactions • Injection Site Reactions 10. STATISTICAL PLAN This section provides the basis for the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study. The SAP may be revised during the study to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol, and to make changes to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect planned analyses. Analysis variables are listed in Section 8. 10.1 Statist ical Hypothesis No formal hypothesis tests will be performed for the primary endpoints. 10.2 Determination of Sample Size The sample size chosen was one of convenience, and no formal sample size calculations were performed."

Safety endpoints will be evaluated by monitoring adverse events from clinical and laboratory reporting. The safety analysis will be based on the SAF population defined as all subject who received at least one dose of study medication. A summary of safety results will be presented for each treatment group. 10.5.2.1 Analysis of Adverse Events Adverse events reported in this study will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) coding dictionary (version 21.0 or newer) . Coding will be to lowest level terms. The verbatim text, the PT, and the primary SOC will be listed in patient listings. Pre-treatment AEs are defined as those that develop or worsen in severity from the time the patient provides informed consent, prior to the first dose of study drug. Treatment emergent AEs (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that develop or worsen in severity following the first dose of study drug through the last study visit. TEAEs will be grouped by MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT) within SOC and will be presented for each treatment group. The number and percent of subjects reporting at least one adverse event by PT will be summarized across groups A & B . The number and percentage of patients experiencing AEs and TEAEs will be summarized by seriousness (SAEs), severity (grades 1 -5), SOC, and PT. 10.5.2.2 Other Safety Vital Signs Summaries of vital sign parameters by treatment dose cohort will include: • Each vital sign parameter ( blood pressure, pulse, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and body temperature ) and change from baseline • The number (n) and percentage (%) of patients with grade 2 or greater vital sign AEs • Listings will be provided with flags indicating the AE grade Laboratory Tests"

PROTOCOL 2018- PT045 Version 3.1 CONFIDENTIAL 30 August 2018 PAGE 46 of 50 11.3 PROTOCOL MODIFICATIONS Modifications of the signed protocol are only possible by approved protocol amendments and with the agreement of all responsible persons. The procedure for approval of a protocol amendment is identical to that for approval of the protocol. The IRB/EC must be informed of all protocol amendments and sho uld be asked for its opinion as to whether a full re -evaluation of the ethical aspects of the study is necessary by the committee. This should be fully documented. The Investigator must not implement any deviation from or change to the protocol, without discussion with an agreement by the study Sponsor and prior review and documented approval/favorable opinion of the amendment from the relevant IRB/EC, except where it is necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects, or where the change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study (e.g., change in CRA(s), change of telephone number(s)). Protocol amendments will be submitted to the appropriate authority(ies) as required by the applicable regulatory requirement(s). 11.4 SUBJECT INFORMATION AND CONSENT The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that no subject will receive any study -related examination or activity before that subject has given an IRB/EC approved informed consent. The subject must give written consent after the receipt of detailed information. The verbal explanation will cover all the elements specified in the written information provided for the subject. The Investigator will inform the subject of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the study, including any discomfort it may entail. The subject must be given every opportunity to clarify any points he/she does not understand and if necessary, ask for more information. At the end of the interview, the subject may be given t ime to reflect if this is required, or if the subject requests more time. Subjects and/or legal guardian forms will be kept and archived by the Investigator in the Investigator's study file. It should be emphasized that the subject is at liberty to withd raw their consent to participate at any time, without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled. Subjects who refuse to give, or withdraw, written informed consent may not be included or continued in this study, but this will not impact their subsequent care. The Investigator will notify in writing each subject’s primary care physician (or equivalent) of the subject’s intent to participate in the study. 11.5 DATA PROTECTION AND CONFIDENTIALITY By signing the final protocol, every participating Investigator agrees to keep all information and results concerning the study and the investigational product confidential.
