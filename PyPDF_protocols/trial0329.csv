The study will be set in six North Carolina SNFs and in the patient’s home (during intervention periods only). Using a stepped -wedge cluster -randomized trial design, six SNFs will be randomly allocated to st andard discharge planning (control period) vs. the Connect -Home intervention (intervention period) over six sequential time - periods. Patients will be identified by consultation with SNF clinical staff and medical record review. After informed consent, baseline enrollment surveys will be collected for patients and caregivers. Additionally, a medical record review for data related to continued health outcomes will be conducted for patients. Telephone questionnaires will be used to survey patients and care givers at 7, 30, and 60 days after patients return home. Objectives: Primary Objective: 1.1: To assess patient preparedness for discharge seven days after discharge from a skilled nursing facility. 1.2: To assess caretaker preparedness for the careg iving role seven days after discharge from a skilled nursing facility. Secondary Objectives: 2.1 To assess patient quality of life 30 and 60 days after discharge from a skilled nursing facility. 2.2. To assess patient function 30 and 60 days after d ischarge from a skilled nursing facility. 2.3 To assess patient days of acute care use 30 and 60 days after discharge from a skilled nursing facility. 2.4 To assess caregiver burden 30 and 60 days after discharge from a skilled nursing facility."

Inclusion criteria for SNFs : location within 120 miles of UNC and at least 15 post -acute admissions per month . Six SNFs and six home health nurses and two alternate SNFs and two alternate home health nu rses for each SNF have agreed to participate. If a study site or a home health nurse becomes unavailable to participate, the alternate SNFs and nurses will participate in Connect -Home training. Description of Study Intervention: Connect -Home is a two -step transitional care intervention: 1) SNF staff create an individualized Transition Plan or Care and prepare the patient and caregiver to manage the patient's illness at home; and 2) within 24 hours of SNF discharge, a Connect -Home Activation RN visits the p atient's home and helps the patient and caregiver implement the written Transition Plan of Care. Both intervention steps focus on 6 key care needs to optimize patient and caregiver outcomes: 1) home safety and level of assistance; 2) advance care planning; 3) symptom management; 4) medication reconciliation; 5) function and activity; and 6) coordination of follow -up medical care. Study Duration: This study will be ongoing for four years. Participant Duration: Participants will be recruited during the SNF stay, when baseline data will be collected, and they will participate in the study for up to 60 days post -discharge."

No efficacy studies of transitional care have targeted this population, or measured whether interventions resulted in improved patient and caregiver outcomes.4 This study will test the efficacy of Connect -Home, a successfully piloted transitional care intervention, targeting both seriou sly ill SNF patients who discharge to home and their caregivers. Connect -Home will generate a new model of transitional care not dependent on research staff for delivery, thereby accelerating translation of the intervention from research to clinical practice. 2.2 BACKGROUND Annually, 1.7 -1.8 million older adults undergo episodes of care consisting of hospitalization followed by a “short stay” in a nursing home, where they use the Medicare SNF benefit for rehabilitation, medical and nursing care. 1-3 SNF patients are seriously ill: 56 -62% are ≥80 years old; 100% have recent acute illness (e.g., hip fracture, heart failure, genitourinary and pulmonary infections with & without sepsis); 28-34% are treated in intensive care during the index hospital stay; and 29 -43% have ≥1 hospitalization in the year prior to the index hospital and SNF stay.2,4-7 In addition, t hese individuals have underlying incurable chronic conditions: 29-35% are cognitively impaired; 46% have Charlson Comorbidity scores ≥2, 28% have scores ≥3; and nearly all experience multi- morbidity, for example, 82% of those with heart failure have 5 co -occurring chronic conditions.2,8-10 SNF patients also are functionally impaired and frail with an average of three or more geriatric syndromes (e.g., depressive symptoms, poor sleep, unplanned weight loss) and depend on caregivers for 3 -6 activities of daily living.6,8,11,12 Complicating these challenges, 25% of SNF patients live alone and 20 -25% are co -insured with Medicaid. After returning home, former SNF patients are at high risk for falls and functional impairment; in a recent study, 61% showed little or no functional improvement one year after SNF discharge.13-15 SNF patients are also at an exceptionally high risk for return to acute care, continued functional decline, and death. In a preliminary analysis of 55,000 SNF patient transitions to home, >5 0% of patients returned to the hospital within 90 days of discharge or died: 25.9% used ED services, 20.1% were re - hospitalized, and 8.1% died within 90 days of returning home.3 Moreover, lacking advance directives and goals of care, 33% of discharged SNF patients who died within the next month, died in hospital rather"

These seriously ill patients, as they draw closer to the end-of-life, also experience multiple transitions between healthcare providers and settings.17-19 Much evidence demonstrates that hospital -based transitional care improves patients’ preparedness for discharge and decreases the rate of re - hospitalization within 30 days of discharge.20-22 However, in a systematic review of SNF -based transitional care, no randomized clinical trials were identified and only a limited set of observational studies of transitional care were found.4 In the set of observational stud ies, there were substantial limitations, including intervention designs lacking caregiver support, advance care planning, and home follow -up after SNF discharge and serious methodological flaws (non -experimental designs with small samples and no reliable m easurement of intermediate and 30 or 60 day patient - and care -giver outcomes).4 Lacking transitional care, SNF patients (and their caregivers) are not prepared to manage the patient's serious illness at home, and are at high risk for new acute medical eve nts, diminished quality of life and other poor health outcomes.23-26 Systematic reviews of studies, describing the efficacy of transitional care interventions to prepare hospital patients for transitions to home , established that transitional care, compared to usual discharge planning, reduced the rate of re -hospitalization 30 days after patient discharge. Findings from the pilot - test of Connect- Home and systematic review of related observational studies provided foundational evidence to support the premi se that transitional care of SNF patients and their caregivers will prepare seriously ill patients for discharge, promote quality of life and function at home, and reduce hospital readmissions.27 Targeting patients with caregivers is a logical extension, b ecause they provide the direct care needed for seriously ill patients to bridge the vulnerable period following SNF discharge.28-32 2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSMENT 2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIA L RISKS Physical Risks: Patients and caregivers in control periods will receive discharge planning in the SNF, and those in intervention periods will receive transitional care in the SNF and in the patient’s home. Discharge planning and transitional care activities involve verbal assessments, conversation, education, and planning. There is a possibility that participants could be fatigued from participation in the data collection activities. For example, while participating in a care -planning meeting, a patient might feel fatigued or need to take a break. If any partic ipant has a physical injury, the study team will help them seek immediate medical attention. If a SNF patient or caregiver expresses fatigue during data collection, the data collection session will be terminated immediately, and a follow -up appointment sch eduled."

During the control and intervention periods, staff in the SNF and in the ho me health agency will engage patients and caregivers in conversations to plan strategies for managing the patient’s serious illness at home. Also, during enrollment and data collection activities, staff will assess the patients’ quality of life, functional mobility, falls at home, days at home without acute care use and caregivers’ burden and distress related to the caregiving role. Staff will also review the patient’s advance directives. These study -related activities may also involve a chance for emotio nal distress. The study team will refer distressed patients and caregivers to their attending or primary care physicians for support with emotional distress. Social Risks: During enrollment and data collection activities, study staff will collect data from participants about their health, function and quality of life; if others observed patients or caregivers participating in these activities, there is a chance that it could embarrass or distress patients or caregivers. In intervention and control periods, the study team will recruit and collect baseline data for participants in a private room. When necessary, this data may also be obtained virtually when research personnel are not able to encounter face to face interactions with study participants. When these occasions arise, all virtual interactions will be conducted at a time when the patient is alone and not able to be overheard. Study team will conduct these in private settings as well ensuring that no questions an d/or responses will be overheard. During telephone calls to collect outcome data, the identity of patients will be confirmed. All research staff will be trained by the PI and other study team members to collect data with the utmost respect and sensitivity to support participants and help them feel comfortable during data collection activities. The research team members will remind participants that participation in the study is voluntary, and that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any tim e if they are not comfortable. The team will assure patients and caregivers that withdrawal from the study will not have an impact on their medical care. Risk of Loss of Confidentiality: During enrollment and data collection activities, staff will o btain health information about patients and caregivers. Thus, a potential risk to SNF patients and caregivers is loss of confidentiality. All research study personnel will be trained in IRB and HIPAA guidelines to maintain the security and confidentia lity of the data. During the consenting process, the study team will explain the"
13,page_13,"Connect -Home: Testing the Efficacy of Transitional Care of Patients and Caregivers during Transitions from Skilled Nursing Facilities to Home Version 2.0 Protocol 13 July 2020 Connect -Home Protocol v 2.0 13Jul2020 13 confidentiality protections and will inform the participants of their right to skip items, pause during participation, and withdraw from the study at any time. When face to f ace interaction is not feasible, study discussion s will occur in a virtual manner. In order to avoid a loss of confidentiality, these interactions will be conducted in a private area where the discussions will not be overheard. Risks for loss of confidentiality will be minimal secondary to use of procedures to protect confidentiality, including (a) using study codes on data documents and keeping a separate document that links the study code to subjects’ identifying information locked in a separate loca tion and restrict access to this document to certain members of the study team; (b) de- identification of data to remove the possibility that data could be connected to individuals that consented to participate in the study; (c) encrypting identifiable data ; and (d) securely storing data documents within locked locations. All identifying information will be destroyed at the earliest possible time following completion of the study. In addition, data will be reported in aggregate form, without identifying in formation by site or individual. Publications arising from the study will not contain personal information. All SNF patients or caregiver participants will continue to receive routine medical care from their health care providers throughout the study. 2.3.2 KNOWN POTENTIA L BENEFITS The major potential benefit of this study is new knowledge about ways to improve outcomes for seriously ill SNF patients and/or their caregivers. The intervention patients will receive valuable information, training and plans about their diagnosis, indicators of emerging medical problems, medications, treatments, advance care directives, follow- up appointments and studies, home care services, questions to ask their community physicians, strategies to avoid falls at home, self -care at home in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic (when applicable) , and discrepancies in their home medications that should be addressed with community or SNF physicians. Their family caregivers will also receive this information and training as well as training to support the patient and strategies to relieve stress and hardship related to the caregiver role. Participants in the control periods in the SNFs will receive usual discharge planning. As a result of the research, we will know whether and to what degree the intervention, compared to usual care, increased the capacity of SNF patients to achieve health care goals at home after SNF discharge and caregivers to avoid burden and distress related to the caregiving role. If the intervention is successful, this study will provide an evidence -based practice rationale for intervention with seriously ill SNF patients or their caregivers. It will also provide new knowledge related to care of adults with serious illness in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic."

Randomization will be conducted for all sites simultaneously by a study statistician blinded to SNF identity. The randomized allocation sequence of the SNF will determine the beginning and end dates for thre e phases of patient and caregiver enrollment: (1) standard care, (2) the pre -implementation phase when staff are trained and neither patients nor caregivers are enrolled, and (3) the implementation phase when newly enrolled patients and their caregivers re ceive Connect- Home. Patients and caregivers will be enrolled on a rolling basis at the rate of 4 -5 dyads per month anytime during the control or intervention period. There will be three phases of patient and caregiver enrollment: (1) standard of care (indicated by blue boxes in Figure 2), (2) the pre -implementation phase when staff are trained and neit her patients nor caregivers are enrolled (indicated by orange boxes in Figure 2), and (3) the implementation phase when newly enrolled patients and their caregivers receive the Connect -Home intervention (indicated by green boxes in Figure 2). The pri mary objectives will be assessed 7 days after discharge. The secondary and exploratory outcomes will be assessed 30 and 60 days after discharge."

Observing SNF's under standard practice followed by the Connect -Home intervention is also consistent with the actual practice of implementing organizational change in SNFs and provides opportunities for evaluating implementation procedures. Cluster randomization at the nursing home level reduces risk of contamination between control and Conne ct-Home participants (Figure 2). 4.3 END OF STUDY DEF INITION The end of study will be when the study team completes the final enrolled participant's 60- day assessments, and all data (including the final home health care chart reviews) have been collected from all study subjects. If a subject is withdrawn from the study due to an early termination caused by hospitalization, SNF re -admission and/or death; end of study for these patients will occur on day of early termination."

No additional data will be collected from the time of screen failure, but data collected prior to screen failure and reason for screen failure will be kept. 5.4 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETEN TION Recruitment: The study team will obtain a limited waiver of HIPAA authorization to allow pre -screening for patient eligibility. The team will consult at least weekly with the Minimum Data Set Nurse, social worker, or other personnel involved in coordinating clinical care for newly admitted patients in each SNF by phone, email, or in -person to identify patients that are expected to be discharged from the SNF to home, and subsequently screen the medical records of all patients expected to discharge from the SNF to home. After identifying potentially e ligible patients, the study team will recruit SNF patients and their caregivers in -person (or, when risk mitigation related to COVID -19 prevents in -person contact, we will recruit virtually , using an iPad and connection via ZOOM) within 10 days of their admission and will review the patient's medical record to confirm eligibility. For patients with cognitive impairment, the team will recruit the patient's legally authorized representative to respond to survey questions as the patient's proxy. Recruitment will be conducted in the SNFs through in -person interactions (or, when risk mitigation related to COVID -19 prevents in -person contact , we will recruit virtually , using an iPad and connection via ZOOM) . If necessary, recruitment can also be conducted by telephone for caregivers. All participants will provide written informed consent ( or, when risk mitigation related to COVID -19 prevents in -person contact , we will obtain consent verbally using an iPad an d connection via ZOOM) for study participation . When written consent is not feasible, we will obtain witnessed verbal consent with the assistance of nursing home personnel via the iPad and Zoom connection). L egally authorized representatives will give consent for patients with cognitive impairment. Consent and HIPAA Authorization could also be obtained verbally in the situation that a participant is unable to physically sign these documents. Retention: During recruitment, study personnel will give the patient and caregiver a study flyer providing the study team's contact information, a schedule of planned follow -up calls, and information regarding compensation for completing data collection. When study personnel is unable to provide these study flyers directly to the patient, the study team will provide flyers to NH staff to announce the study and the possibility that a study team member will speak with potential study participants in -person or"

The randomized allocation sequence of the SNF will determine the beginning and end dates for three phases of patient and caregiver enrollment: (1) standard of care, (2) the pre -implementation phase when staff are trained and neither patients nor caregivers are enrolled, and (3) the implementation phase when newly enrolled patients and their caregivers receive the Connect- Home intervention. Blinding Professional data collectors from the Carolina Survey Research Lab (CSRL) will collect data from patients and caregivers at 7, 30, and 60 days post -discharge. These data collectors will be blinded to both the study hypothesis and to treatment group assignment. 6.3 STUDY INTERVENTI ON COMPLIAN CE The NIH Behavior Change Consortium’s “Treatment Fidelity Protocols” will be used to ensure fidelity to the intervention.46 Fidelity will be assessed in five domains as described below. Design: The researchers will use standardized tools (e.g., Connect- Home Toolkit, the EHR template and staff training protocols) to deliver the intervention. Training: T o prevent contamination between SNFs during the intervention phase, the researcher will train staff in individual SNFs and Connect -Home Activation RNs i n individual home health care offices. A detailed training protocol will be used, specifying the researcher roles, content, participants, and time required for training activities. Delivery: A researcher will observe staff training activities on a random schedule to assess fidelity of the trainer to the staff training protocols. The research team will develop plans to address deviations from the training protocol. A Training Contact Database will be used, in which researchers will record staff participation in training activities. Staff members will be assigned identification numbers for tracking participation. Receipt of Treatment: Researchers will administer post -tests to all participating staff after the staff training session; additional one -to-one r e-training will be provided as needed for those who score"

Researchers will also use return demonstration of home visit procedures with Connect -Home Activation RNs, followed by re -training as needed until nurses demonstrate a high level of ability. Enactment of Skills: The study team will audit medical records for intervention patients to assess fidelity to the study protocol. Protocol elements to be assessed will include the following: a) completing the Transition Plan of Care; b) convening care p lan meetings; c) reviewing advance directives in the SNF; d) scheduling follow -up medical appointments; e) transmitting records to follow -up clinicians; g) completing home visits within 24 hours after dis -charge; h) reconciling medications in the patient’s home; i) completing the home safety evaluation; and j) communicating patient status to the on -coming home health nurse. As part of enactment monitoring, the Connect -Home Activation RN will keep a log describing medication discrepancies and the patients re ferred for a rehabilitation therapy after discharge home. Further, the researcher will host at least one 30 -minute monthly meeting, during the intervention phase in each SNF, to relay feedback and discuss findings from fidelity monitoring with SNF staff an d the Connect -Home Activation RN. Finally, a researcher will observe 10% of staff as they deliver Connect -Home and, using a standard checklist, the researcher will provide feedback about enactment of the Connect -Home protocols. If in-person observations ar e not possible (owing to risk mitigation related to COVID -19), we will monitor enactment fidelity via Zoom -based observations of care plan meetings and/ or day of discharge teaching sessions.

Evaluate the efficacy of Connect -Home to improve SNF patient and caregiver preparedness for care at home. a. Hypothesis 1a: Compared to patients enrolled in control periods, Connect -Home patients will experience greater preparedness for discharge (primary outcome, measured with the CTM -15), assessed 7 days after discharge home b. Hypothesis 1b: Compared to caregivers of patients enrolled in control periods, Connect -Home caregivers will experience greater preparedness for caregiving (primary outcome, measured with the Preparedness for Caregiving Scale), assessed 7 days after discharge home. 2. Evaluate the efficacy of Connect -Home to improve SNF patient and caregiver outcomes after discharge home. a. Hypothesis 2a: Compared to patients enrolled in control periods, Connect -Home patients will experience better quality of life and function (secondary outcomes), and fewer falls requiring medical assistance (exploratory), measured 30 and 60 days after discharge home b. Hypothesis 2b: Compared to caregivers from control periods, Connect -Home caregivers will experience less burden and caregiver distress (secondary outcomes), measured 30 and 60 days after discharge home 3. Evaluate the efficacy of Connect -Home to prevent acute care use up to 60 days after SNF discharge. a. Hypothesis 3a: Compared to patients enrolled in control periods, Connect -Home patients will have fewer days of acute care use (composite of emergency department and hospital use) (secondary outcome) and more hospice enrollm ent (exploratory), measured 30 and 60 days after discharge home 9.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETE RMINATION Computer simulations were used to calculate statistical power for comparing control (standard discharge procedures) and intervention (Connect -Home) conditions fo r primary outcomes and selected secondary outcomes. For each scenario, 1000 simulated datasets were generated with outcomes clustered within SNFs for the stepped -wedge design in Figure 2 and the respective linear mixed models (Log CTM -15, Preparedness for Caregiving Scale, MQo L-R, Life Space Assessment, Zarit Caregiver Burden scale) and MZIP random intercept model (Days of acute care use). Based on preliminary data for Aim 1, we assumed that the group difference in log CTM -15 scores was θ=0.15. We also assumed that responses fr om patients within the same SNF in the same period would have an intra -cluster correlation of 0.10 (ICC W). We assumed that responses from patients or caregivers in the same site but from different periods would have an intra- cluster correlation of 0.05 (I CCB); together with the total variance of the outcome (SD2), these values determine and in the linear mixed models of Aims 1 and 2. Under these assumptions and accounting for 23% dropouts, 277 patients at 7 days post -discharge will provide 89% power to d etect an increase of 0.15 in the mean log CTM -15 score (equivalent to a 16% increase in"

Power for Caregiver Preparedness is similarly determined. Power for secondary outcomes at 30 days post -discharge assumes a 30% dropout rate. For the control group in Aim 3, we assumed a prevalence of 22% of patients having at least one day of acute care use and, among those patients, a tr uncated -at-zero mean of 4.0 days. These assumptions imply that the overall mean number of acute care use days is 0.881 and the excess zero probability is 0.776. For the intervention group, we assumed an overall mean acute care use days of 1.8 and excess ze ro probability 0.685. Thus, assuming 30% dropout and (optimistically) zero intraclass correlation within SNFs, the MZIP model for independent outcomes has 82% power (not shown); however, the MZIP model with empirical standard errors adjusting for possible clustering within SNFs has 71% power. If there is positive intraclass correlation, power will be lower. However, for days of acute -care use within 60 days of discharge, power is higher than for 30 days due to higher prevalence and mean number of days of ac ute care use. 9.3 POPULATIONS FOR ANALYSES An intent to treat analysis will be used in which all patients/caregivers are included in the analysis according to their treatment allocation at enrollment, regardless of whether they receive the full interventi on. 9.4 STATISTICAL ANAL YSES 9.4.1 GENERAL APPROA CH Descriptive statistics will be used for all variables. If patients or caregivers with missing covariates are few (< 5%), unconditional mean imputations will be used to impute missing values for continuous covariates and unconditional mode imputation for ca tegorical covariates. If 5% -15% of patients or caregivers have missing covariates, conditional mean imputation will be used. If missing covariate data exceed 15%, multiple imputation will be used. Missing outcomes will not be imputed. For continuous variab les that are highly skewed, the statistical team will log -transform the data for analysis. All statistical tests will be two -tailed with 0.05 significance levels. Also, descriptive statistics will be used to describe intervention fidelity (receipt, deliver y and enactment). Finally, in the absence of strong temporal effects, balance in covariates is expected between control and intervention patients; supplemental analyses will involve assessing the impact of the covariates (i.e., insurance provider, SNF length of stay, race, gender, and others determined with bivariate analyses) on outcomes in the statistical models for aims 1 -3. Finally, to determine the extent the intervention effect can be attributed to home health care use, a general multilevel approach will be used to causal mediation analysis to evaluate home health care use as a mediator for intervention effect on outcomes as a secondary analysis. This approach uses two"

Outputs include indirect and direct effects of the intervention. 9.4.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFI CACY ENDPOINT(S) In the models for patient preparedness for discharge (CTM -15 score), data will be included that was provided by the patient or by caregiver (for patients that are not able to answer survey questions). We will use hier archical linear models (HLM) to compare observations between intervention and usual care periods for CTM -15 score at seven days post -discharge. Linear mixed models or HLM allow for different numbers of patients per site, while accounting for correlated res ponses between patients within the same SNF. Let Y ijk denote the CTM -15 score for patient k in SNF i and period (enrollment month) j; (i = 1, 6; j = 1, …, 22). The basic HLM is, where is an intercept term, is a random effect for SNF, accounts for a potenti al linear temporal trend, is a random effect for period j nested within SNF i, is an indicator for the treatment condition (i.e., 1 if Connect- Home; 0 is standard discharge procedures), θ is the treatment effect, and is an error term. Furthermore, we ass ume a variance components structure such that all random effects are independent with, and where subscripts “c”, “p” and “e” denote cluster (i.e., SNF), period and error variance components, respectively. The correlation structure induced by these random effects allows the within -SNF correlation of outcomes from two patients enrolled in the same month (ICC W) to be different from the within -SNF correlation of outcomes from patients enrolled in different months (ICC B). Specifically, by denoting the total variance, the intraclass correlations are ICC W =, and ICC B =. For CTM -15, the basic HLM model will be amended by including additional explanatory variables as fixed effects: CTM -15 score source (patient or caregiver), patient age, gender and race. Due to skew ness of the CTM -15 score distribution found in our preliminary data, we expect this outcome will be log - transformed prior to analysis. The group difference in log CTM -15 scores (intervention vs. control) across the study periods will be estimated along wit h a 95% confidence interval. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted to assess whether the effect of Connect- Home depends on the number of months that an SNF has been operating under the Connect -Home protocol. This is achieved by extending the HLM so that separate effects of Connect- Home are estimated when the Connect- Home protocol has been implemented for ≤ 3 months versus > 3 months in order to examine whether the impact of Connect- Home is sustained three months following its initial implementation in th e staff training period. A similar linear mixed model will be applied for the Preparedness for Caregiving outcome, except that respondent source is not included. 9.4.3 ANALYSIS OF TH E SECONDARY ENDPOINT (S) In Aim 2, linear mixed models will be used that are extensions of those in the Aim 1 analysis for the analysis of quality of life (MQoL -R), patient function (Life Space Assessment), patient falls (exploratory outcome), caregiver burden (Zarit scale) and distress (Distress Thermometer). The statistical team will augment the basic HLM in the Aim 1 analysis with a random effect for patients and additional fixed effects for visit and treatment by visit interactions to model the day 30 and 60 outcomes simultaneously"

A statistically sign ificant visit by treatment condition interaction would indicate that the impact of Connect -Home varies according to elapsed days since discharge. Because the main interest is in day 30 and 60 outcomes, differential treatment effects will be examined at these two time points and, if differences exist, estimate the effect of the Connect- Home intervention and its 95% confidence at each time point. In hypothesis 2b, separate Poisson mixed models will be used with log link for each post -discharge time point in t he assessment of the intervention effect on falls with a similar structure for fixed and random effects as described in the Aim 1 analysis. Therefore, instead of modeling the repeated outcomes as the number of falls between day 0 -30 and between days 31 -60, respectively, the statistical team will separately model the cumulative number of falls by day 30 and 60, respectively, to assess whether the Connect- Home intervention reduces the cumulative fall rates post - discharge at these two time points. We will esti mate the incident rate ratio and its 95% confidence interval. The main outcome for Aim 2.3, the number of cumulative days of acute care use, (i.e., days due to re - hospitalizations and emergency department visits), will be modeled using separate marginalized zero - inflated Poisson (MZIP) models with log link. The statistical team will test and estimate the overall effect of Connect -Home relative to standard discharge procedures through exponentiation of the treatment regression coefficient for the overall m ean as an incidence rate ratio (IRR) and its 95% confidence interval, basing these on empirical standard errors to allow for possible intraclass correlation within SNFs. MZIP was chosen over the standard ZIP model because although a large number of zero co unts (event outcomes) are anticipated, the overall exposure effect of Connect- Home is of interest, and not its effect on an unobserved subpopulation (i.e., latent class). Separate time point -specific generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with logit link will be used for the binary outcome of whether a resident visited the ED within 30 or 60 days of discharge, respectively, from the SNF. This model type is an extension of ordinary logistic regression that includes random intercepts and period effects for S NFs to account for the within SNF correlation induced by the stepped -wedge design. A similar GLMM will be applied to compare the proportion of hospice referrals between standard discharge procedures and Connect - Home. When events are sparse, SNFs will be tr eated as fixed effects to mitigate model non - convergence problems. 9.4.4 BASELINE DESCR IPTIVE STATISTICS Co-variate data will be collected about patients in person and from the medical record.
