Physical activity is an effective method to improv e physical function and regain muscle performance; however, no effective approach has been routinely implemented that can improve physical function in sarcoma survivors. This study seeks to assess the feasibility of implementing a resistance training exercise regimen as a means to improve physical function in individual sarcoma survivors. In this study, eligible participants will be assigned a series of progressive training exercises that are to be performed biweekly for a total of 12 weeks. Each week, one training sessions will be performed independently by the participant, whereas the other will be monitored by a certified exercise physiologist in a videoconference with the participant. Video conferences may be in groups of 1- 3 participants, depending on the preferences of the participant for 1:1 or a small group session. This “tele- exercise” approach allows the exercise physiologist to supervise exercise and adjust training programs to optimize safety and efficacy but reduces the patient burden by allowing the participant to exercise at home, which we expect will result in greater program adherence and study retention. Primary Objective The primary objective of this trial is to assess the feasibility of an individualized resistance training program in sarcoma survivors. Secondary Objective 1. To asses s secondary measures of feasibility of a home -based, individualized PRT program in sarcoma survivors 2. To determine if a 3-month resistance training program improves physical function in sarcoma survivors. Exploratory Objective To determine if a 3 -month resistance training program improves body composition and bone mineral density in sarcoma survivors. Primary Endpoint s The primary endpoint of feasibility will be measured by 3- month retention rate, exercise adherence rate and frequency of related serious adverse event ."

BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND SCIENTIFIC RA TIONALE 1.1 EFFECTS OF EXERCISE ON POST -TREATMENT CA NCER PATIENTS While advancements in therapeutics continue to improve patient survivorship , the effects of treatment are not without adverse psychological and physical side effects, which can negatively impact quality of life.1 Physical side effects experienced by cancer patients post-treatment include fatigue, decreased muscle strength and lean body mass, reduced bone mass, as well as diminished aerobic capacity.2,3 Moreover, low skeletal muscle mass (i.e., sarcopenia) is shown to be an independent poor prognostic factor for survival among patients with various cancers .4-6 Routine exercise, such as aerobic or progressive resistance training, allows for improving a patient’s health status and counter these adverse side effects by increasing cardiopulmonary function, muscle strength, bone mineral density, while reducing body weight, fat mass, and fatigue. 7-9 Particularly, progressive resistance training appears to be most effective at counteracting muscle wasting.7,8 1.2 PROGRESSIVE RESISTAN CE TRAINING There is a strong association between lean body mass, muscle strength, and the ability to adequately perform functional measures of activities of daily living (e.g., chair rising, stair climbing). 10,11 Not surprisingly, sarcopenia following anticancer therapy often leaves cancer patients with diminished lean body mass, as well as decreasing muscle strength that together negatively impact the functional performance and independent lifestyle. Progressive resistance training ( PRT) is particularly efficacious for adult and elderly cohorts given its efficacy in counteracting sarcopenia, abating osteoporosis , and reversing many physiological and functional impairments that accrue with age. 12 The goal of PRT is to enhanc e the ability of muscles to generate force by using repetitive loads (i.e., training intensity) . 13 In general , PRT involves challenging the skeletal muscles with some form of resistance (e.g., exercise machines, free weights, and elastic bands) that are lifted repetitively (~8–15 repetitions maximum [RM] per set ) to the point of neuromuscular fatigue.13 Optimal PRT sessions typical include a 48 to 72 hour recovery period that allows for physiological super -compensation (i.e. , positive adaptation). Subsequent PRT sessions involve the incremental increase in the training intensity (i.e. load) and training volume (i.e. number of sets), as well as alterations/adjustments to the types of exercises, as well as time under tension for each repetition. 13 1.3 SARCOMA AND POST -TREATMENT EXERCISE Sarcomas are a collection of connective tissue cancers that make up nearly 20% of pediatric and ~1% of adult malignancies. 14,15 Sarcomas most often arise from bone, muscle or fat in the extremities. Treatment requires surgery at a minimum, and although current surgical approaches usually avoid amputation, surgery to remove a sarcoma of the extremity or limb girdle profoundly influences physical function. Additionally, sarcoma treatment frequently includes radiation and intense, multi -agent chemotherapy.16-18 Implementing a regimen of physical activity in patients with sarcoma is important to regaining muscle performance and enhancing recovery. 19 Muller et al20 prospectively evaluated the impact of physical activity among pediatric cancer patients following a 4- week rehabilitation program consisting of land- based and aquatic exercises. Among the 150 study participants, 26 patients were part of the sarcoma cohort . The authors observed that following a 6-month period post-rehabilitation, patients exhibited a significant increase in physical activity volume and"
12,page_12,"Improving Physical Function in Sarcoma Survivors Protocol number: eIRB# 19942 Version # 4.0 16 APR 2020 PI: Lara Davis, MD 13 cadence. Moreover , at the 12- month follow -up, participants in the sarcoma cohort showed a significant imp rovement in endurance compared to baseline. In an open non- randomized clinical trial, Winter et al21 examined 31 pediatric patients with malignant bone tumors (22 osteosarcoma, 10 Ewing’s sarcoma). All patients had received an endoprosthetic replacement and were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and /or radiotherapy. Fifteen patients were assigned to the control group, which received symptom -specific physiotherapy. The other 16 patients were assigned to receive symptom -specific physiotherapy plus exercise intervention consisting of different exercises (i.e., strength, endurance, coordination, and flexibility exercises). The authors observed that following an 18- month follow - up, the volume and time spent in moderately intense activity was increased in both control and exercise groups, which was attributed to general recovery. Although not significant, patients in the exercise interventional group demonstrated a greater volume of physical activity compared to those in the control group. 1.4 RATIONALE While essential for survival, treatment of sarcoma may lead to serious long- term health consequences, including decreased physical functioning 22-25. Reduced joint range of motion, decreased muscle strength, lymphedema and marked deconditioning are frequent after completion of sarcoma therapy. Safe and adequate physical functioning requires dexterity, agility, flexibility, mobility and muscular strength, all of which are essential to performing independent activities of daily living and avoiding accidental injuries, such as falls. Reduced physical function leads to decreased overall physical activity, which in turn can contribute to the development of obesity, poor bone health, depression, and increased risk of falls or fracture that all can increase health care costs. Despite the high risk for reduced physical functioning post -treatment, no strategies for improving physical function have been developed for sarcoma survivors and clinical guidelines are bereft of recommendations to manage functional consequences of treatment. Exercise has been shown to offer symptomatic relief from side effects of cancer treatment and improve quality of life among cancer survivors 26, but the potential benefits of exercise to improve physical functioning in sarcoma survivors are unknown. This study seeks to investigate feasibility of implementing functional resistance training for sarcoma survivors as means to improve their physical function. 1.5 POTENTIAL RISKS AND BENEFITS 1.5.1 KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS Exercise and functional physical testing performed in this study can cause transient muscle soreness that typically resolves within 3 days. Participants may experience fatigue/tiredness related to exercise regimen. Participants are at possible, though slight, risk of injury from exercises; however, the exercise regimen will be taught to participants by a certified exercise physiologist ( EP) that will guide and instruct participants on appropriate body mechanics to prevent or reduce risk of injury. Moreover, no significant injuries as a result of similar exercise regimens have been reported. 27 This study involves the implementation of several survey tools to be administered to participants throughout the trial. Participants may be anxious about their ability to read surveys. T o"
13,page_13,"Improving Physical Function in Sarcoma Survivors Protocol number: eIRB# 19942 Version # 4.0 16 APR 2020 PI: Lara Davis, MD 14 minimize any undue stress, the study team will offer the option to have the survey questions verbally read (in person or over the telephone) to these individuals and help fill out the sur vey. If participants express anxiety regarding the ability to complete any of the physical tests (e.g., PPB, 1RM, grip strength) they will be given the option of discontinuing the test. At baseline, participants will undergo imaging for total body fat mass, fat free or lean mass in kilograms, as well as bone mineral density for two clinically relevant sites (proximal femur and lumbar spine) to be determined by dual energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic -QDR Discovery Wi; APEX software , v.4.02) scan. At follow -up, participants will undergo imaging for total body mass, fat free or lean mass in kilograms, to be determined by dual energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic -QDR Discovery Wi; APEX software, v.4.02) scan. These scans include exposure to low -dose ionizing radiation. Participants may refuse DXA and remain eligible for the study. No pregnant women will undergo DXA and all women of childbearing potential will undergo urine pregnancy testing prior to DXA scan to minimize fetal risk . During periods of hospital recommendations for decreased in- person contact, imaging will be omitted. During virtual sessions, additional safety precautions will include: 1) Providing safety recommendations specific to exercises and/or assessments (i.e., standing near a wall for balance activities) 2) Adapting the exercise protocol as necessary (ie. limit weight.) 3) Verifying address of remote exercise location (i.e., home address), should the study staff require the need to call 911 in an emergency 4) Ensuring that emergency contact information is up- to-date and readily available. 1.5.2 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENE FITS An exercise regimen may improve physical function in sarcoma survivors. It cannot, however, be guaranteed that participants in this study will directly benefit from the intervention during study participation, as the clinical trial is designed to provide information about the safety and feasibility of this interventional approach. Participants will receive the results of their DXA scans. No compensation will be provided to participants for their involvement in this study. If participants are provided with resistance bands, handheld weights or weighted vests, they will be permitted to keep this equipment after successful completion of end- of-study assessments. 2.

Additional baseline standardized s elf-reported evaluations include: Patient - Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) cancer -specific physical function assessment, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), Godin Leisure- Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy: Fatigue (FACT -F) scale . Physical assessments will be completed by a qualified exercise physiologist (EP) and include: 1-repitition maximum (1RM) test, short physical performance battery (PPB), grip strength test, and assessments of mobility using wearable sensor s (postural sway (ISway), timed up and go (iTUG) and 6- minute walk test (6MWT)) . The EP will integrate results from baseline objective physical function assessments with patient - reported and physician- recommended limitations , and prescribe an individualized therapeutic resistance exercise plan. Each participant will undergo a one-time, in -person session with the EP, in which they will be provided a written exercise plan and receive training on how to perform the therapeutic resistance exercises at home. All subsequent exercise sessions will be conducted at home. During periods of hospital recommendations for decreased in- person contact, participants will perform all exercise sessions remotely (e.g., at home) using videoconfer encing software. Specifically, participants are expected to complete a total of 24 exercise sessions over a 12-week period (i.e., 2 exercise training sessions per week for 12 weeks) , with at least 1 full day of rest between each session (i.e., approximately 48 hours 11.

One home- based training session per week will be conducted via video- conferencing with the EP remotely supervising the participant. Training sessions may occur with up to three participants at a time, to improve efficiency of training and create peer support; however, if a participant does not want to or cannot be in a group, training will be delivered 1:1. The resistance training program utilized in this study is based on guidelines from the American College of Sports Medici ne (ACSM).27-32 The resistance exercise program will consist of upper and lower body exercises and may use free weights (i.e., dumbbells), weighted vests, and /or resistance bands. The resistance exercises employed in this study are common to activities of daily living and have been previously described.27,30 Following the baseline assessment , the EP trainer will individualize the participant’s training program; additional modifications to the exercise program may be introduced during video sessio ns as necessary based on the participant ’s physical limitations . After completing the 12- week PRT program, pa rticipants will return to clinic for an end of study visit to evaluate physical function in relation to baseline performance. A total of 10 sarcoma survivors will be recruited for participation in this study. The total study duration for each participant is approximately 3 months, including the resistance training intervention and follow - up. 4.

STUDY PROCEDURES/EVA LUATIONS AND SCHEDUL E 5.1 STUDY SPECIFIC PROCE DURES 5.1.1 DEMOGRAPHICS Demographic variables, including race, ethnicity, education, marital status, employment, income, and (for females) childbearing potential will be measured at baseline by a questionnaire developed for this study. Health history and sarcoma- specific information (e.g., diagnosis, type and dates of cancer treatments, presence of other chronic conditions ) will be obtained from participants’ electronic health record. All subjects will also be offered participat ion in the Sarcoma Survivorship Registry [IRB #12039]. 5.1.2 PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS At baseline, each participant will complete a free text self -report of physical limitations. In addition, the treating physician will provide a written report identifying specific physical limitations and recommended modifications to physical activity. 5.1.3 ADVERSE EVENT EVALUA TION Adverse events will be monitored from the time the participant signs the Consent Form. Participants will be instructed to report all AEs during the study and will be assessed for the occurrence of AEs bi-weekly throughout the study by an in- house survey. All AEs (serious and non-serious) must be recorded on the source documents and CRFs regardless of the assumption of a causal relationship with the study intervention."
19,page_19,"Improving Physical Function in Sarcoma Survivors Protocol number: eIRB# 19942 Version # 4.0 16 APR 2020 PI: Lara Davis, MD 20 For details on AE collection and reporting, refer to Section 8. 5.1.4 SELF-REPORTED ADHERE NCE TO ASSIGNED EXER CISE REGIMEN For home- based sessions, participants are required to maintain a training log to assess adherence to the assigned intervention. Partici pants will be provided with a training log and are required to record the date, time, and duration of the exercise session, along with description of the exercise including intensity, number of repetitions, and number of sets. 5.1.5 SELF-REPORTED OUTCOM E MEASURES All self -reported assessments will primarily be administered electronically as an online survey, but may be administered on paper if requested by the participant. Study participants will complete each survey at baseline and at end of study visit . 5.1.5.1 Godin Leisure- Time Exercise Questionnaire The Godin Leisure- Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ)33 is a brief four -item query of usual leisure -time exercise habits. In this s elf-explanatory questionnaire, the study participant will be asked to respond to the question “During a typical 7 -Day period (a week), how many times on the average do you do the following kinds of exercise for more than 15 minutes during your free time?” . The participants’ responses will consist of entering the frequency of which the activity is performed in relation to its intensity (i.e., strenuous, moderate, or mild exercise). 5.1.5.2 PROMIS -Cancer -Physical Function Measure The PROMIS -Cancer assessment 34 consists of 45 questions pertaining to physical function, each of which are designed as having five- point ordinal rating scales. 5.1.5.3 36-Item Short Form Survey The 36- Item Short Form Health Survey (SF -36) consists of a set of generic, quality -of-life measures to survey physical function in the general population. 35 5.1.5.4 FACT -F The 13- item Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy -Fatigue 36 (FACT -F) measurement system will be used to assess fatigue. 5.1.6 PHYSICAL FUNCTION AS SESSMENTS During testing visits, if a participant experiences self -reported tiredness, or the participant’s tiredness is observed by the EP (during 1:1 sessions), then they may be instructed to halt their participation in the physical function assessments, and begin again at a later time. Participants may rest a s often as needed during the physical function assessments if tiredness occurs. 5.1.6.1 Short Physical Performance Battery (PPB) The short PPB will be conducted as previously described 37, and consists of 3 timed performance tests: 1) 5 repeated chair stands, b) standing balance (semi -tandem stand; side- by side stand; tandem stand), and c) gait speed over 4 meters."
20,page_20,"Improving Physical Function in Sarcoma Survivors Protocol number: eIRB# 19942 Version # 4.0 16 APR 2020 PI: Lara Davis, MD 21 5.1.6.2 One-repetition maximum ( 1RM ) Strength Testing Maximal strength of the upper and lower body w ill be evaluated by a 1RM l eg press and bench press (kg) according to established protocols.30 5.1.6.3 Grip Strength Participant grip strength will be evaluated using a Lafayette Instruments using Hand Dynamometer Model 78010 (or equivalent device). 5.1.6.4 Gait and Balance Postural stability and gait will be measured using standard and instrumented (i.e., wearable sensors ) assessments. Participants will be fitted with elastic body straps designed to hold a number of wearable body sensors (iMobility, APDM, Inc.) . Each wearable sensor weighs <25 grams (with battery), and houses an accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer. Study participants will be asked to conduct a 6- minute walk test (6MWT) , a postural sway test, and the timed- up-and-GO (TUG) test. Each test will be conducted while wearing the iMobility sensors. For the 6MWT, each participant will walk as far as possible for 6 minutes along a defined walking course (e.g., hallway or corridor). Participants will be instructed to walk and not to run or jog. Postural way will be assessed during 30- seconds of quiet standing . 38 TUG will be evaluated by assessing measuring the time that it takes an individual to rise from a chair, walk 7 meters, turn around and return to the chair in a seated position. 39 5.1.7 BODY COMPOSITION AND BONE MINERAL DENSIT Y Total body fat mass, fat free or lean mass in kilograms, as well as bone mineral density for two clinically relevant sites (proximal femur and lumbar spine) will be determined by dual energy x - ray absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic -QDR Discovery Wi; APEX software, v.4.02) scan. The DXA scan will be performed by trained research staff. Individual participant’s height as well as weight using a physician scale, will also be recorded at time of each DXA scanning visit. Participants may refuse DXA and remain eligible for the study. 5.2 LABORATOR Y PROCEDURES AND EVALUATIONS For women of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be checked prior to DXA scan. Women are considered of non- childbearing potential if they have had at least 12 months of amenorrhea at an age that is appropriate for menopause, or if they have had bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks prior. No other laboratory procedures are required as part of this study and should be performed only as clinically indicated. Results of any hematological (e.g., complete blood count [CBC]) or biochemical (e.g., complete metabolic panel [CMP]) laboratory testing performed as part of institutional standard of care practice may be recorded in appropriate CRF for the duration that an individual is participating in this study. 5.3 SCREENING ASSESSMENT S"
21,page_21,"Improving Physical Function in Sarcoma Survivors Protocol number: eIRB# 19942 Version # 4.0 16 APR 2020 PI: Lara Davis, MD 22 All screening evaluations are to be conducted within 8 weeks prior to start of exercise intervention. Screening (consultation) visit may occur as part of standard of care. The following will be reviewed at screening: • Eligibility criteria • Informed consent obtained and documented 5.4 BASELINE ASSESSMENTS All baseline assessments should be completed within 14 days before initiating the exercise intervention; however, these assessments may be performed during Week 1 prior to initiating exercise intervention. Eligible participants enrolled into this study will be asked to provide response to four questionnaires: GLTEQ, PROMIS -Cancer -PF, SF-36 and FACT -F. Surveys will be completed online unless the participants prefer to complete using a paper version. Study staff will review surveys for completeness and follow -up with participants in person or by phone for missing data. Participants should ideally complete initial physical function assessments (refer to Section 6.1.6) as well as body composition and bone mineral density (refer to Section 6.1.7 ) on same day. The exact order of the individual physical function assessments will be determined by the EP at the initial visit, but should be preferentially maintained for all subsequent time- points. This initial visit should take approximately 2 hours. If the visit is performed virtually, height, body compos ition and bone mineral density measures will be omitted. At this visit, participants will receive study exercise equipment and instructions from the EP regarding their individualized PRT regimen. If this visit is performed virtually, participants will receive study exercise equipment via courier. Refer to Section 6.8, Schedule of Events for additional details. 5.5 ASSESSMENTS DURING T REATMENT Participants will perform one weekly training under the supervision of an EP trainer via 1:1 web- based videoconferencing for the first two weeks . This first set of 1:1 videoconferencing will be used to observe and modify the PRT regimen for each participant. Any changes to an individual participant’s PRT regimen (e.g., number of repetitions per set, number of sets, and/or mass of weights) should be recorded in the CRF. After two weeks, the participant may decide to join a group video conference with 1- 2 other participants, or continue 1:1 with the EP. The weekly videoconferencing should ideally occur between Monday through Friday of each study week. Under certain circumstances (e.g., technical difficulties ), videoco nferencing may be rescheduled. The reason for rescheduling should be recorded in the CRF. 5.6 END OF STUDY VISIT A ND EARLY TERMINATION VI SIT The end of study visit will occur as part of a scheduled follow up at 3 months from start of the protocol -directed PR T regimen.

(Note: individuals in Oregon aged ≥15 years are able to consent to medical and dental services without consent of a legally authorized representative (e.g., parent/legal guardian [ ORS 109.640 ]). 5.9 OHSU PARTICIPANT REGISTRATION PROCEDURES Participants will be required to give written informed consent to participate in the study before any screening tests or evaluations are conducted that are not part of standard care. Registration from all consented participants must be entered into the OHSU electronic Clinical Research Management Syst em (CRMS, e.g., eCRIS). At a minimum, registration of OHSU participant s will include signed copies of the most recently Institutional Review Board ( IRB)- approved, informed consent form and HIPAA authorization. 5.10 PARTICIPANT SCREENING AND ENROLLMENT Potential participants will be screened using an IRB approved phone script. If eligible, an appointment will be made for consenting and initial testing. In order to participate in this study, signed informed consent must be obtained from the participant. The current IRB -approved informed consent must be signed and dated by each participant prior to undergoing any study procedures. Baseline evaluations will begin once the participant has provided written informed consent to participate in the study and ends when the participant initiate s the study exercise regimen. Study participants may be enrolled on to the study once all eligibility criteria are sat isfied. 5.11 PARTICIPANT WITHDRAW AL OR DISCONTINUATION FROM STUDY INTERVENTION Participants are free to withdraw consent and discontinue participation in the study at any time and without prejudice to further treatment. If a participant no longer wishes to participate in the interventional exercise regimen, but is willing to come for follow -up appointments, the participant’s request should be honored, if possible. The following are examples demonstrating why a participant’s exercise intervention might be di scontinued. • Adverse effects of the assigned exercise intervention precludes further study participation . • Disease recurrence or progression. • Investigator’s discretion. No further participant contact should be made if the participant withdraws consent for participation in the study. Information about the reason(s) for discontinuation and collection of any new or ongoing adverse events (AEs) should be collected at the time the participant withdraws consent. 5.11.1 HANDLING PARTICIPANT WITHDRAWAL AND DISCONTINUATION Participants enrolled in this study that withdraw prior to initiating on-study exercise intervention will be replaced. Participants that initiate on -study exercise intervention and subsequently withdraw , will not be replaced."

Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, will be provided by the suspending or terminating party to funding agency, IRB, and other regulatory authorities . If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Investigator will promptly inform the IRB and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension. Reasons for terminating the study may include the following: • Incidence or severity of adverse events, in this or other studies, indicates a potential health hazard to participants. • Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping. • Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable. • Investigator(s) do not adhere to the study protocol, or applicable regulatory guidelines in conducting the study. • Participant enrollment is unsatisfactory. • Submission of knowingly false information from the study site to regulatory authorities. • Upon instruc tion by local or other regulatory, or oversight authority. Study may resume once concerns about safety, protocol compliance, data quality are addressed and satisfy the IRB or other regulatory authority . 6. TREATMENT PLA N 6.1 FUNCTIONAL RESISTANCE TRAINING REGIMEN Participants enrolled in this study will be assigned an individualized resistance training regimen that is based on guidelines from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) .28,29,31 The resistance exercise regimen consists of upper and lower body exercises and may use free weights (i.e., dumbbells), weighted vests, resistance bands and/or the participants’ body weight . The resistance exercises employed in this study are all common to activities of daily living, and have been previously described .27,30 In this study , participants will be assigned an individualized regimen consisting of PRT exercises that are to be performed 2 times per week for a total of 12 weeks (Table 2). Each exercise session will consist of a maximum of 3 sets, with no more than 15 repetitions per set. A rest period of 1 to 2 minutes should be included between each set. Participants are required to rest at least one day between each exercise session."
26,page_26,"Improving Physical Function in Sarcoma Survivors Protocol number: eIRB# 19942 Version # 4.0 16 APR 2020 PI: Lara Davis, MD 27 Following the baseline assessment, the EP trainer will individualize the participant’s training program; additional modifications to the exercise program may be introduced during video session s as necessary. The individualized t raining regimen will be progressive, and the intensity of each exercise will be dependent on the resistance relative to the participant’s capability . 6.1.1 INITIALTRAINING SESSION If the initial visit is performed in-person, participants will be provided with the necessary equipment (i.e., resistance bands, weights, weighted vest as appropriate) and receive in- person verbal and written instruction from an EP trainer on how to use the equipment and perform each assigned exercise. During periods of hospital recommendations for decreased in- person contact, the initial study visit may be omitted, delayed, or delivered entirely virtually . If the initial visit is delivered virtually , participants will receive study exercise equipment via courier, verbal instruction from an EP trainer on how to use the equipment and perform each assigned exercise by phone or teleconference, and written instruction from an EP trainer on how to use the equipment and perform each assigned exercise by email and/or courier. Select testing measures will be adapted to this type of delivery. These testing measures include: • Weight • Physical Performance Battery (PPB) • All surveys will continue to be sent out electronically as previously described. If a participant needs a paper survey to complete the survey, one will be provided or their data will be marked as “missed” if study staff are unable to mail a paper survey to the participant during their outlined testing window. To assess upper body strength remotely, novel assessments to this trial will include: • Push -up (modified) test (if applicable): Measured by the number of push- ups completed in one continuous bout until fatigue • Plank test (if applicable): Measured by the amount of time in seconds that the participant Table 2.

To assess lower body strength remotely, novel assessments to this trial will include: • Posture squat (if applicable): Measured by the amount of time in seconds that the participant is able to hold a posture squat position. 6.1.2 VIDEOCONFERENCING & INDEPENDENT EXERCI SE Each participant must have access to a device with internet connection and audio/video capability in order to be eligible for this study. A webcam may be provided if needed, but should be returned at the end of study. Participants will receive written instructions for installing and using the OHSU -approved videoconferencing software. Participants will perform all exercise sessions remotely (e.g., at home) . One exercise session per week will be conducted under the supervision of an EP trainer using videoconferenci ng software. During these web-based video conferences, the EP trainer will observe the participant and provide feedback on technique, as well as implement progressive resistance (e.g., increase number of repetitions or increase weight) . Each participant will also complete one-hour of prescribed resistance exercise independently each week and record their effort in a training log. 6.1.3 END-OF-STUDY 3 MONTH FOLLOW -UP The exercise intervention will be conducted for a total of 12 weeks; however, participants will be encouraged to continue resistance training after completing the study intervention. An end of study visit will occur approximately 3 months ( ±14 days) after first home PRT session . During periods of hospital recommendations for decreased in- person contact, the end of study visit may be omitted, delayed, or delivered entirely virtually . After successful completion of the end- of-study assessments, participants will be allowed to keep all study -related exercise equipment provided (e.g., resistance bands, dumbbells, weighted vests). Participants will be required to return the webcam if one was provided. 6.2 EXERCISE MODIFICATIONS Between the initial assessment & first video- conferenced session, the EP trainer may further individualize each participants ’ training program. These modifications will be introduced during the first videoconference training session. Alterations (individualization) of the exercise regimen will be based on the participant’s limitations. These will primarily be related to decreased range of motion in a specific joint or reduced weight bearing potential in a muscle group. Exercises involving that specific joint/muscle group will proceed “as tolerated.” Exercises on the contralateral side will continue unaltered. Any modifications to the exercises will be recorded in the participants’ training log. If necessary, and at the discretion of the EP, the intensity of one or all exercises may be increased or decreased by altering the number of sets, lower band resistanc e, or time held for each exercise. All changes will be recorded in the participants’ training log. 6.2.1 EXERCISE DELAYS In general, interruptions to scheduled exercise sessions are permitted in the case of medical /"
28,page_28,"Improving Physical Function in Sarcoma Survivors Protocol number: eIRB# 19942 Version # 4.0 16 APR 2020 PI: Lara Davis, MD 29 surgical events or logistical reasons (e.g., elective surgery, unrelated medical events, vacation, and holidays) not related to study intervention. Participants should resume exercise intervention within 2 weeks of the scheduled interruption, unless otherwise discussed with the investigator. The reason for interruption should be documented in the CRF. Missed exercise sessions (including videoconferencing) may be completed within the same scheduled week as long as there is at least 1 day of rest between sessions . 7. EFFICACY MEASURES 7.1 GLTEQ To score the GLTEQ, the weekly frequencies of strenuous, moderate, and light activities are multiplied by nine, five, and three, respectively. Total weekly leisure activity is calculated in arbitrary units by summing the products of the separate components, as shown in the following formula: Weekly leisure activity score = (9 × Strenuous) + (5 × Moderate) + (3 × Light) The same method of score is applied for each specific question. 7.2 PROMIS -CANCER PHYSICAL FUNCTION A SSESSMENT For adults, each question in the PROMIS -Cancer survey has five response options ranging in value from one to five. The total raw score for the survey with all questions answered is derived by calculating the sum of the values of the response to each question. Once calculated, a conversion table translates the raw scores into a T -score. The T -score rescales the raw score into a standardized score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. The standardized T -score is reported as the final score for each participant as follows: • Scores 0.5 – 1.0 SD worse than the mean = mild symptoms/impairment • Scores 1.0 – 2.0 SD worse than the mean = moderate symptoms/impairment • Scores 2.0 SD or more worse than the mean = severe symptoms/impairment 7.3 QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36) Scoring and analysis of the SF -36 survey will be performed as previously described. 35 All items in this survey are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state. 7.4 FATIGUE (FACT -F) Fatigue was assessed using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue (FACT -F) scale. This is a 13 item, uni -dimensional, 5- point Likert scale, measuring physical fatigue over the past week. The scale has high internal consistency 36 and is widely used in the literature. 7.5 SHORT PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE BATTERY (PPB) The short PPB consists of three timed tests: 5 repeated chair stands, standing balance, and gait speed over 4 meters. Each test is scored 0 (unable) to 4, based on quartiles of performance,40 then scores are summed. Higher scores indicate better physical function."

Three separate tests should be conducted, with a rest of 10- 20 seconds between each squeeze to avoid muscle fatigue. The force exerted is measured to the nearest kg. 7.8 GAIT AND BALAN CE Balance and gait will be measured using body worn sensors (iMobility, APDM, Inc.) , which continuously and wirelessly record 3D linear accelerations and angular velocity . An instrumented postural sway test (I Sway) will record center of pressure displacement and acceleration signals during 30-second s of quiet standing . 41 iMobility is also used for an instrumented version of the timed- up-and-GO (TUG) test, iTUG, to detect changes in mobility in patients that may not be not apparent from a stopwatch score.42 For each study participant, standard TUG will also be evaluated by measuring the time that it takes an individual to rise from a chair, walk 7 meters, turn around and return to the chair in a seated position. Finally, study participants will be asked to complete a 6-minute walk test (i6MWT) while wearing the iMobility sensors. In addition to the standard metrics obtained from iMobility, the number of meters walked during the 6- minutes will also be recorded. 7.9 BODY COMPOSITION AND BONE MINERAL DENSIT Y Body composition w ill be expressed as % whole- body lean mass and leg lean mass (kg). Coefficients of variation (CV) for lean and fat mass in our laboratory are <1.0% . DXA scans will be analyzed following standard procedures (Hologic Inc) . Visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) ad ipose tissue will also be quantified from the whole body scans. Trained research staff will utilize the DXA manufacturer software (Apex, Hologic Inc.) to analyze each scan by loading it onto the DXA analysis workstation where it can be assessed using the appropriate DXA software. The trained research staff member will analyze the scan by reviewing and modifying the bone edges and positioning markers to define the necessary regions of interest. In general, the software will automatically detect bone edges; however, if needed, a trained research staff can intervene to manually identify the bone edges. Once analyzed, the scan will be saved and archived with the results of the analysis included. 8. SAFETY 8.1 SPECIFICATION OF SAF ETY PARAMETERS The Investigator is responsible for monitoring the safety of participants who have enrolled in the study. Safety assessments will be based on medical review of adverse event s and the results of safety evaluations at specified time points as described in Section 1.1. Any clinically significant adverse events persi sting at the end of treatment visit will be followed by the Investigator until resolution, stabilization , or death, whichever comes first."
30,page_30,"Improving Physical Function in Sarcoma Survivors Protocol number: eIRB# 19942 Version # 4.0 16 APR 2020 PI: Lara Davis, MD 31 8.2 REPORTING PROCEDURES Adverse events during exercise sessions will be graded according to their significance for seve re consequences, such as injury or death, using the following grades determined by the OHSU IRB. In this study we do not anticipate moderate or serious adverse events. • A serious adverse event is defined as any event that is life- threatening or disabling and requiring medical attention. Serious adverse events that may occur during exercise in this study include death and cardiovascular events, though these are extremely rare in the absence of significant cardiac pathology. • A moderate adverse event is defined as any event that resolves with treatment. Moderate adverse events that may occur during exercise include symptoms, such as shortness of breath and orthostatic intolerance. • A mild adverse event is defined as any event that does not require treatment. Reports of side effects, such as muscle soreness, moderate tiredness while exercising, and similar discomforts are mild adverse events. • An unexpected adverse event is defined as any event that does not include physical harm. Examples of unexpected adverse events may include breaches of confidentiality, emotional harms, or complaints about study procedures or conduct of investigators. A survey (Adverse Events Survey) was created by the study team to be administered electronically every other week during the participants’ 12- week long participation in the study. Adverse events reported through this survey will be followed- up by study staff with a phone call when the self -reported severity is a 5 (moderate) or greater or if more information is needed to determine reportability. Participants will also have the opportunity to report adverse events during the home- program video calls. Serious adverse events will be reported immediately to the Principal Investigator (PI), who will immediately notify all other investigators. The PI will file a full written report to the OHSU Institutional Review Board (IRB) within 24 hours of notification of the serious event, as required by the OHSU IRB. Specifically, the following will be reported, in writing: 1. All deaths in study participants, during the intervention period, regardless of cause, 2. All serious adverse events associated with the study procedures Cardiac events or deaths are very rare in persons engaging in low or moderate intensity exercise, though it is possible that a person with previously undisclosed cardiovascular disease may experience a cardiac event or death during exercise. Regardless of cause, we are required to notify the OHSU IRB within 24 hours if a participant dies during this study. Moderate adv erse events will be tabulated by the PI, who will notify members of the research team if trends are identified. If trends are noted, preventive measures will be implemented, such as providing education of participants in the study to emphasize prevention of the adverse event. Moderate adverse events will be included in annual reports to the OHSU IRB. Mild adverse events will be entered in progress notes. Participants will receive advice on avoiding such events."
31,page_31,"Improving Physical Function in Sarcoma Survivors Protocol number: eIRB# 19942 Version # 4.0 16 APR 2020 PI: Lara Davis, MD 32 Unexpected adverse events that do not include physical harm, usually having to do with study procedures, will be reported within 10 days to OHSU IRB, using a written report form. 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS Refer to Section 3.1, Description of the Study Design for a detailed description of the study design and endpoints. 9.1 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS Participants evaluable for analysis includes all enrolled participants that completed baseline physical function assessment and completed at least one day of exercise intervention. 9.2 DESCRIPTION OF STATI STICAL METHODS 9.2.1 GENERAL APPROACH This is a single -arm, prospective study to assess feasibility of implementing a resistance training regimen in sarcoma survivors. 9.2.2 ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY AND SECONDARY FEASIBILITY ENDPOINT S Among evaluable participants, the retention rate, exercise adherence rate and rate of PRT prescriptions provided will be estimated using percentage and 95% confidence interval . The incidence of exercise- related serious adverse events will be evaluated using descriptive statistics. The primary objective of feasibility will be determined by the study achieving 90% participant retention [i.e., 9 of 10 patients complete end- of-intervention assessments] with more than 75% exercise adherence rate [each participants completed end- of-intervention assessment also completed at least 18 of 24 prescribed training sessions] without related serious adverse events. Successful development of individualized PRT prescription based on functional limitations also be determined as a secondary feasibility measure [100% of subjects receive individualized PRT prescription]. 9.2.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECO NDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS The efficacy measurements, including four questionnaires (GLTEQ, PROMIS -Cancer -PF, SF-36 and FACT -F) and physical assessments (short PPB, 1RM, grip strength, i6MWT, iTUG, I Sway) wearable mobility sensor) at baseline and at end of exercise intervention (i.e., 3 months from start of PRT regimen) will be summarized as mean and standard deviation. We also compare scores at baseline and at 3 months using paired t -Test to determine if a 3-month resistance training program improves physical function. As standard practice, we will initially examine distribution of each outcome variable using Shapiro- Wilk test, as well as data visualization techniques. If normality assumption is violated, we will consider transforming the data or adopting non- parametric approaches. 9.2.4 ANALYSIS OF THE EXPL ORATORY ENDPOINTS Body composition and bone mineral density at baseline and end of exercise intervention ( i.e., 3 months from start of PRT regimen) will be summarized as mean and standard deviation. They are also be compared using paired t -Test to determine if a 3- month resistance- training program improves body composition and bone mineral density in sarcoma survivors."

This is a feasibility study with no formal hypothesis test but to assess the preliminary estimate of feasibility. 9.4 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA Every attempt will be made to obtain data at the defined time points as described in the primary and secondary endpoints. We will examine dropout and patterns of missing data to determine mechanisms (MCAR, MAR or not ignorable). In the case of data missing MCAR or MAR, mixed -effect m odel will allow unbiased parameter estimation using all available data. We will adapt an imputation technique if missing is not a completed random. 10. CLINICAL MONITORING 10.1 OHSU KNIGHT CANCER I NSTITUTE DATA & SAFETY MONITORING P LAN This study is under the oversight of the Knight Cancer Institute’s DSMC as described in the Knight institutional DSMP. The Knight DSMP outlines the elements required to ensure the safety of clinical trial participant s, the accuracy and integrity of the data and the appropriate modification of cancer -related clinical trials for which significant benefits or risks have been discovered or when the clinical trial cannot be successfully concluded. The Knight DSMP also describes the methods and procedures for ensuring adequate oversight of cancer -related research at OHSU. As described in the Knight DSMP, regardless of a trial’s risk level and any specific Knight oversight in place, the Investigator is singularly responsible for overseeing every aspect of the design, conduct, and final analysis of his/her investigation. The Knight DSMC will review and monitor study progress, toxicity, safety and other data from this study. Information that raises any questions about participant safety or protocol performance will be addressed by the Investigator , statistician and study team. Should any major concerns arise, the Knight DSMC may recommend corrective action and determine whether or not to suspend the study. The Knight DSMC will review each protocol every 6 months, but may occur more often, if required, to review toxicity and accrual data (please refer to Knight DSMP for additional details on audit frequency). The Knight DSMC will review accrual, toxicity, response and reporting information. Information to be provided to the DSMC may include: participant accrual; treatment regimen information; AEs and SAEs reported by category; summary of any deaths on study; audit results; and a summary provided by the study team. Other information (e.g. scans, laboratory values) will be provided upon request. 10.2 CLINICAL DATA & SAFETY MONITORING The OHSU Investigator is ultimately, singularly responsible for overseeing every aspect of the investigation, including design, governing conduct at all participating sites, and final anal ysis of"

You are being asked to take part in this study because you have previou sly received treatment for a sarcoma . Treatments for sarcoma can cause side effects such as fatigue, muscle loss, and weakness, which can negatively impact your ability to physically function and enjoy an independent lifestyle . People who do not take part in this study may receive recommendations such as encouragement to exercise, and/or ways to adjust their daily activities to help combat some of the physical side effects of cancer trea tment. WHAT ARE MY OTHER CHOICES IF I DO NOT TA KE PART IN THIS STUD Y? If you decide not to take part in this study, you have other choices. For example: • you may choose to continue your current care without change • you may choose to take part in a different study, if one is available PURPOSE WHY IS THIS STUDY BE ING DONE? The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of using a routine resistance training exercise regimen as a means to improve physical function in sarcoma cancer survivors. The study also aims to determine if a 3- month exercise program improves body composition and bone density in sarcoma survivors post -treatment. The resistance training exercise regimen we are studying is experimental. We do not know if it is better than the usual approach for improving physical function in people that have been treated for sarcoma. This is a clinical trial, a type of research study. Medical personnel who carry out research studies are called “investigators.” The investigator will explain the clinical trial to you. Clinical trials include only people who choose to take part. Please take your time to make your decision about taking part. You can discuss your decision with your friends and family. You can also discuss it with your health care tea m or another doctor. If you have any questions, ask the investigator. WHAT DATA WILL BE CO LLECTED? We are asking you to provide information for a data bank, also called a repository. This information will be stored indefinitely and may be used and disclosed in the future for research. We will ask you to provide the following information: • Your demographics – your current age and your sex, race, ethnicity, and the zip code where you currently live."

HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS S TUDY? As many as 10 people will take part in this study, which will be conducted at Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU). PROCEDURES STUDY DESIGN OVERVIE W HOW LONG WILL I BE I N THIS STUDY? You will receive an individualized therapeutic resistance exercise plan to complete over a 12 -week period. After you finish the resistance exercise regimen , your doctor will see you for a 3 -month follow up visit to assess side effects . The total length of your participation is about 3-months."

Before you begin the study: If you are in terested in participating, you will be asked a few questions regarding your cancer history, current physical activity, and quality of life. Your doctor will assess you for medical clearance for you to participate in exercise training before your exercise p lan starts. Physician clearance is required to participate in the study because it will help ensure your safety to perform moderate level intensity exercise. We will collect information about your cancer diagnosis and treatment from your medical records. Y ou will next be scheduled to complete a series of baseline assessments (see below) with a Research Assistant. You will need to have the following tests and procedures to find out if you can be in the study: Baseline assessment visit: • Record height and weight • DXA scan to evaluate your bone density and body composition. A urine pregnancy test for women who can become pregnant is required prior to DXA scan. • Questionnaires , which will take roughly 1 hour to complete . • A series of physical tests to measure a baseline for strength, balance, and function. A Research Assistant will guide you through a series of activities. These activities include rising and sitting from a chair five times as quickly as you can and rising from a chair, walking about 10 feet, turning around, walking about 10 feet back to the chair, and sitting down. If in-person assessments are not feasible, the study visits may be omitted, delayed, or modified to best suit your needs. During the study: If the exams, tests, and procedures show that you can take part in the study, and you choose to take part, then you will be asked to complete a one -hour exercise training session two times per week for the next 3 months . For the first two weeks, p articipants will perform one weekly training under the supervision of a trainer via 1 :1 web -based videoconferencing, and the second training session will be completed on your own. An Exercise Physiologist (EP) trainer will create an individualized training program for you. After two weeks, you may decide to join a group video conference with 1 -2 other participants, or continue 1:1 with the EP. At the baseline visit, participants will be provided with the necessary equipment (i.e., resistance bands, weights , weighted vest as appropriate) and receive in- person verbal and written instruction from a trainer on how to use the equipment and perform each assigned exercise."

One exercise session per week will be conducted under the supervision of an EP trainer using videoconferencing software. During these web- based video conferences, the EP trainer will observe the participant and provide feedback on technique, as well as implement progressi ve resistance (e.g., increase number of repetit ions or increase weight). Each participant will also complete one -hour of prescribed resistance exercise independently each week and record in a provided training log . The exercise intervention will be conducted for a total of 12 weeks, but participants will be encouraged to continue resistance training after completing the study. At the end of your 3 -month participation, you will be asked to return for a follow up visit. A study schedule that shows how often these tests and exercises will be done is attached. RISKS WHAT POSSIBLE RISKS CAN I EXPECT FROM TA KING PART IN THIS ST UDY? DXA Scans: In this study you will be exposed to radiation during the DXA scans. While no radiation dose has been determined to be entirely safe, the amount to which you will be exposed is not known to cause health problems. For women of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be checked prior to the DXA scan. Physical Tests: There are some discomforts and risks from the physical tests. In order to try to minimize risks, all testing will be conducted by trained personnel. You may feel sore after the physical tests. Muscle soreness usually goes away after two or three days. You may sustain an injury duri ng the physical testing. The risk of this is low and the researchers are trained to show you the best ways to avoid injury during the tests. Questionnaires: As part of this study, you will be asked to complete questionnaires. Some of these questions may s eem very personal or embarrassing. They may upset you. You may refuse to answer any of the questions that you do not wish to answer. If the questions make you very upset, we will help you to find a counselor. As with any form of regular exercise training, the risk of injury is increased. We have taken precautions to make the exercises as safe as possible. The exercises will be led by a certified exercise professional. The study exercises have been performed before in cancer survivors who have reported no s ignificant injuries as a result of the study. Here are important points about how you and the investigator can make these risks less of a problem:"

The investigator can allow for a longer rest period during the test or reschedule it for a different day. • Tell the investigator if you are unwilling to complete a test or survey. You do not have to complete som e or all tests and surveys. Let your investigator know of any questions you have about possible side effects. You can ask the investigator questions about side effects at any time. BENEFITS WHAT POSSIBLE BENEFITS CAN I EXPECT FROM TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY? Participants may not benefit from participating in this study; however, their participation may contribute to knowledge used for future studies that address patients with cancer. Additionally, an exercise regimen may improve your physical function. No compensation will be provided to you for your involvement in this study. After s uccessful completion, you will be allowed to keep all study -related exercise equipment provided (e.g., resistance bands, dumbbells, weighted vests).
