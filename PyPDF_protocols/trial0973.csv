13,page_13,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 13/Protocol WA40169 , Version 1Study Design Description of Study This study is an open -label clinical study. Patients who have completed the treatment period of Study GA39688 /GA39855 and fulfill the eligibility criteria for the open -label extension (OLE) study will be enrolled. Patients will be eligible for enrollment in the study at the W eek 24 visit of StudyGA39688/GA39855 or within 28 day s after the W eek 24 visit of StudyGA39688/GA39855. Whenever possible, patients should enrol l and begin open- label dosing of omalizumab at the Week 24 visit of Study GA39688/GA39855 rather than return for a subsequent visit. However, if necessary, patients may return within 28 days of the Week 24 visit of Study GA39688/GA39855 to enroll and begi n dosing. The rationale for enrolling patients into this OLE study at the W eek 24 visit of Study GA39688/GA39855, or within a short period of time thereafter, is to allow for relatively continuous exposure to omalizumab over a 52 -week period of time. Enr ollment at the Week 24 visit of Study GA39688/GA39855 may also reduce patient burden by obviating the need for an additional clinic visit. Informed consent into this OLE study must be completed by the time of enrollment and open- label omalizumab dosing. Whenever possible, investigators should begin the consent process for this OLE study well in advance of the Week 24 visit of Study GA39688/GA39855. Providing information about this OLE study to patients early in Study GA39688/GA39855 will facilitate a seamless transition into this protocol. After enrollment into this OLE study, patients will receive 28 weeks of dosing of open -label omalizum ab before entering a 24 -week off -treatm ent observation phase of the study. In this protocol, the timing of the visit schedule for this OLE study is defined in time relative to the baseline of Study GA39688/GA39855. That is, the first visit of this OLE study is referred to as the ""Week 24 Visit."" Similarly, the last visit occurring during the 28 -week treatment phase is referred to as the ""W eek52 Visit,"" and the final visit of the 24 -week follow -up period is referred to as the ""W eek76 Visit."" Note that the W eek 52 Visit is not only considered to be the last visit of the treatment phase, but also the first visit of the follow -up period. The first dose of open -label omalizumab should be administered on the day of enrollment into this OLE study (""W eek 24 Visit""). The dosing table will be the same as that used w ith StudyGA39688/GA39855 . Patients should remain on stable d oses of intranasal corticosteroid (CS) therapy (mometasone nasal spray 200 g twice a day [BID]) for the entire treatment and follow -up periods. That is, patients should remain on stable doses of intranasal CS therapy for both the treatment period of StudyGA39688/GA39855, the treatment period of this current study, and the follow -up period of this current study. As in Study GA39688/GA39855, patients deemed by the investigator to be intolerant to a BID regimen of mometasone may remain on a stable dosage of mo metasone once daily (QD) (two sprays/nostril, both nostrils, 50 g/spray QD for a total daily dosage of 200g). Any patient transitioned to daily mometasone should remain on this regimen for the remainder of the study. Safety, efficacy , and patient -reported outcome (PRO) measures will be assessed during the treatment and follow -up periods, as detailed in the schedule of activities . After the treatment period ends (after Week 52 Visit), patients will be followed for an additional 24weeks as part o f the follow -up period . There is no dose administered at Week 52. During the follow -up period, patients will be asked to continue completion of their daily electronic diary (eDiar y) assessment of nasal sy mptoms. An important objective of this portion of this study will be to understand the extent and timing of any relapse in sy mptoms related to nasal polyposis. Patients will return to clinic at Week 64 and for a final visit at Week 76, with telephone visits at Weeks56, 60, 68, and 72. All patients who discontinue study drug early during the treatment period will be asked to complete the remainder of the treatment period and then complete the 24- week follow -up period. For example, if a patient discontinues study drug at Week 32, that patient would be asked to return for the W eek 36 and W eek 52 visits to complete all assessments and would then complete the follow -up visits. Nasal polyp score (NPS) will be assessed by video nasal endoscopy, scored using a standard scoring system (maximum NPS is 8) by a c entral panel of independent sinus surgeons who are"

Number of Patients All subjects completing Week 24 of Study GA39688/GA39855 and otherwise meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria are eligible to enroll. It is anticipated that a maximum of approximately 240 patients will enroll into this study. Target Population Inclusion Criteria Patients must meet the following criteria for study entry:  Signed Informed Consent Form  Age 18 75 years old, inclusive, at time of signing informed consent form for Study GA39688 or Study GA39855  Ability to comply with the study protocol , in the investigator's judgment  Participation in Study GA39688 or Study GA 39855, including completion of endoscopy and other assessments at Week 24, with out discontinuation of study drug  Completion of eDiary daily assessments for at l east 4 out of 7 days in the week prior to the Week 24 visit of Study GA39688 or Study GA39855  For women of childbearing potential: agr eement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use acceptable contraceptive methods during the treatment period and for 60 days after the last dose of study drug – Abstinence is only acceptable if it is in li ne with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ov ulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. – Acceptable methods of contraception include su rgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal ligation, vasectomized partner), hormonal contraception (e.g., implantable, injectable, patch, oral), and intrauterine device (IUD). – Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test result prior to initiation of study drug in this study. Exclusion Criteria Patients who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from study entry:  Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity related to study drug in Study GA39688/GA39855  Serious adverse events related to study drug in Study GA39688/GA39855 that the investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize the patient's safety if he or she continues in the study  Uncontrolled epistaxis within Study GA39688 or GA39855  Pregnant or breastfeeding, or intending to become pregnant during the study or within 60 days after the last dose of omalizumab  Any serious medical condition or abnormality in clinical laboratory tests that, in the investigator's judgment, precludes the patient's safe participation in and completion of the study End of Study and Length of Study The end of the study is defined as the date of the last patient's last visit (LPLV). The LPLV is expected to occur approximately 52 weeks after the last patent is enrolled (28-week treatment period of OLE followed by 24-week follow-up period). Investigational Medicinal Products The investigational medicinal product (IMP) for this study is omalizumab."
15,page_15,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 15/Protocol WA40169 , Version 1Test Product (Investigational Drug) Study drug (omalizumab) will be administered subcutaneously to patients using a disposable 25-gauge needle in the deltoid region of the right or left arm. Alternatively, the in jections can be administered in the thigh, if medically significant reasons preclude administration in the deltoid region. Omalizumab will be administered subcutaneously every 2 or 4 weeks. Because the solution is slightly viscous, the injection may take 510 seconds to administer. The dose (mg) and dosing frequency will be determined by serum total IgE level (IU/mL) (measured before the start of treatment via central laboratory) and body weight (kg). Assignment of omalizumab dose will be determined by u sing the study drug dosing table. Doses of 150 mg are divided among more than one injection site to limit injections to no more than 150 mg per site. The reconstituted vial is to be used for single -dose administration only. Non-Investigational Medicinal Products In this study, mometasone furoate monohydrate nasal spray is considered a non -IMPand is used as background therapy only. Statistical Methods Primary A nalysis The analysis of complete data from the study, including data from the safety follow -up period , will be performed when all patients have either discontinued the study early or completed the safety follow -up period, all data from the study are in the database, and the database is cleaned and locked. Determination of Sample Size No formal sample size calculation was performed for this study because the primary analysis is descriptive in nature, there will be no formal hypothesis testing, and this study is an OLE of previous studies ( Studies GA39688 andGA39855), which plan to enroll approximately 240 patients in total (120 patients each) . In order to be eligible for enrollment into this study, the patient must complete assessments at Week 24 in the prior study without discontinuation of study drug. Therefore, due to the inclusion cr iteria of this study and potential dropout from Studies GA39688 andGA39855 , the sample size of approximately 240 patients is a maximum."

BACKGROUND 1.1 BACKGROUND ON CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS WITH NASAL POLYPS Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) is a predominantly adult disease with a prevalence estimated to be 2.1% 2.7% ( Johansson et al. 2003 ; Klossek et al. 2005 ; We et al. 2015). It is associated with reduced quality of life ( QoL)and significant morbidity, including asthma, which can be severe and refractory, part icularly in those patients with aspirin -exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) ( Hulse et al. 2014; Stevens and Schleimer 2016 ). The diagnosis of CRSwNP is made in patients who exhibit a combin ation of symptoms (e.g., blockage/congestion, anterior or postnasal drip, and impaired sense of smell) in the presence of nasal polyps ( Fokkens et al. 2012; Rimmer et al. 2014 ). Intranasal and systemic/oral corticosteroids remain the mainstay of treatment, but many patients fail to achieve complete therapeutic benefit with these medications and resort to functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) and other complex sinus surgery ( Fokkens et al. 2012 ; Rimmer et al.2014 ). Although FESS and intranasal and oral corticosteroids are useful and often effective in reducing the size of nasal polyps and associated symptoms , many patients do not respond sufficiently and/or polyps return rapidly after medicat ion withdrawal or within months oryears following surgery. In one trial, almost 40% of patients who received daily intranasal corticosteroids (mometasone furoate) following FESS suffered a relapse within 6 months of the procedure ( Stjärne et al.2009 ). In another study, almost 50% of the patients who received oral corticosteroids in combination with topical therapy suffered a relapse within 12 months of treatment ( Cassano et al. 1996 ). Moreover, oral cortic osteroids are associated with significant side effects, and repeat surgical procedures become progressively more complex and risky. Inthe U nited States , the only approved pharmacotherapy for nasal polyps is intranasal cort icosteroids (mometasone furoate and/or beclomethasone). Because of limitations in treatment, combined with QoL that is considerably reduced in CRSwNP patients, nasal polyposis remains an important unmet medical need ( Hulse et al. 2015 ). Patients with CRSwN P and most pati ents with asthma share a common IgE-mediated type2 inflammatory response, characterized by elevated levels of interleukin (IL) -4, IL- 5, IL-13, eosinophils, Th2 cells ,and type 2 innate lymphoid cells ( Wenzel etal.1999 ; Kato 2015 ). In addition, locally produced IgE often against Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins  is associated with local inflammation in CRSwNP and, in particular, with comorbid asthma ( Bachert et al. 2010 ). Because of the common type 2 inflammatory disease between asth ma and CRSwNP, approximately 20% 30% of patients with asthma have CRSwNP, particularly those patients with AERD . In addition , asubstantial proportion of patients with CRSwNP have symptoms of asthma, with higher percentages associated with patients who have greater nasal polyp disease severity (Settipane 1987 ;Larsen 1996 ; Hedman etal. 1999 ; Johansson et al. 2003; Ragab et al. 2004 ;Pearlman etal. 2009 ; Promsopa etal. 2016 ). Importantly, there appears to be a premorbid relationship between"
19,page_19,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 19/Protocol WA40169 , Version 1asthma and CRSwNP, with the diagnosis of asthma often occurring prior to that of nasal polyposis ( Larsen 1996 ; Tan et al. 2013 ; Lam et al. 2014 ). 1.2 BACKGROUND ON OMA LIZUMA B Omalizumab (Xolair®) is a recombinant DNA -derived humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody with a molecular mass of approximately 149 kDathat selectively binds to human IgE. Omalizumab is designed to treat IgE -mediated disease by reducing the concentration of free IgE in blood and in tissue. Omalizumab selectively binds to human IgE at the same site as does the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc RI) (Schulman 2001 ), thereby reducing surface -bound IgE through this receptor on basophils and mast cells, reducing cross- linking of IgE to the receptor when antigen is bound and the subsequent basophil and mast cell triggered type 2 inflammation. Omalizumab wasapproved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for allergic asthma in 2003 andforchronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) , also known as chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) , in 2014. Refer to the Omalizumab Investigator 's Brochure for details on nonc linical and clinical studies. 1.3 STUDY RA TIONA LE A ND BENEFIT RISK A SSESSMENT This study will assess the long -term safety and tolerability of omalizumab every 2 or 4weeks with regard to adverse events and laboratory a bnormalities and will also obtain long-term data on the efficacy of omalizumab in patients with CRSwNP after participation in thePhase III studies (GA39688 orGA39855) . Patients will enroll in this study f ollowing the completion of the P hase III ,double -blind ,placebo -controlled Study GA39688 orGA39855 . Eligible pa tients receiving omalizumab or placebo in the controlled Phase III study will receive active omalizumab in this study for approximately 28 weeks followed by an approximately 24- week post -treatment follow -up period. Eligibility criteri a and th e timepoints for enrollment in this study are described in Section 4.1. 1.3.1 Benefit Risk Assessment CRSwNP occurs in a subset of patients with chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ). The polyps that develop in patients with CRSwNP are characterized histological ly by the presence of large numbers of eosinophils and type 2 innate lymphoid cells a s well as by mucosal edema and albumin containing pseudocysts with minimal extracellular matrix fibrosis (Huvenne et al. 2009; Mjösberg et al. 2011 ). In contrast, nasal polyps associated with other diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis) are associated with large numbers of neutrophils in the polyp tissue. The polyps in patients with CRSwNP exhibit a type 2 cytokine profile, with predominant expression of IL -13, IL -5, and some IL -4 (Wang et al. 2015). Activated"
20,page_20,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 20/Protocol WA40169 , Version 1Bcells produce IgE, often against Staphylococcus aureus , in association with increased mucus and chemokine production. The marked local production of IgE antibodies in patients with CRSwNP appears to be functional and involved in the regulation of chronic inflammation ( Zhang et al. 2011 ).Asthma and CRSwNP may share similar type 2 cytokine profile s, such that a substantial proportion of patients with CRSwNP exhibit comorbid asthma. In turn, a substantial proportion of patients with asthma have CRSwNP, particularly among those with more severe asthma ( Settipane 1987; Larsen 1996 ; Ragab et al. 2004 ; Pearlman et al. 2009 ; Langdon and Mullol 2016 ). Omalizumab interrupts the allergic cascade triggered by cross -linking IgE on the surface of mast cells and basophils by 1) forming complexes with IgE and preventing the arming of effector cells; 2) aiding off -loading of mast cells and basophils by trapping IgE as it dissociates from the FcRI receptor; 3)down-modulating FcRI (onmast cells, basophils, and dendritic cells) as a direct consequence of the reduction in free IgE levels; 4)reducing antigen presentation to T lymphocytes by dendritic cells; 5) reducing IgE stimulated synthesis and secretion of pr oinflammatory cytokines by human airway smooth muscle cells; and 6) improving interferon -production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( Presta et al.1993; Jardieu 1995 ; Heusser and Jardieu 1997 ; Holgate et al. 1998 ; Fick 1999 ; Jardieu and Fick 1999 ; Patalano 1999 ; Boushey 2001; Prussin et al. 2003; Roth and Tamm 2010 ;Teach et al. 2015 ). These events then result in the reduction of type 2 inflammation, including reduced production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL -13 by innate and adaptive cells. Therefore, given the multiple potential mechanisms of omalizumab in limiting the inflammation in nasal polyps, a strategy to antagonize IgE with omalizumab is likely to benefit patients with CRSwNP. The benefit of antagonizing IgE in patients with CRSwNP has also been suggested by a randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled study in patients with nasal polyps and comorbid asthma published byGevaert et al. 2013. Tw enty-four patients (nasal polyp size5) were included and randomized 2:1 to receive omalizumab or placebo for 16weeks. Twelve of the 24 patients had the diagnosis of aspirin hypersensitivity. Results showed a significant reduction from baseline in tot al nasal endoscopic polyp score in patients in the omalizumab group at Week 16 ( -2.67, p 0.001) but not in patients in the placebo group ( -0.12, p 0.99). In addition, omalizumab treatment improved computed tomography image scores; reduced symptom scores for nasal congestion, anterior rhinorrhea, loss of sense of smell, wheeze, and dyspnea; and improved QoL scores, all irrespective of the presence of allergy ( Gevaert et al. 2013 ). A number of other case -controlled and randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled studies have been performed over the past decade examining the efficacy of omalizumab for the treatment of nasal polyps ( Penn and Mikula 2007 ; Pinto et al . 2010 ; Vennera et al. 2011 ; Tajiri et al. 2013 ; Sintobin et al. 2015 ). The collective and cumulative clinical evidence strongly suggests a potential benefit of o malizumab in patients with CRSwNP."
21,page_21,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 21/Protocol WA40169 , Version 1Omalizumab is being investigated in placebo -controlled randomized clinical trials (Studies GA39688 and GA398 55), which will provide the source population for this current extension study. These studies are enrolling pati ents with difficult -to-treat CRSwNP, large bilateral nasal polyps, and substantial burden to their heath -related quality of life (HRQoL). As such, it is anticipated that patient smay potentially require longer -term treatment of their CRSwNP with a biologic medication and that the usage of such biologic medications longer than 24 weeks may be warranted in some situations. Moreover, omalizumab may be utilized longer term for the other two indications for which it is approved: allergic asthma and CIU/ CSU. There is indeed significant evidence regarding omalizumab 's longer -term safety profile, including t he Epidemiologic Study of Xolair ( Omalizumab): Evaluating Clinical Effectiveness and Long -Term Safety in Patients with Moderate- to-Severe Asthma (EXCELS) , a prospective observational cohort study of adults and adolescents with allergic asthma with a median f ollow -up of 5 years including 5007 patient s in an omalizuamb cohort and 2 829 patients in a comparator non-omalizumab cohort (Long et al. 2014 ). Thus , the studies that provid eevidence for potential effectiveness of anti-IgE therapy in CRSwNP, t he enrollment of difficult -to-treat patients with significa nt disease burden, the established safety profile of omalizumab , and omalizumab 'sfrequent longer -term usage in other indications provide evidence for the benefit risk assessment of conducting the current extension study. 2.

24,page_24,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 24/Protocol WA40169 , Version 13. STUDY DESIGN 3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY This study is an open- label clinical study. Patients who have completed the treatment period of Study GA39688 /GA39855 and fulfil lthe el igibility criteria for the open- label extension (OLE) study will be enrolled. Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before performing any study -specific tests or evaluations. Patients will then start rece iving open -label omalizumab as per the dosing schedule based on their body weight and IgE levels collected during the screening period of Study GA39688 /GA39855 (see Figure 1). Patients will also undergo assessments as shown in the schedules of activities in Appendix 1. Patients will be eligible for enrollment in the study at the W eek 24 visit of StudyGA39688/ GA39855 or within 28days after the Week 24visitof Study GA39688/GA39855. W henever possible, patients should enroll and begin open -label dosing of omalizumab at the W eek 24 visit of Study GA39688/GA39855 rather than return for a subsequent visit. However, if necessary, patients may return within 28 days of the W eek 24 visit of Study GA39688/GA39855 to enroll and begin dosing. The rationale for enrolling p atients into this OLE study at the Week 24 visit of Study GA39688/GA39855 ,or within a short period of time thereafter , isto allow for relatively continuous exposure to omalizumab over a 52- week period of time. Enrollment at the W eek 24 visit of Study GA39688/GA39855 may also reduce patient burden by obviating the need for an additional clinic visit. Informed consent into this OLE study must be completed by the time of enrollment and open -label omalizumab dosing. Whenever possible, investigato rs should begin the consent process for this OLE study well in advance of the Week 24 visit of Study GA39688/GA39855 . Providing information about this OLE study to patients early in Study GA39688/GA39855 will facilitate a seamless transition into this protocol . After enrollment into this OLE study, p atients will receive 28 weeks of dosing of open -label omalizumab before entering a 24 -week off -treatment observation phase of the study. In this protocol, t he timing of the visit schedule for this OLE study i s defined in time relative to the baseline of StudyGA39688/ GA39855 . That is, the first visit of this OLE study is referred to as the ""Week 24 Visit ."" Similarly, the last visit occurring during the 28 -week treatment phase is referred to as the ""Week52 Visit ,""and the final visit of the 24 -week follow -up period is referred to as the ""Week76 Visit. "" Note that the Week52 Visit is not only considered to be the last visit of the treatment phase, but also the first visit of the follow -up period."
25,page_25,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 25/Protocol WA40169 , Version 1The first dose of open -label omalizumab should be adminis tered on the day of enrollment into this OLE study (""Week 24 Visit ""). The dosing table will be the same as that use d with Study GA39688/ GA39855 (seeAppendix 2). Patients should remain on stable doses of intranasal corticosteroid ( CS)therapy (mometasone nasal spray 200 g twice a day [ BID] as per Sectio n4.3.3 ) for the entire treatment and follow -upperiods. That is, patients should remain on stable doses of intranasal CS therapy for both the treatment period of Study GA39688/ GA39855 , the treatment period of this current study, and the follow -up period of this current study. As in Study GA39688/ GA39855 , patients deemed by the investigator to be intolerant to a BID regimen of mometasone may remain on a stable dosage of mometasone once daily (QD)(two sprays/nostril, both nostrils, 50 g/spray QD for a total daily dosage of 200 g). Any patient transitioned to daily mometasone should remain on this regimen for the remainder of the study. Safety, efficacy, and patient -reported outcome (PRO) measures will be assessed during the treatment and follow -upperiods, as detailed in the schedule of activities (see Appendix 1). After the treatment period ends ( after Week 52Visit), patients will be followed for an additional 24weeks as part of the follow -upperiod (Appendix 1). There is no dose administered at W eek 52. During the follow -up period, patients will be asked to continue completion of their daily electronic diary ( eDiary )assessment of nasal symptoms . An important objective of this portion of this study will be to understand the extent and timing of any relapse in symptoms related to nasal polyposis. Patients will return to clinic at W eek 6 4and for a final visit at Week 76, with telephone visits at W eeks56, 60, 68, and 72. All patients who discontinue study drug early during the treatment period will be asked to complete the remain der of the treatment period and then complete the 2 4-week follow -upperiod. For example, if a patient discontinues study drug at Week 32, that patient would be asked to return for the Week 36 and Week 52 visit s to complete allassessment sand would then c omplete the follow -up visits . NPS will be assessed by video nasal endoscopy, scored using a standard scoring system (Appendix 3; maximum NPS is 8) by a central panel of independent sinus surgeons who are blinded to treatment assignment from Studies GA39688/ GA39855 and blinded to timepoint of assessment within this OLE study ( e.g.,readers will not know whether nasal endoscopy was obtained during the treatment period or the follow -up period) . A schedule of activities is provided in Appendix 1."

Thus, the open -label treatment period of this study is 28 weeks and runs from the ""Week 24 Visit"" (approximately 24 weeks after initiat ion of study drug in StudyGA39688/ GA39855 ) to the ""Week 52 Visit"" (approximately 52 weeks after initiation of study drug in Study GA39688/ GA39855 ). 3.2 END OF STUDY AND LENGTH OF STUDY The end of the study is defined as the date of the last patient 's last visit (LPLV). The LPLV is expected to occur approximately 52 weeks after the last patent is enrolled (28-week treatment period of OLE followed by 24 -week follow -up period ). 3.3 RATIONA LE FOR STUDY DESIGN 3.3.1 Rationale for Omalizumab Dose and Schedule In this study , patient weights and IgE values used to determine study drug dosing will be based only on values from the screening pe riod of Study GA39688/GA39855 (see Section 4.1.3 for further details) . Omalizumab will be dosed according to the same dosing table used in Study GA39688/GA39855 . That is, dosing will be based on a dosing table that provides at least 0.016 mg/kg for every IU/mL of IgE, within a 4-week interval (see Appendix 2). The dosing algorithm used as the basis of the dosing table is consistent with the approach used in published studies for the treatment of CRSwNP and with the approach used for the treatment of alle rgic asthma . Therange of IgE values (30 IU/mL to 1,500 IU/mL) used in the dosing table comes from the asthma E.U. SmPC dosing table . This asthma E.U .SmPC table has been modified to remove lower patient weights because this trial will include only adult patients, whereas the approved asthma E.U. SmPC table is also intended to treat pediatric patients. As with the approved E.U. SmPC table , omalizumab will be administered every 4 weeks for doses up to and including 600 mg and every 2 weeks for those patie nts requiring higher doses (see Appendix 2)."
27,page_27,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 27/Protocol WA40169 , Version 13.3.2 Rationale for Open -Label Study Design For the purposes of efficacy analyses, this st udy utilizes endpoints such as nasal blockage/congestion score (NCS) and NPS with continuous outcomes scales rather than binary event rates. These outcomes are evaluated over time, as detailed in Section 6.6, allowing an examination of the extent to which patients improve or worsen relative to a previous point in time. Inaddition, providing omalizumab to all patients in this study provides larger sample sizes for analyses such as durability of response, relative to designs such as a randomization withdrawal approach. Moreover, this open -label design will allow an examina tion of the impact of longer treatment duration on durability of response, as discussed in Section 6.5.3.1 . 4. MATERI ALS AND METHOD S 4.1 PATIENTS The study will enroll patients from the double -blind ,placebo -controlled , Phase III Study GA39688/ GA39855 who have completed study treatment. These patients may enroll in this open -label study at the Week 24 visit of StudyGA39688 orGA39855 ,or within 7 calendar days after the W eek 24 visit(see Section 3.1for further explanation ).

ASSESSMENT OF SA FETY Omalizumab is not approved for the treatment of adult patients with CRSwNP who have had an inadequate response t o standard -of-care treatments. The safety plan for patients in this study is ba sed on the extensive clinical and post marketing experience with omalizumab for the last 13 years. Omalizumab is marketed in over 90 countries for allergic asthma and 80 countries for CIU/CSU as of 31 December 201 6. The estimated cumulative omalizumab exp osure is 3 1,000 Patient -Years in clinical trials and 819,000 Patient -Years in the postmarketing setting as of 31 December 2016. The clinical safety of omalizumab has been well documented in a number of clinical trials that involve adults and children with moderate to severe allergic asthma. The adverse event profile of omalizumab observed during the clinical development program of allergic asthma was similar to placebo, with the most commonly reported adverse events being headaches and injection site reactions, including injection site pain, swelling, erythema, pruritus. Anaphylactic reactions were observed but were rare and typically occurred within 2 hours of the first injection. The overall adverse event profile in CIU/CSU studies"
41,page_41,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 41/Protocol WA40169 , Version 1was consistent with t he known safety profile of omalizumab . Omalizumab has also been investigated in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, perennial allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and peanut allergy. The safety profile of omalizumab in non -asthma trials has not di ffered from the safety profile of omalizumab in asthma trials. The Sponsor does not anticipate a difference in the safety profile of omalizumab in the population with nasal polyps from the existing safety profile in asthma and CIU/CSU where the safety pro file of the molecule is already well defined. No specific safety concerns were identified in the published literature for the similar indication and study population with omalizumab. 5.1 SAFETY PLA N The anticipated important safety risks for omalizumab are ou tlined below. Please refer to the omalizumab Investigator 's Brochure for a complete summary of safety information. Several measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this study . Eligibility criteria have been designed to ex clude patients at higher risk for toxicities. Patients will undergo safety monitoring during the study, including assessment of the nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events. In addition, guidelines for managing adverse events, including criteria for treatment interruption or discontinuation ,is provided appropriately (see Section 4.6). 5.1.1 Safety and Data Monitoring All safety events will be closely monitored by the study team. The sponsor followed the U.S. FDA guidance ( FDA 2006 ) to evaluate the need for an independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) and decided not to have an iDMC for this study based on the criteria mentioned in the guidance. Given the established safety record of omalizumab, the nature of nasal polyposis, and the outcomes being examined, an iDMC is not indicated in this study. 5.1.2 Anaphy laxis A djudication Committee All potential anaphylaxis cases reported by investigators to the Sponsor will be subsequently submitte d for adjudication to a blinded three- member anaphylaxis adjudication committee composed of external experts in allergic diseases . The committee will assess whether the reported event is a true anaphylaxis event (based on Sampson' s criteria; see Appendix 12) and whether the reported anaphylaxis event is causally related to study drug . Further details will be provided in the Anaphylaxis Adjudication Charter. 5.1.3 Risks A ssociated with Omalizumab 5.1.3.1 Anaphy laxis Anaphylaxis has been reported to occur after administration of omalizumab in clinical trials and in postmarketing spontaneous reports. Anaphylactic reactions were rare in clinical trials (0.1%) and estimated as 0. 2% from post marketing reporting . The reported"
42,page_42,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 42/Protocol WA40169 , Version 1signs and symptoms included, but were not limited to ,bronchospasm, hypotension, syncope, urticaria, and/or angioedema of the throat or tongue. Some of these events have been reported as lifethreatening . The majority of anaphylactic -type reactions have been reported to occur after the firstdose ,with numbers decreasing with subseque nt doses , but such reactions were also reported beyond 1 year after starting scheduled treatment. The events were reported to occur predominantly within the first 2 hours post -dose,with few reports occurring as far as 36 hours post -dose. Details regarding management of these events are provided below: Administer omalizumab only in a healthcare setting by healthcare providers prepared to manage anaphylaxis that can be life -threatening ;medications for the treatment of anaphylactic reactions should be available for immediate use following administration of omalizumab. Patients should be observed for at least 2 hours after the first 3 study drug doses , within this OLE study, and at least 30 minutes after subsequent doses. However, some patients may require longer observation periods, depending on investigator judgment taking into account the time to onset of anaphylaxis seen in clinical trials and postmarketing spontaneous reports . The American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology guideline on the observation period after omalizumab administr ation ( Kimetal. 2010 )recommends 2 hours of monitoring in the clinic after the first three injections and 30 minutes or an appropriate time agreed upon by the individual patient and healthcare professional for subsequent injections. However, a delayed onset of symptoms and protracted progression of anaphylaxis should be taken into account when administering omalizumab ( Limb et al. 2007 ). Inform pati ents of the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis, and instruct them to seek immediate medical care should signs or symptoms occur. Discontinue omalizumab in patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reaction . 5.1.3.2 Serum Sickness Serum sickness and serum sickness like reactions, which are delayed allergic type III reactions, have rarely been seen in patients treated with humanized monoclonal antibodies i ncluding omalizumab in the post -approval use. The onset has typically been 15days after administration of the first or subsequent injections, also after long duration of treatment. Symptoms suggestive of serum sickness include arthritis/arthralgia, rash (urticaria or other forms), fever ,and lymphadenopathy. Antihistamines and cortico steroids may be useful for preventing or treating this disorder. Patients should be informed and advised to report any suspected symptoms of serum sickness like reactions . Physicians should stop omalizumab if a patient develops this constellation of signs and symptoms."
43,page_43,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 43/Protocol WA40169 , Version 15.1.3.3 Churg- Strauss Syndrome and H ypereosinophilic Syndrome Patients with severe asthma may rarely present systemic hypereosinophilic syndrome or allergic eosinophilic granulomatous vasculitis (Churg -Strauss syndrome), both of which are usually t reated with systemic corticosteroids. In rare cases, patients on therapy with anti-asthma medicinal products, including omalizumab, may present or develop systemic eosinophilia and vasculitis. These events are commonly associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy and alerted to the development of marked eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, paranasal sinus abnormalities, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy. Abrupt discontinuation of systemic or inhaled corticos teroids after initiation of omalizumab therapy is not recommended. Decreases in corticosteroids should be performed under the direct supervision of a physician and may need to be performed gradually. Patients with known or suspected Churg -Strauss syndrom eshould be excluded from the study. 5.1.3.4 Thrombocytopenia In nonclinical studies, a dose -dependent and reversible circulating platelet reduction was observed. In clinical studies, few patients experienced platelet counts below the lower limitof the normal laboratory range. None of these changes was associated with bleeding episodes or a decrease in hemoglobin. 5.1.3.5 Malignancies During initial clinical trials in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with allergic asthma, there was a n umerical imbalance in cancers arisin g in the active treatment group compared with the control group. The number of observed cases was uncommon ( 1/100) in both the active and the control group. In a subsequent observational study (EXCELS) comparing 5007 omalizumab -treated patients and 2829 non- omalizumab -treated patients followed for up to 5 years, the incidence rates of primary malignancies per 1000 patient years were 16.01 (295/18 ,426 patient yea rs) and 19.07 (190/9963 patient years), respectively, whi ch does not indicate an increased malignancy risk (rate ratio 0.84, 95% CI:0.621.13). In a further analysis of randomized double -blind placebo -controlled clinical trials ,including 4254 patients on omalizumab and 3178 patients on placebo, omalizumab treatment was not associated with an increased malignancy risk based on incidence rates per 1000 patient years of 4.14 (14/3382 patient years) for omalizumab -treated patients and 4.45 (11/2474 patient years) for placebo patients (rate ratio 0.93, 95% CI:0.392.27). The overall observed incidence rate of malignancy in the omalizumab clinical trial program was comparable to that reported in the general population. There were no cases of malignancy in clinical trials in allergic asthma in the 6 to12years -of-age group with omalizumab; there were 2cases of malignancy in the control group (medulloblastoma and nephroblastoma). In the Phase III C IU/CSU program (733 patients enrolled and recei ving at least 1 dose of omalizumab , including 684 patients exposed fo r 12 weeks and 427 exposed for"
44,page_44,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 44/Protocol WA40169 , Version 124weeks ),there was 1case of malignancy in the placebo group (242 patients) and 1case in the omalizumab 300-mg group (412 patients) in a patient with a preexisting history. 5.1.3.6 Arterial Thrombotic Events In controlled clinical trials in allergic asthma and during interim analyses of EXCELS (an observational study ), a numerical imbalance of arterial thrombotic events ( ATEs) was observed. ATEsincluded stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, an d cardiovascular death (including death from unknown cause). Theresults from EXCELS revealed the rate of ATE sper 1, 000 patient years was 7.52 (115/1 5,286 patient years) for omalizumab- treated patients and 5.12 (51/9 ,963patient years) for control patients. Although there was no consistent evidence of an association between omalizumab use and risk of ATEs, the 95% CIs were wide and could not definitively exclude an elevated risk. 5.1.3.7 Antibody Formation to O malizumab Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal anti -IgE antibody .The formation of anti-omalizumab antibodies (also called ADAs) after omalizumab administration is a rare event. There were 3 ADA- positive cases out of 23,375 serum samples tested in the Allergic Asthma and C SU/CIU programs following omalizumab administration . These cases were not associated with any severe adverse events . There was no case of drug- induced A DAs recorded across the en tire CSU/CIU development program. 5.1.4 Management of Patients Who Experience Specific A dverse Events 5.1.4.1 Dose Modifications and Treatment Interruption No dose modification or treatment interruption is allowed during the conduct of the study. Omalizumab should be discontinued in patients who experience a severe hypersensitivity reactio n. 5.1.4.2 Management of Drug Induced Liver Injuries Liver injury has not been described as a risk associated with omalizumab. However, 1) if the patient's AST or ALT is 8upper limit of normal ( ULN), or 2) if the patient's A ST or ALT 3ULN and total bilirubin 2ULN or clinical jaundice occurs, study drug should be discontinued, liver test should be repeated, and an evaluation for causes for the liver test abnormality should be initiated. 5.2 SAFETY PA RAMETERS A ND DEFINITIONS Safety assessments will cons ist of monitoring and recording adverse events (including serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest ), performing protocol -specified safety laboratory assessments, measuring protocol -specified vital"
45,page_45,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 45/Protocol WA40169 , Version 1signs, and conducting other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study. Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in Section 5.2.2 . 5.2.1 Adverse Events According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution. An adverse event can therefore be any of the following: Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in Section 5.3.5.11 . Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation from study drug Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those that occur pri or to assignment of study treatment (e.g., nasal endoscopy ) 5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor) A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria: Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at immediate risk of death) This does not include any adverse event that ,had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to cont inue,might have caused death. Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.12) Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event results in substantial disruption of the patient 's ability to conduct normal life functions) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to study drug"
46,page_46,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 46/Protocol WA40169 , Version 1Is a significant medical event in the investigator 's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes listed above) The terms ""severe"" and ""serious"" are notsynonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache without any further findings). Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event recorded on the eCRF. Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). 5.2.3 Adverse Events of Special Inte rest (Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor) Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instruction s). Adverse events of special interest for this study are as follows: Suspected anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions identified based on Sampson 's criteria (see Appendix 12) Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy'sLaw (see Section 5.3.5.8 ) Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study drug, as defined below : Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion p rotein transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product. This term applies only when a contamination of the study drug is suspected."
47,page_47,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 47/Protocol WA40169 , Version 15.3 METHODS A ND TIMING F OR CA PTURING A ND ASSESSING SAFETY PARAMETERS The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections 5.45.6. For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ). 5.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Peri od Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact. All adverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by study personnel, will be recorded in the patient 's medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. After inform ed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported (seeSection 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events). After initiation of study drug, all adverse events will be reported until the end of the safety follow -up period (W eek 76 ). Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting period are provided in Section 5.6. 5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints. Examples of non -directive questions include the following: ""How have you felt since your last clinic visit?"" ""Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?"" 5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of A dverse Events Table 2 will be used for assessing severity of adverse events. Table 2Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale Severity Description Mild Discomfort noticed, but no disruption of normal daily activity Moderate Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity Severe Incapacitating with inability to work or to perform normal daily activity Note: Regardless of severity, some events may also meet seriousness criteria. Refer to definition of a serious adverse event (see Section 5.2.2 )."
48,page_48,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 48/Protocol WA40169 , Version 15.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating ""yes"" or ""no"" accordingly. The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also Table 3 ): Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (as applicable) Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments Known association of the event with the disease under study Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to increase the occurrence of the event Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the occurrence of the event Table 3 C ausal A ttribution Guidance Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by the study drug on the basis of facts, evidence, science -based rationales, and clinical judgment? YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and administrati on of the study drug, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by the patient 's clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the adverse even t abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge. NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below . Evidence exists that the adve rse event has an etiology other than the study drug (e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, orconcomitant medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after firstdose of study drug). For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for each protocol -mandated therapy. 5.3.5 Procedures for Recording A dverse Events Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF."
49,page_49,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 49/Protocol WA40169 , Version 15.3.5.1 Injection- Site Reactions Local adverse events that occur during (or within 24 hours )after study drug administration and are judged to be related to study drug injection should be captured as a diagnosis (e.g., ""injection -site reaction"" on the Adverse Event eCRF) . Associated signs and symptoms should be recorded on the dedicated Injection- SiteReaction eCRF. If a patient experiences both a local and systemic reaction to the same dose of study drug, each reaction should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs and symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated Injection -Site Reaction eCRF. 5.3.5.2 Anaphy lactic Reactions The i nvestigator should use Sampson 's criteria ( Appendix 12) to identify the potential cases o f anaphylaxis and report as a diagnosis on the Adverse Event eCRF. If possible, avoid ambiguous terms such as ""systemic reaction."" Any case of known or suspected anaphylaxis will require the completion of a dedicated eCRF to record the specific signs and symptoms associated with this event. 5.3.5.3 Diagnosis vers us Signs and Sy mptoms Adiagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a c onstellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previou sly reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by one adverse event report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 5.3.5.4 Adverse Events That A reSecondary to Other Events In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious secondary events . A medically significant secondary adverse event that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF. For example: If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be reported separately on the eCRF."
50,page_50,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 50/Protocol WA40169 , Version 1If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. All ad verse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is unclear as to whether the events are associated. 5.3.5.5 Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation timepoints. Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF. The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be recorded at the time the event is first reported. If a persistent adverse event becomes more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Sectio n5.4.2for reporting instructions). The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated bychanging the event from ""non -serious"" to ""serious,"" providing the date that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events. A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.3.5.6 Abnormal Laboratory Values Not every laboratory abnorm ality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: Is accompanied by clinical symptoms Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a change in concomitant therapy Is clinically significant in the investigator 's judgment It is the investigator 's responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., ALP and bilirubin 5 upper limit of normal [ ULN]associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., ""elevated potassium,"" as opposed to ""abnormal potassium""). If the laboratory"
51,page_51,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 51/Protocol WA40169 , Version 1abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as ""hyperkalemia."" Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.5 for details on recording persistent adverse events). 5.3.5.7 Abnormal Vital Sign Values Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: Is accompanied by clinical symptoms Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., d osage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy Is clinically significant in the investigator 's judgment It is the investigator 's responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.5 for details on recording persistent adverse events). 5.3.5.8 Abnormal Liver Function Tests The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3ULN) in combination with either an elevated total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (asdefined by Hy 's Law). Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the following: Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with total bilirubin 2ULN Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with clinical jaundice The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.3) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of"
52,page_52,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 52/Protocol WA40169 , Version 1the event), either as a serious adverse event or an adverse event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2). 5.3.5.9 Deaths All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1 ), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2). Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event shoul d be reported. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, ""unexplained death"" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), ""unexplained death"" should be replaced by the established cause of death. The term ""sudden death"" should not be used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., ""sudden cardiac death""). Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as described in Section 5.6. 5.3.5.10 Preexisting Medical Conditions A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eC RF. A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. W hen recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., ""more frequent headaches""). 5.3.5.11 Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Nasal Polyposis Medical occurrences or symptoms of deterioration that are anticipated as part of nasal polyp osisshould be recorded as an adverse event if judged by the investigator to have unexpectedly worsened in severity or frequency or changed in nature at any time during the study. When recording an unanticipated worsening of nasal polyposis on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., "" worsening of nasal polyposis as compared to baseline"" ). 5.3.5.12 Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization Any adverse event that result s in hospitalization (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospital) or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse"
53,page_53,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 53/Protocol WA40169 , Version 1event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 ), except as outlined below. An event th at leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances should not be reported as an adverse event or a serious adverse event : Hospitalization for respite care Planned hospitalization required by the protocol if required by site (e.g., for study drug administration or nasal endoscopy) Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria are met: The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the study when elective surgery became necessary because of the expected normal progression of the disease . The patient has not experienced an adverse event . An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances is not considered to be a serious adverse event, but should be reported as an adverse event instead: Hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient care outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours 5.3.5.13 Adverse Events A ssociated with an Overdose or Error in Drug Administration An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the dose being studied. An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event. All adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., nomore than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). 5.3.5.14 Patient -Reported Outcome Data Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data by the Sponsor, and safety analyses will not be performed using PRO data. However, if any PRO respons es suggestive of a possible adverse event are identified during site review of the PRO data, the investigator will determine whether the criteria for an adverse event have been met and, if so, will report the event on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.4 IMMEDIA TE REPO RTING REQUIREMENTS F ROM INVESTIGA TOR TO SPON SOR Certain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial.

A Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators. Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. The investigator should discontinue study drug and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. Any serious adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. In addition , the"

Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial -related procedures until a final outcome can be reported. During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient 's medical record to facilitate source data verification. All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pre gnancy outcome. 5.5.2 Sponsor Follow -Up For serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, and pregnancies, the Sponsor or a designee may follow up by telephone, fax, email, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome inf ormation (e.g., from hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case. 5.6 ADVERSE EVENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER THE ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING PERI OD The Sponsor should be not ified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious adverse event that occurs after the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as study completion date ), if the event is believed to be related to prior study drug treatment.

To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will assess the expectedness of these events using the following reference document : Omalizumab Investigator 's Brochure The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator 's assessment of causa lity and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed. 6. STATISTICA L CONSIDERA TIONS AND ANAL YSIS PLA N The analysis of complete data from the study, including data from the safety follow -up period will be performed when all patients have either discontinued the study early or completed the safety follow -up period, all data from the study are in the database, and the database is cleaned and locked. Detailed specifications of the statistical methods will be described in the Statistical Ana lysis Plan (SAP). The SAP may be reviewed by health authorities and will be finalized prior to database lock. To allow for incorporation of health authority input, the statistical methods in the SAP may differ from and will supersede those described in t his document. Throughout this Section the term ""descriptive statistics ""is defined as follows, unless otherwise noted: For continuous variables descriptive statistics will include at a minimum: number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. For categorical variables descriptive statistics will include at a minimum: number of patients and percentage of patients. 6.1 DETERMINA TION OF SA MPLE SIZE No formal sample size calculation was performed for this study because the primar y analysis is descriptive in nature, there will be no formal hypothesis testing, and this study is an OLE of previous studies (Studies GA39688 andGA39 855), which plan to enroll approximately 240patients in total (120 patients each) . In order to be eligi ble for"
58,page_58,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 58/Protocol WA40169 , Version 1enrollment into this study, the patient must complete assessments at W eek 24 in the prior study without discontinuation of study drug. Therefore, due to the inclusion criteria of this study and potential dropout from Studies GA39688 andGA39855 , the sample size of approximately 240 patients is a maximum. 6.2 ANAL YSIS COHORTS The study population will consist of two cohorts: Cohort A: Study participants who have completed Study GA39688 grouped according to treatment randomized in Study GA39688 (omalizu mab or placebo) and who have enrolled into the current study Cohort B: Study participants who have completed Study GA39855 grouped according to treatment randomized in Study GA39855 (omalizumab or placebo) and who have enrolled into the current study 6.3 SUMM ARIES OF TREA TMENT GROUP AND COHORT COMPA RABILITY The two previous studies (GA39688 and GA39855) from which the current study population is drawn are planned to be identical with respect to all design considerations including: Geographic regions (North Am erica, ex -North America) Schedule of assessments Inclusion/ exclusion criteria Treatment regimen based on the omalizumab dosing table ( see Appendix 2) Therefore ,baseline characteristics, study conditions, and treatment regimen characteristics are expected to be similar between the two trials as characterized by: Number of injections received Number of patients in each dosing schedule (e.g. , Q2W, Q4W) Relative dos e intensity (e.g. ,the amount of study drug administered divided by the amount of study drug planned) To ensure compar ability of study treatment , Cohorts A and Cohort Bbaseline characteristics (e.g. ,age, sex, race/ethnicity, NPS, NCS, sense of smell, an terior rhinorrhea, posterior rhinorrhea, and SNOT -22) will be summarized in all patients with data using descriptive statistics both by cohort and by previously -randomized treatment group within cohort (omalizumab and placebo). Prior study treatment chara cteristics will be compared by descriptive statistics across cohorts (e.g. ,omalizumab from Cohort A with omalizumab from Cohort B) to control for potential confounding of different early withdrawal rates by treatment groups. Baseline disease characterist ics for each cohort (e.g.,NCS, NPS, SNOT -22,etc.) will be defined as the last measurement prior to randomization in the previous study (GA39688 ,GA39855)."
59,page_59,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 59/Protocol WA40169 , Version 16.4 SUMMA RIES OFCONDUCT OFSTUDY Descriptive statistics will be used to evaluate the conduct of the study. The number of patients enrolled will be tabulated by study site and bytreatment randomized (omalizumab or placebo) in the previous study in all patients with data. Patient disposition (the number of patients enrolled, treated, and completing each study period) will be tabulated by cohort (and pooled cohorts) by treatment randomized (omalizumab or placebo) in the previous study in all patients with data. Premature study drug discontinuation and study discontinuation, as well as reasons for discont inuations ,will be summarized. Eligibility criteria deviations and other major protocol deviations will be summarized. 6.5 EFFICA CY ANAL YSES All efficacy analyses for this study will be presented by cohort and by treatment group (four groups : [1] Cohort A omalizumab, [2] Cohort A placebo, [3] Cohort B omalizumab, [4] Cohort B placebo ). In addition, i f no meaningful differences exist between cohorts with respect to the comparisons outlined in Section 6.3,and if efficacy results from Studies GA39688 andGA3985 5appear consistent, the cohorts will be pooled for all efficacy analyses (two groups: [1] Cohorts A and B omalizumab , [2] Cohorts A andB placebo) in addition to being presented separately . In all efficacy analyses, baseline will be defined as the last m easurement from previous studies taken prior to randomization (i.e., baseline of Study GA39688 or GA39855). This definition of baseline is deemed the most meaningful because it allows for comparison of treatment regimens (i.e., 52 weeks of omalizumab treatment vs. 24 weeks of placebo followed by 28 weeks of omalizumab treatment). It also allows for a graphical assessment of the trajectory of the endpoint over the entire course of a 52 -week treatment period (over the course of the current and previous stud ies) in both treatment groups. Assuming that omalizumab is beneficial as compared to placebo, it is expected that the distribution of continuous endpoints (e.g., NCS, NPS, etc.) at W eek 24 (the beginning of this study) will meaningfully differ between the omalizumab and placebo groups. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to define baseline as the measurement taken at Week 24. 6.5.1 Efficacy Analysis Populations All efficacy analyses will be based on the full analysis set of the OLE study (FAS -OLE), consisting of all patients enrolled into this OLE grouped according to the treatment assigned (omalizumab or placebo) at randomization of the previous studies. 6.5.2 Primary Efficacy Endpoint s Because the primary analysis is descriptive in nature, there will be no formal hypothesis testing in the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoints ."

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 60/Protocol WA40169 , Version 16.5.2.1 Nasal Poly p Score Polyp size in each nasal opening will be graded through an assessment of the video nasal endoscopy (0 4 integer scale, seeAppendix 3; Gevaert et al. 2013 ) by a central panel of independent sinus surgeons who are blinded to treatment assignment in the previous studies . NPS is the sum of the polyp scores in both nostrils (maximum score of8). For patients who have had a relati vely common surgical procedure called middle turbinectomy, scoring will be modified (see Appendix 3). In addition to all timepoints through W eek 24 of the previous study, in this OLE study NPS will be assess ed on Weeks 36, 52, 64, and 76. Baseline NPS is defined as the last measurement from the previous study performed before randomization (i.e.,baseline of Study GA39688/ GA39855 ). The absolute change from baseline NPS values will be defined as the NPS at the timepoint minus the NPS at baseline. Change from baseline of Study GA39688/ GA39855 in NPS will be summarized at each timepoint by descriptive statistics on observed data (i.e. ,mean, median, standard deviation ,and 95% CIs) by treatment group from Study GA39688/ GA39855 . Both efficacy and durability of response will be assessed descriptively and graphically , within patients enrolled in the OLE and randomized to omalizumab in Study GA39688/ GA39855 ,according to the mean estimates of absolute change fro m baseline in NPS over all timepoints thr ough Week 76, including data from timepoints from the previous studies. In addition, t he durability of response will be assessed ,by treatment gro up from Study GA39688/ GA39855 ,by descriptive analysis of the change from baseline at Weeks52, 64,and 76 in NPS. The duration of response will be assessed in each arm separately as the last timepoint at which a meaningful change f rom baseline in NPS is present . 6.5.2.2 Nasal Congestion Score NCS will be scored by patients as not at all, mild, moderate, or s evere (a score of 0, 1, 2, or3, respectively; seeAppendix 4; Fairley et al. 1993 ) every morning through W eek76 via eDiary. Details on the calculation of the average daily NCS (i.e., number of days included) at baseline and at each timepoint will be provided in the SAP. In addition to monthly timepoints through W eek 24 of the previous studies (from patients enrolled in the OLE) , for each patient and monthly study timepoint of the OLE study (i.e., Weeks 52, 56, 60, 64, 68 , 72, and 76), the NCS for that study visit will be defined as the average of the daily scores leading up to that timepoint. The absolute change from baseline in the average daily NCS values will be defined as the average NCS at the timepoint minus the average daily NCS at baseline, where baseline is defined as the average of the daily NCS over the period leading up to randomization . Through ongoing monitoring of eDiary compliance, investigators will aim to obtain at least 4 of the 7 days of data for NCS in any given week."

The duration of response will be assessed in each arm separately as the last timepoint at which a meaningful change from baseline in NCS is present. 6.5.3 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 6.5.3.1 Nasal Poly p Score and Nasal Congestion Score The impact of longer treatment duration on durability of response according to NPS and NCS will be assessed separately using two mixed- effect model repeated measurement (MMRM) models for NPS and NCS as dependent variables ,respectiv ely. The models will use absolute change from baseline of Study GA39688/ GA39855 as the dependent variable, adjusted by geographic region through the use of a categorical variable and by baseline asthma comorbidity and aspirin sensitivity status, as well as timepoint ( at a minimum the model will include Weeks24, 36, 52, 64, and 76), Study GA39688/ GA39855 baseline NPS (or NCS ,respectively), treatment, treatment by timepoint interaction, and Study GA39688/ GA39855 baseline NPS (or NCS ,respectively) by timepoint interact ion. Further details about the model and additional covariates will be described in the SAP. Point es timates, 95% CIs, and p -values for the treatment effect (omalizumab vs. placebo) on absolute change from Study GA39688/ GA39855 baseline in NPS (or NCS , respectively) will be calculated on the basis of the model for all modeled timepoints , including Week 76, using appropriate contrasts. The SAP will describe adjustments , if any, for potential unspecified confounders of treatment group differences due to the fact that enrollment into the OLE occurs post-randomization into the previous studies . 6.5.3.2 Nasal Sy mptoms Nasal symptoms other than NCS (i.e. ,TNSS, loss of smell, posterior rhinorrhea, and anterior rhinorrhea) will be analyzed according tothe same methods as those used for NCS score specified in Section 6.5.2.2 and using separate MMRM models asspecified above."

Further details on the analysis of reduction in need for surgery, requirement of rescue treatment, having had surgery for nasal polyps, MOS Sleep Scale, Healthy Days Core Module, as well as the PGIC will be described in the SAP. 6.6 SAFETY ANAL YSES All safety analyses will be based on the subset of the full analysis set of the OLE study (FAS -OLE) who received at least one dose of omalizumab grouped according to the treatment assigned (omalizumab or placebo) at randomization of the previous studies. Safety will be assessed through the summary ofexposure to study drug, adverse events , andlaboratory test results. Exposure to omalizumab (number of omalizumab administrations and duration of treatment) will be summarized for the OLE by treatment group assigned (omalizumab or placebo) at randomization of the previous studies . 6.6.1 Primary Safety Analysis : Adverse Events Verbatim descriptions of treatment -emergent adverse events will be coded and their incidence will be summarized. A treatment -emergent adverse event is defined as any new adverse event reported or any worsening of an existing condi tion on or after the firstdose of study drug. Only adverse events that occurred during the OLE will be summarized. In addition, separate summaries will be generated for serious adverse events, deaths, adverse events of special interest as defined in Section 5.2.3 , and adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug. 6.6.2 Secondary Safety Analysis: Clinical Laboratory Evaluations Descriptive summaries of laboratory values at Study GA39688/ GA39855 baseline and throughout the study will be generated for selected parameters. For these selected parameters, changes from baseline and the proportion of patients experiencing clinically significant changes relative to baseline will be com pared between treatment groups as randomized in the previous studies."

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 63/Protocol WA40169 , Version 16.7 PHA RMA COKINETIC /PHA RMA CODYNA MIC ANAL YSES Predose serum omalizumab concentrations (C min) and total and free IgE will be measured at Week 36 and Week 52 during the treatment period and at Weeks 64 and76 during the follow -up period according to the summary of activities ( Appendix 1). These concentrations will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, median , minimum, and maximum) by time point based on the safety analysis population. Additional PK analyses will be conducted as appropriate. 6.8 INTERIM A NALYSIS TheSponsor may choose to conduct one interim analysis depending on the results of Study GA39688 or GA39855 (e.g.,if time to maximum efficacy has not plateaued by Week 24). Results from this interim analysis may be used to support a marketing application with health authorities based on results from the previous Study GA39688/ GA39855 . The decision to conduct the optional interim analysis, along with the rationale, timing, and statistical details for the analysis, will be documented in the SAP prior to the conduct of the interim analysis. The interim analysis will be performed and inte rpreted by members of the Sponsor study team and appropriate senior management personnel , who will be unblinded at the treatment group level. Access to treatment assignment information will follow the Sponsor 's standard procedures. Any optional interim a nalysis will be performed after database lock of the previous studies ( Studies GA39688/ GA39855 ). In this situation, investigators will remain blinded to individual treatment assignment from the previous studies (Studies GA39688/ GA39855 ). 6.9 MISSING DA TA Unless otherwise noted, in the analysis of all continuous co- primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints, missing values will not be explicitly imputed in the analyses , which will be based on descriptive statistics for the co-primary efficacy endpoints and on mixed -effect model repeated measurement (MMRM) models for the secondary efficacy endpoints. Patients without post -baseline efficacy endpoint data will not contribute to the MMRM models. 6.10 UNUSED A ND SPURIOUS DATA For the efficacy analysis of continuous co-primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints, a single data point will be assigned to a planned timepoint (e.g. ,Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, 36, 52, 64, and 76) according to the Schedule of Activities for that particular endpoint (see Appendix 1) based on the proximity of the date of the assessment to the planned timepoint and may include data collected as part of a planned, unscheduled, safety follow -up, dosing termination, or early termination visit. All data points collected but not assigned to a planned ti mepoint in the analysis will be unused in the planned"

Further details on the assignment of data points to planned timepoints for analysis will be described in the SAP. Due to the nature of the data capture instruments (e.g. ,eCRF, eDiary ,or tab let), spurious response data is not expected for PRO efficacy endpoints. In the event of a documented device malfunction leading to spurious data (i.e. ,a date that is recorded prior to the date of first patient screened or after last patient 's last visit ),those data will be ignored (assumed missing) for the purpose of efficacy analysis and discussed in the Clinical Study Report (CSR). Any spurious lab values or vital sign measurements will be excluded from summary tables and discussed in the CSR. 7. DATA COLLECTION A ND MA NAGEMENT 7.1 DATA QUA LITY ASSURA NCE The Sponsor will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality checking of the data. Data entered manually will be collected via EDC through use of eCRFs. Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system. In the event of discrepant data, the Sponsor will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. The Sponsor will produce an EDC Study Specification document that describes the quality checking to be performed on the data. Central laboratory , central imaging, eDiary/ePRO, and I WRSdata will be sent directly to the Sponsor, using the Sponsor 's standard procedure s to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data. eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system 's audit trail. System backups for data stored by the Sponsor and records retention for the study data will be consistent withthe Sponsor 's standard procedures. Some PRO data will be collected through the use of an electronic device provided by a vendor (see Section 7.3for details ). Some data from patient assessments will be collected on paper andentered into the EDC syst em by site staff. 7.2 ELECTRONIC CA SE REPO RT FORMS eCRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -designated EDC system. Sites will receive t raining and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion. eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in accordance with instructions from the Sponsor . All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff. eCRFs should be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee."
65,page_65,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 65/Protocol WA40169 , Version 1At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a readable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records. Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is required. 7.3 ELECTRONIC PA TIENT -REPORTED OUTCOME Patients will use an electronic device to capture PRO data. The device is designed for entry of data in a way that is attributable, secure, and accurate, in compliance with U.S. FDA regulations for electr onic records (21 CFR Part 11). The data will be transmitted to a centralized database maintained by the electronic device vendor. Theelectronic data will be available for view access only ,via a secure web server . Only identified and trained users may view the data, and their actions will become part of the audit trail. The Sponsor will have view access only. System backups for data stored by the Sponsor and records retention for the study data will be consistent with the Sponsor 's standard procedures. Once the study is complete, the data, audit trail, and trial and system documentation will be archived. The investigator will receive patient data for the site in both human -and machine- readable formats on an archival -quality compact disc that must be kept with the study records as source data. Acknowl edgement of receipt of the compact disc is required. In addition, the Sponsor will receive all data in a machine -readable format on a compact disc. 7.4 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification and review to confir m that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and doc umented for the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, PROs , evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico- technical departments involved in a clinical trial. Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan. This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or el ectronic record of the data) and considered source data."
66,page_66,"Omalizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 66/Protocol WA40169 , Version 1Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of rec ords described in Section 7.6. To facilitate source data verification and review , the investigators and institutions must provide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial-related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review. The study site must also allow inspection by applicable health authorities. 7.5 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site's computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the person making the change, and date of the change. 7.6 RETENTION OF RECORDS Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of IMP, including eCRFs, electronic or paper PRO data (if applicable), Informed Consent Forms, laboratory test results, and medication invento ry records, must be retained by the Principal Investigator for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study or for the length of time required by relevant national or local health authorities, whichever is longer. After that period o f time, the documents may be destroyed, subject to local regulations. No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor . Written notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to another party or moving them to another location. 8.
