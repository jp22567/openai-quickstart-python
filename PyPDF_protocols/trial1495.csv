9,page_9,"Novartis Confidential Page 10 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 0 2)Clean Version Protocol No. CQVM149B2303 Amendment 2 Amendment rationale The assumptions for CQVM149B2303 key secondary endpoint, Asthma Control Questionnaire -7 (ACQ -7) treatment difference, were originall y based on data from CQMF149A2210. In study CQMF149A2210, the observed mean difference after 12 weeks of treatment (indacaterol acetate andmometasone furoate (QMF) combination therapy versus mometasone furoate (MF)monotherap y) was -0.21 with 95% confidence interval (-0.28, - 0.15). Based on the upper limit of the confidence interval, a treatment difference of -0.15 was chosen as a conservative estimate, which was used to determine the sample size of CQVM149B2303. However, upon recent evaluation of the treatment difference of CQMF149A2210, it was decided to adopt an ACQ -7 treatment difference of -0.18. This treatment difference isthe upper limit of the one-sided 80% confidence interval and more appropriatel y reflects the expected improvement in ACQ - 7 for the patient population of CQVM149B2303. Reflecting the revised assumptions, the sample size re-estimation has allowed for a reduction from 1000 to approximately 750 patients.

11,page_11,"Novartis Confidential Page 12 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 0 2)Clean Version Protocol No. CQVM149B2303 Summary of amendments issued before this amendment: Amendment 1 Amendment rational e 1.Adjust the approach to asthma worsening eDiary alerts during the Run-inepoch (Section 6.4.8). Currently , it is stated in the protocol, that if an asthma worsenin g alert is observed during the Run-inepoch, the patients must be discontinued regardless of clinic al context and investigator judgment. This protocol amendment will allow investigators to use their discretion in determining the clinical significance of asthma worsening e Diary alerts during the Run-inepoch . This will allow the investigator to make the most appropriat e decision as to whether patients may continue in the study or be discontinued. If asthma worsening alert is confirmed as clinically significant by the investigator, patients should be discon tinued. A combination of eDiary alerts and investigator judgment will help ensure that the most appropriate patients are enrolled in the study, while maintaining rigorous monitoring and assessment of patient safet y. 2.Provide additional opportunity for patient s to achieve reversibility . This includes a change to the text to allow spacer use for reversibility testing as well as increasing the time period for historical reversibility from 1 y ear to 2 y ears. 3.Provide more clarit y invarious sections of theprotocol toaddress queries raised by various countries and health auth orities. Changes to the protocol Changes to specific sections of the protocol are shown in the track changes version of the protocol using strike through red font for deletions and red underlined for insertions. The described changes pertaining to the aforeme ntioned amendment rationale are implemented throughout the protocol. In addition, the following clarifications/additions are included in this protocol amendment: Updated “Other Secondary Objectives” for exacerbations to retain only the highest level endpoints ( Section 2.3 ). Refer ence to GINA 2015 guidelines updated to GINA 2016 guidelines (Section 1.1, Section 3.1 , Section 3.6, i nclusion criteri on7 in Section 4.1, andexclusion criteri on 20 in Section 4.2) to allow repeat spirometry retest at both Visit 101 and 102, modif ied timing for reversibility and modif iedthe use of historical reversibility from 1 y ear to 2 years. Added clarification to inclusion criterion 7 that if patient fails spirometry repeatabilit y at Visit 102, patient can be re-screen ed(Section 4.1 ). Specified “severe” narcolepsy and/or insomnia in e xclusion criteri on 24 (Section 4.2). Clarified s pacer devices not permitted “for rescue medication” in exclusion criterion 28 (Section 4.2), however spacer devices are only permitted during reversibility testing based on investigator discretion ( inclusion criteri on 8, Section 4.1). Adjusted wording from “c ompletion” to “stopping” in exclusion criteri on33(Section 4.2)."

This amendment will allow the investigator to incorporate clinical judgment into the context of eDiary alerts during Run -inepoch to assess clinical significance of the asthma worsening alert and decide on best course of action and the treat ment for patient . Align edSection 9 with the statistical anal ysis plan. An opportunity was also taken to make smaller changes such as some minor editorial changes that include correction of ty pographical errors and some clarifications and rewording to ensure consistency between protocol sections.

These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment. Airflow limitation occurs as a result of obstruction or narrowing of the airways when exposed to precipitating factors. Although exacerbations of asthma are episodic, inflammation is chronic ( GINA 2016 ). Despite existing therapies there is still significant unmet medical need in asthma, with an estimated 300 million people affected worldwide. The Global Burden of Asthma Report estimates that 15 million disability –adjusted life years (DALYs) are lost annually due to asthma, representing 1% of the total global burden. Annual worldwide deaths have been estimated at 250,000 ( Masoli 2004 ). Global Initiative forAsthma guideline s recommend use of low dose ICS (inhaled corticosteroid) controller treatment for step ≥ 2 while preferred controller treatment for step ≥ 3 is the combination of I CS/LABA (inhaled corticosteroid / long- acting beta 2-agonist )with a low dose ICS or mid/high dose ICS monotherapy (GINA 2016 ). Fixed dose combination (FDC) products containing a LABA plus ICS have been shown to be safe and effective in the management of asthma. However, most of currently available FDC products ( e.g., salmeterol xinafoate /fluticasone propionate) require twice a day(b.i.d.) dosing to achieve an optimum therapeutic effect in asthma. Novartis is developing QMF 149, an inhaled FDC of indacaterol acetate, a LABA with 24-hour duration of action and mometasone furoate (MF) an ICS, as a once daily (o.d.) maintenance treatment of asthma. QMF149 is formulated as a lactose -blended inhalation powder, hard capsule, delive red by a single dose dry powder inhaler (SDDPI), referred to as the Concept1 device (Breezhaler®).Concept1 isthe approved inhalation device for use with indacaterol maleate and other Novartis COPD inhalation therapies . Background data for Indacaterol and Mometasone furoate monotherapies: Indacaterol Indacaterol maleate, a long-acting beta 2-agonist , delivered via the Concept1 device in a single dose dry powder inhaler (SDDPI ) (Onbrez®Breezhaler®)is approved in over 110 countries worldwide for the once daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment of airflow obstruction in patients with COPD. In addition to the extensive evidence for indacaterol maleate delivered via the Concept1 device in COPD, there are clinical data to support the efficacy and safet y of indacaterol (as acetate salt) in asthma both as mono -component (as add-on to existing ICS) as well is in the fixed dose combination QMF149 (indacaterol acetate /MF) delivered by the Twisthaler® device in asthma patients.

Two studies ( CQMF149E2203 and CQAB149B2357) were conducted to support the selection of indac aterol 150 μg which is the proposed dose to be carried forward in the Phase III QVM program. Study CQMF149E2203 investigated two(2)doses of indacaterol acetate, 75μgand 150μgdelivered via Concept1 in adult patients with asthma and demonstrated superiority of treatment with indacaterol acetate 75μgand 150μg to placebo in terms of trough FEV 1after 12 weeks of treatment. Although the study was not powered to show a statistically significant difference between indacaterol acetate 150μg and 75μg for the efficacy objectives, it demonstrated positive trends in favor of indacaterol acetate 150μg in terms of trough FEV 1 PEF and rescue medication use compared with indacaterol acetate 75μg. Both indacaterol acetate doses 150 μg and 75 μg treatments were safe and well tolerated. A dose-ranging study CQAB149B2357 of indacaterol maleate in asthmatic patients demonstrated that a dose of 150 microgram o.d. was safe and effective. Furthermore , study CQAB149B2338, a 26-week study in asthmatic patients showed that indacaterol maleate at doses of 300 microgram and 600 microgram o.d. were also well -tolerated in this population. In the QVM149 program, the indacaterol acetate salt will be used. I ndacaterol maleate salt has been associated with post- inhalational cough, both as a monotherapy and part of a fixed -dose combination with MF(in the Twisthaler®), without any negative impact on safety, efficacy or tolerability in patients with COPD or asthma. The acetate salt of indacaterol was chosen following demonstration of a significantly lower incidence of post -inhalational (PI) cough with acetate and xinafoate salts compared with the maleate salt without any impact on safet y and comparable efficacy and sy stemic exposure (CQAB149D2301). Mometasone furoate Mometasone furoate (MF) is a corticosteroid and the active ingredient in the currentl y marketed product AsmanexTwisthaler®(mometasone furoate inhalation powder delivered via a multi - dose dry powder inhaler (MDDPI)) . AsmanexTwisthaler®is currently indicated for the once or twice -daily maintenance treatment of persistent asthma in adults and adolescents >12 years and, in the US, in children aged >4 years. AsmanexTwisthaler®is approved at doses of 100µg, 200µg and 400µg (per delivered dose) up to a maximum daily dose of 800µg for patients with severe disease, with preferred administration in the evenings. Merck is the Marketin g Authorization Holder in 60 countries worldwide. In adult and adolescent patients 12 years of age and older, MF (Asmanex®Twisthaler®) was studied in 10 placebo- controlled clinical trials of 8 to 12 weeks duration with a total of 1750 patients receiving Asmanex®Twisthaler®. There were also 3 trials with a total of 475 patients receiving Asmanex®Twisthaler®for 1 year. In the 8 to 12-week clinical trials, the population was 12 to 83 years of age. In three long-term safety trials (two 9 -month extensions o f efficacy trials and one 52-week active -controlled safet y trial), 475 patients with asthma received various doses of Asmanex®Twisthaler®for 1 year."

Based on existing data for the MF component in the Twisthaler®device, a 3-Step bridging approach was conducted to determine MF dose for Concept1 which is comparable to each of the registered daily doses of Asmanex®Twisthaler® (mometasone furoate, inhalation powder). Pharmacokinetic bridging utilizing pharmacokinetic characterization in study CQMF149E2101 ( Step 1) (Vaid ya et al, 2012) followed byin-vitro fine particle mass adjustment ( Step 2) and finally pharmacod ynamic evaluation of efficacy in asthma patients in study CQMF149E2201 ( Step 3). For Steps1 and 2, the data of study CQMF149E2101 (Vaidy a et al, 2012) ,along with in -vitro fine particle mass adjustments have determined that doses of 80, 160, and 320microgram of MF in Concept1 device are comparable in strength to the approved doses of 200 microgram , 400microgram and 800 microgram (2x 400microgram ) MF in Twisthaler®.

The 12 week treatment epoch will be followed by a 30 day Follow -up epoch . There is a screening visit (Visit 1) where informed consent is obtained and current asthma and other non- asthma medications are reviewed. Where appropriate, concurrent asthma and other medications are adjusted at this visit and prohibited asthma medications are replaced with permitted asthma medications for use throughout the stud y. All patients should have been on a stable dose of inhaled low dose corticosteroids (with or without LABA) for at least 1 month prior to Visit 1. Once the concurrent medications compl y with the requirements of the study (Section 5.5.7 and Section 5.5.8) patients will enter a Run- inepoch at Visit 101. At Run-inVisit 101 all patients will receive an open -label fluticasone propionate 100 µ gb.i.d. delivered via Accuhaler®(if not available in a specific country , open -label fluticasone propionate 125 µg b.i.d. via MDI inhaler orfluticasone propionate in an alternative formulation at an equivalent dose strength )for use throughout the Run-inepoch which will be stopped at Visit 102 (end of Run-inepoch) (Figure 3-1). The screening epoch between Visit 1 and Visit 101 is used to ensure washout of prior asthma medication. Depending on prior asthma medication and washout requirements, the period between Visit 1 and Visit 101 may be shorter than 2 weeks. At Visit 1 (Screening), all patients will be given salbutamol/albuterol to use as rescue medication throughout the study .They will be issued an electronic dia rycombined with Peak Flow (PEF) meter to record asthma symptoms and rescue medication use. After the end of the S creening epoch (m aximum 2 weeks after Visit 1), starting with the Run -inepoch (Visit 101), patients will record Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEF)twice daily. The Run-inepoch is three (3) weeks in duration and will be used to assess eligibility of the patients prior to enter ing the treatment epoch and to collect baseline values for some variables. Patient can enter the Run-inepoch provided inclusion criteria are met, including those for spirometry (pre-dose percent predicted FEV 1, ATS/ERS criteria ,and reversibility ) as per spirometry equipment. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria at Visit 102will be randomized to one of following two treatment groups with an equal (1:1) randomization ratio: QMF149 150/80 microgram o.d. delivered via Concept1 MF 200 microgram o.d. delivered via Twisthaler®"
22,page_22,"Novartis Confidential Page 23 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 0 2)Clean Version Protocol No. CQVM149B2303 Randomized patients must have FEV 1between 60% and < 90% of predicted normal atboth Visit 101and Visit 102 and they must qualify for treatment with low dose ICS plus LABA as perGINA 2016 guidelines. At Visit 102, allrandomized patients must have ACQ -7 ≥ 1.5. Refer toSection 4.1 Inclusion Criteria for ACQ -7 requirements. Visit 102(end of Run-in)and Visit 201(R andomization) must take place sequentially on the same day . The assessments at Visit 102 should be performed prior to administration of the first dose of study medication (Visit 201). Reversibility should NOT be done at Visit 102 ( Table 6 - 1). Ra ndomized patients will enter the 12 - week T reatment epoch .All patients will receive both Concept1 and Twisthaler®inhalers (double -blind and double -dummy design) . During the treatment epoch, patients willbe instructed toinhale study medication once daily in the evening (between 5:00 pmand 8:00 pm ). Patients will be followed at regular intervals throughout the 12 week treatment epoch to assess the safet y and efficacy of treatment, either by telephone or at clinic visits. Clinic visits are scheduled to take place after 4, and 12 weeks. All clinic visits should occur as scheduled per Table 6-1. Patients will be required to attend the clinic visits to perform trough measurements of lung function (24 hours post dosing) after the first dose of study medication (Visit 201) and after the dose of study me dication administered at the clinic after 12 weeks o f treatment (Clinic Visit 204). In case of logistical issues, Visit 204 (Week 12) should take place within a 4 day window. If this is not possible, the sponsor should be notified. Pre-dose FEV 1measureme nts will be assessed at Week 4. Telephone reviews of patients’ status will be conducted after 8 weeks of treatment. Telephone contact with patients may indicate that a clinic visit is necessary , in which case an unscheduled clinic visit should be arranged as soon as possible and should include safet y assessment (AEs, concomitant medications review and unscheduled laboratory exams as appropriate). A final telephone contact must be conducted at 30-days after last treatment date (telephone V isit 301 or unsched uled visit safety call for patients who discontinue treatment earlier than 12 weeks). The first dose of study medication will be administered at the clinic in the evening (between 05:00 pm and 08:00 pm) at Visit 201 (Day 1). Subsequent clinic visits will be scheduled so that patients will be reassessed as close as possible to the same time relative to the evening doses. Patients will be instructed not to take their evening dose of study medi cation on the day s of the clinic visits, as these doses will be administered at the clinic under the supervision of study personnel."

The analyses will be performed in a sample size of approximately 750 patients. The patient population will be described in more detail in the Section 4. 3.3 Rationale for dose/regimen, route of administration and duration of treatment This study is a pivotal, multi -center, randomized, double -blind, double -dummy , parallel- group, Phase III study with a 12-week treatment epoch which is required to assess the safety and efficacy of QMF149 in asthma. The primary endpoint will be evaluated over 12 weeks. The dose regimen/route of administration of QMF149 selected (150/80 microgram delivered via Concept1) is based on the findings of previous studies identify ing effective and safe doses of the individual components of the FDC, indacaterol and MF) ( Section 1.1). The 12 week duration is considered adequate to demonstrate improvements in the primary endpoint based on the known pharmacod ynamic properties of the components of each fixed - dose combination and precedent of other inhaled combination products in asthma. 3.4 Rationale for choice of comparator MF was selected as the comparator as it is the ICS monocomponent in QMF149 combination formulatio n and is necessary in order to demonstrate the additional benefit of a LABA (indacaterol acetate 150 microgram ) in the QMF 149combination ( Appendix 9)ascompared to MF monotherap y in patients whose asthma is inadequat ely controlled with ICS alone. Furthermore, MF in Twisthaler®formulation is approved for treatment in asthma. The MF inhalation powder formulation is marketed as a MDDPI called Asmanex®Twisthaler® for the treatment of asthma and is currently approved in the Unites States for the treatment of asthma in adults and children ≥4 years of age and is approved in over 55 countries world -wide for the treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents ≥ 12 years old. The MF 200 microgram o.d. delivered via Twisthaler®is comparable to MF 80 microgram o.d. delivered via Concept1 (Section 1.1). 3.5 Purpose and timing of interim analy ses/design adaptations No interim analy sis for efficacy is planned. It is planned that t he independent Data Monit oring Committee (DMC )will review semi - blinded ( i.e., treatment group s names asAandB) safet y data (Section 8.4). The details of the information flow, confidentiality and specific analy sis will be available from the DMC Charter . 3.6 Risks and benefits ICS/LABA fixed dose combinations are frequently used as controller medications and are foundation therap y in GINA step ≥ 3 ( GINA 2016 ). QMF149 (indacaterol 150 microgram as an FDC with three doses of MF: 80microgram , 160 microgram or 320 microgram ) is a new once daily ICS/LABA FDC in development for asthma for which a Phase II development was recently successfully completed."
25,page_25,"Novartis Confidential Page 26 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 0 2)Clean Version Protocol No. CQVM149B2303 There is evidence of efficacy and safet y of the mono components indacaterol and MF in asthma and COPD (indacaterol). In addition, supportive efficacy and safet y information was gained from the earl y QM F149 development in the Twisthaler®device ( see Section 1.1) a ndQMF149 Investigator Brochure .To further investigate the overall risk and benefit evaluation of QMF149 FDC delivered by Concept1, an MF 80 microgram dose in combination with indacaterol acetate (QMF149) is selected for further evaluation in Phase III. In one large Phase II event driven trial with a duration up to 68 weeks in over 1500 moderate to severe asthma patients including adolescents (12-17 years of age), indacaterol/mometasone 500/400 microgram delivered by Twisthaler®comparable to indacaterol 150/160 microgram delivered by Concept1 showed a favorable efficacy and safety profile over MF alone ( Beasley et al 2015 ). Further efficacy and safety trials in Phase II included different indacaterol doses on background of MF in Concept1 in moderate to severe asthma (QMF149E2203), a device bridging study with MF in Concept1 (QMF149E2201) and an efficacy and safet y study with QMF149 in Concept1 in moderate to very severe COPD patients (QMF149F2202). The studies showed statistically significant improvements in lung function and symptomatic endpoints including exacerbations and confirmed a favorable and robust efficacy and safet y profile in P hase II. In this Phase III study , randomized patients will receive either QMF149 or MF throughou t the treatment epoch (12 weeks). Throughout the trial, patients will be given access to rescue medication (i.e., short acting beta-2agonist (SABA) ), thus limiting the risk of significant asthmatic AEs. At no time during the study will any patient be without treatment for asthma. The risk to the patients in participating in this study is that QMF149 is under development and therefore unexpected safety issues may be possible in patients randomized to QMF149 treatment (Section 5.6.2 ). This risk will be minimized by adherence to the patient eligibility criteria as stated in the study protocol and by close clinical monitoring of all patients. The risks of side effects from the study medication are those known for the individual compounds indacaterol and MF, and no additional risks have been identified that might occur when the two components are administered concurrentl y or from the same inhaler. Further information can be obtained from the most current QMF 149 Investigator’s Brochure . There is evidence that LABA treatment used alone in asthma might cause asthma exacerbations (FDA warning, Advair®Diskus®prescription information ).This risk is mitigated by the fact that all p atients will have a minimum background therapy of low dose ICS (monotherapy or in combination with L ABA , depending on treatment arm ). The potential benefit for the patient includes an improvement in the pulmonar y function testing and a potential translati on into better asthma control, such as reductions in symptoms and rescue medication use, and improved qualit y of life. A thorough medical evaluation of the patient’s disease and close clinical monitoring for the duration of the study may be considered as additional benefit to the patient. Frequent and regular contacts between the patient and site staff will occur in terms of clinic visits and telephone contacts to each patient throughout the 12-week treatment epoch. In addition, safet y monitoring ( e.g., symptom collection and rescue medication use via electronic diary ), assessment of compliance with the study medication regimen, and PEF (twice daily)"
26,page_26,"Novartis Confidential Page 27 Clinical Trial Protocol (Version 0 2)Clean Version Protocol No. CQVM149B2303 measurements at regular intervals throughout the study will help assess status of the patient’s asthma sympto m control. eDiary data will be transmitted electronically from the device to the investigator daily . Therefore, investigators will be able to monitor the patients closel y throughout the stud y in case of an early indication of worsening s ymptoms. In the event of worsening asthma symptoms, guidance to manage potential worsening of asthma symptoms is available to the investigators in accordance with 6 guideline recommendations. Patients will be provided with clear written instructions on contact ingthe investigator in case of worsening of their symptoms. The investigator must discontinue study treatment or withdraw thepatient from the study if, he/she believes that continuation would be detrimental to the patient’s well- being. Patients are also instructed that they can withdraw from the study at any time, and for any reason. Patients will be followed up for safet y for 30 days after they have stopped study participation (defined as time of last dose of study drug taken or last visit whichever is later) In summary , based on the available data of QMF149 and the efficacy and safet y data of the marketed monotherapy components, it is anticipated that QMF149 150/80 microgram will have a favorable benefit to risk profile in this patient population with asthma. 4 Population The study population will consist of approximately 750males and females with a diagnosis of asthma ≥ 12 and ≤ 75 years of age. Approximately 50patients enrolled in the study will be adolescents (≥ 12and < 18). Adolescent patients with a diagn osis of asthma should be symptomatic on low dose I CS(ACQ - 7 ≥ 1.5). Patients more adequatel y controlled taking low dose ICS/LABA (ACQ -7 score ≥ 1 and < 1.5) may also be included , however they can only be enrolled to double -blind treatment if ACQ - 7 score is≥ 1.5 at the time of randomization. The ACQ -7 thresholds for level of control are consistent with published literature (Juniper 2006). Although Juniper does not specifically define ‘adequate control’, it can be reasonabl y estimated to be around 1, which is considered the crossover point between ‘well controlled’ and ‘not well controlled’ asthma (Juniper 2006 ); therefore a range of ≥ 1to < 1.5 is considered acceptable as an appropriate range for ‘adequatel y’ controlled asthma . Adult patients with a diagnosis of asthma should be symptomatic on low dose ICS or low dose ICS/LABA with ACQ -7 score ≥ 1.5. It is anticipated 1370 patients will need to be screened in order to randomize approximately 750 patients into the two treatment groups with a randomization ratio of 1:1 (i.e.,approximately 375 patients per treatment group). At least 676randomized patients (338 per treatment group) are needed to complete the study . Drop-outs after randomization will not be replaced. This study will enroll multi -nationally and patients will be stratified according to prognostic factors o f age ( ≥ 12to < 18 years or ≥18) and non-prognostic factor region to achieve improved homogeneity within each stratum."

Most often, study treatment discontinuation (TD) and knowledge of the possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a study patient who presents with an emergency condition. Emergency treatment code breaks areperformed using the IRT. When the investigator contacts the system to break a treatment code for a patient, he/she must provide the requested patient identify ing information and confirm the necessity to break the treatment code for the patient. The invest igator will then receive details of the investigational drug treatment for the specified patient and a fax or email confirming this information. The system will automatically inform the Novartis monitor for the site and the Novartis Clinical Trial Head that the code has been broken. It is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that there is a dependable procedure in place to allow access to the IRT/code break cards at any time in case of emergency . The investigator will provide: protocol number study drug name (if available) patient number In addition, oral and written information to the patient must be provided on how to contact his/her backup in cases of emergency , or when he/she is unavailable, to ensure that unblinding can be performed at an y time. Study drugs must be discontinued after emergency unblinding. Study drugs must also be discontinued for an y patient whose treatment code has been inadvertentl y broken. 5.6 Stud y completion and discontinuation 5.6.1 Study completion and post- study treatment Completi on of the study will be when the last patient has completed Visit 301 and as close as possible to safety follow -upat Da y 114 for serious adverse events (SAEs). The investigator must provide follow - up medical care for all patients who are prematurely withdrawn from the study, or must refer them for appropriate ongoing care. 5.6.2 Discontinuation of study treatment Patients may voluntaril y discontinue study drug(discontinue double -blind study medication but continue with study participation) at any time. Patie nts who wish to discontinue double -blind study medication will be asked to remain in the study and complete all study visits for"

Patients withdrawn from study drug will receive standard of care (SoC) asthma therap y according to investigator judgment. The investigator should discontinue study treatment for a given patient and/or withdraw the patient from the stud y if, on balance, he/she believes that continuation would be detrimental to the patient’s w ell-being. Study treatment must be discontinued under the following circumstances: Patients who experience one“severe” asthma exacerbations ( as defined inSection 6.4.9) during the 12 week treatment epoch that requir estreatment with sy stemic corticosteroids or hospitalization (including intubation). Patients with > 50% decrease in FEV 1from Baseline (e.g.,Visit 101) confirmed by a repeat measurement the same day during the Run-inor during the treatment epoch (Baseline being then Visit 201) . If a patient develops a medical condition that requires consistent use of prohibited treatment as per Section 5. 5.8or if patient is not compliant because of use of prohibited medications. Any other protocol deviation that results in a significant risk to the patient’s safet y. If a patient experiences paradoxical bronchospasm, as recommended in the QMF149 Investigator Brochure Any other protocol deviation that results in a significant risk to the patient’s safet y. Discontinuation of study treatment (but continued study participation) For this study it is very important to continue collecting data, especiall y vital status, on all patients whether or not he/she c ompletes treatment to continue collecting safet y information. The patient should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study due to study treatment interruption or discontinuation. If premature discontinuation of stud y treatment occurs, the patient should return to the clinic as soon as possible for a study Treatment Discontinuation (TD)visit. The investigator must determine the primary reason for the patient’s premature discontinuation of study treatment and record this information on the End ofStudy Treatment eCRF . The investigator and study staff must discuss with the patient the continued participation in the study by maintaining regular telephone contact with him/her or with a person pre -designated. This telephone contact should preferably be done acc ording to the study visit schedule. The data which must continue to be collected for all patients (including the patients discontinuing study treatment) are adverse event andserious adverse events for up to 30 days after drug discontinuation and survival status until the end of the study follow -up visit (Visit 301). Any patient whose treatment code has been broken inadvertently or for any non-emergency reason should be discontinued from the double blind study medication. Patients can voluntaril y stay in the study and complete all study visits for assessment of safet y and vital status. The survival status also needs to be collected until the end of the study Follow -up visit (Visit 301) Patients who discontinue study treatment should NOT be considered withdrawn from the study .

The patient disposition status should be entered on the eCRF .The investigator should document an explanation of why the patient is withdrawing from the study . Following these assessments all study participation for that patient will cease and data to be collected at subsequent visits will be considered missing. The investigator must also notify the IRT (Interactive Voice Response System( IVRS )/ Interactive Web Response System( IWRS)) of the premature discontinuation of study treatment. Patients who prematurel y discontinue study treatment and withdraw from the study will not be replaced. 5.6.4 Lostto follow up For subjects whose status is unclear because they fail to appear for study visits without stating an intention to discontinue or withdraw the investigator should allow “due diligence ” by documenting in the source documents steps taken to contact the subjec t, e.g., dates of telephone calls, registered letters, etc. A patient cannot be considered as lost to follow up until the time point of his/her scheduled end of study visit has passed. 5.6.5 Early study termination by the sponsor The study can be terminated by Novartis at any time for any reason .This may include reasons related to the benefit risk assessment of participating in the study based on the Data Monitoring Committee advic e, practical reasons (including slow enrol lment) , or for regulatory or medical reasons. Should this be necessary , the patient should be seen as soon as possible and treated as a prematurel y discontinued patient. The investigator may be informed of additional procedures to be followed in order to ensure that adequate consideration is given to the protection of the patient’s interests. The investigator will be responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRBs/IECs) of the early termination of the trial, unless otherwise required b y local country regulations. Inaddition, a Data Monitoring Committee will be used, which will evaluate safet y data on a regular basis and can recommend adjustment to study conduct (including stoppage) at any time. Please see Section 8.4 for more details 6 Visit schedule and assessments The study will consist of a Screening epoch, a Run-inepoch, a 12-week blinded treatment epoch and a Follow -up epoch of 30 day s after the last treatment."

Patients should be seen for all visits on the design ated daysor as close as possible to those dates.While Visit 102 (end of Run-in) and Visit 201( Randomization ) must take place on the same day,a visit window of 4 days is allowed at Visit 204as described in Section 3.1 (if this is not possible, the sponsor should be notified) . All data obtained for these assessments must be supported in the patients’ source documentation. At Visit 1, all patients will be issued an electronic diary to record asthma s ymptoms and rescue medication use and at Visit 101, a Peak Flow meter to record Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEF) twice daily. The Run-inepoch will be used to assess eligibility of the patients to enter the treatment epoch and to collect baseline values for some variables. Once patient’s eligibility is confirmed (at Visit 102), patient will be randomized to one of the two treatment groups with an equal (1:1) randomization ratio : QMF149 150/80 microgram o.d delivered via Concept1 MF 200 microgram o.d.delivered via Twisthaler® Visits 102 and 201 should take place sequentiall y on the same day andVisit 102 assessments should be performed prior to administration of the first dose of study medication (Visit 201). The scheduled assessments should be performed in the following order : Patient reported outcomes ( PROs) (i .e., ACQ, AQLQ ), ECG, radial pulse rate, blood pressure and blood /urine samples followed b y spirometry (as per Table 6 -2). The details of spirometry assessments are indicated inTable 6-2. An approximate 3 min rest from start of ECG to the start of spirometry manoeuvres should be given .When anECG is needed to be taken after spirometry ,a 10 minuterest from the end of spirometry tostart of ECG assessments should be considered.

The ACQ - 7 (Juniper et al 1999; Juniper et al 2005, and Juniper et al 2006) is a seven - item disease -specific instrument developed and validated to assess asthma control in patients in clinical trials as well as in individuals in clinical practice. ACQ - 7 will be provided to the site. All seven items are then scored on a 7-point Likert scale, with 0 indicating total control and 6 indicating no control. The questions are equall y weighted and the total score is the mean of the seven items. The proportion of patients who achieve an improvement of at least 0.5 in ACQ - 7 (i.e.,decrease of ACQ -7score of at least 0.5 from Baseline ) at post- baseline visits will also be analyzed. The first 6 questions of the ACQ -7 areto be completed by the patient while the last question (question 7) is to becompleted by the study investigator using spirometry data generated bythe spirometry equipment .The ACQ -7 should be completed at the study site at Visits 101, 102, 202, 204 and TD Visit if applicable. 6.4.3 Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (A QLQ -S +12) The AQLQ -S +12 is a 32-item disease specific questionnair e designed to measure functional impairments that are most important to patients with asthma (Appendix 6).It consists of 4 domains :symptoms, emotions, exposure to environmental stimuli and activity limitation. Patients are asked to recall their experiences during the previous 2 weeks and to score each item on a 7 -point scale. The overall AQLQ score is the mean response to all 32 questions (Juniper et al 1992, andJuniper et al1993). Clinically important differences in scores between any two assessments have been determined by the authors of the AQLQ. Changes in scores of 0.5 are considered clinicall y meaningful; changes of 1.0 are considered as mo derate and > 1.5 as large changes for an y individual domain or for the overall summary score ( Juniper et al 1994). AQLQ sho uld be completed at Visits 102 and 204."

The patients will be instructed to routinely complete the eDiary twice daily –at the same time each morning and again approximately 12 hours later in the evening. The eDiary is to be reviewed by study site personnel at each clinic visit until study completion . Sites and patient s will receive appropriate training and guidance on the use of the eDiary device. A list of the asthma control eDiary questions is provided in Appendix 7. 6.4.5 Peak Expiratory Flow (PEF) An electronic Peak Flow Meter part of the eDiary device will be provided to each patient at Visit 101for the measurement of morning and evening PEF during the Run-inand treatment period s. PEF will be measured at consistent times for a patient, in the morning and evening each day during the study from Visit 101 to 204 and TD Visit (if applicable) . The measurements will be performed using an e-Peak Flow Meter provided to the patients at Visit 101. PEF will be measured twice a day; once in themorning and once approximately 12 hours later in the evening (prior to evening dose) from Run -inthroughout the study . Patients should be encouraged to perform morning and evening PEF measurements BEFORE taking rescue medication. At each time point , the patient should be instructed to perform 3 consec utive maneuvers within 10 minutes. These PEF values are captured in the e -PEF/diary . The best of 3 values will be used. 6.4.6 Rescue Medication Usage The use of rescue salbutamol/albuterol should be recorded by patients in their eDiary twice each day in the morn ing and evening. In the morning patients should record the number of puffs of rescue medication they have taken during the night and since the last diary entry, and in the evening patients should record the number of puffs of rescue medication they have taken durin g the day since the morning diary entry . 6.4.7 Investigational Medication Usage In order to ensure compliance and safet y follow -up, the patients will be requested to record once per week in the eDiary whether he/she missed any dose and from which inhala tion device . 6.4.8 Worsening of asthma Investigators and patients will be instructed how to deal with worsening of asthma sy mptoms. The data captured in the eDiary will also be used to alert the patient and/or investigator to possible signs of worsening asthma a nd to possible asthma exacerbation. The investigator must provide the patient with written instructions to contact the investigator if at any time during the trial from the Run-inonwards if one or more of the following criteria of worsening asthma develop:"

The Baseline FEV 1for the treatment epoch is taken at treatment Day 1 (Visit 201). The Baseline PEF (morning and evening) for the treatment epoch is calculated at Visit 102 and is the mean of the best of the three daily PEF measurements over the Run- inperiod. If any of the above criteria ,including the alert from eDiary are metwhile a patient is in the Run- inor treatment epoch, the investigator should assess the patient ’scondition. If this occurs during the Run-inepoch, and it is considered a clinically significant asthma worsening in the investigator’s opinion, the patient should be treated for asthma worsening as appropriate and discontinued prior to randomization. Once the condition is resolved, if eligibility criteria are met, the patient may be considered for re-screen ing. The alerts which are trigged by above criteria are in place to detect early onset of asthma worsening at any time during the study to help direct early intervention. Therefore the investigat or should do the following when alerts are received: Review alert trends over time, in particular PEF decreases . Call the patient promptly to assess the clinical status when an y specific alert ty pe (e.g., PEF <60%) is received on consecutive day s. This may include urgent clinic visits as appropriate and/or immediate treatment . Implement prompt clinical treatment as deemed necessary by the investigator . If patient believe s thathis/her symptoms are worsening and/or has receive dalerts as outlined above the patient should notify the investigator in order to beevaluated and treated as clinically appropriate. Patient should be instructed to visit emergency room / hospital if deemed necessary . Patients should also be withdrawn for safet y reasons if, in the opinion of the investigators, it is appropriate to do so. Worsening of asthma s ymptoms may require unscheduled evaluation between visits. Study site personnel must be available to monitor and document patient’s progress until asthma control is regained. 6.4.9 Asthma Exacerbation A severe asthma exacerbation (Draft note for guidance on clinical investigation of medicinal products for treatment of asthma :CHMP/EWP/2922/01 Rev.1 ) is defined as an aggravation of"
56,page_56,"Novartis Confidential Page 57 Clinical Trial Pr otocol (Version 02) Clean Version Protocol No. CQVM149B2303 asthma symptoms (like shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, or chest tightness) that requires systemic corticosteroids (SCS) for at least three consecutive day s and/or a need for an ER visit orhospitalization due to asthma or death due to asthma. Start date and end date: In case of the use of SCSs for at least three day s, the first day of treatment will determine the onset date of the event while the last day of treatment will define the stop date. In the event that an ER visit and/or hospitalization due to asthma exacerbation were not associated with a course of SCSs as described above, start and end dates would be defined b y the corresponding dates entered b y the Investigator in the eCRF. A moderat e asthma exacerbation in this protocol is defined as the occurrence of two or more of the following: 1.Progressive increase of at least one of the asthma sy mptoms like shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, or chest tightness. The s ymptoms should be outside the patient’s usual range of day -to-day asthma and should last at least two consecutive day s. 2.Increased use of “rescue” inhaled bronchodilators defined b y: > 50% increase in SABA use and > 8 puffs on 2 out of any 3 consecutive day s compared to Baseline captured. Or Nighttime awakenings requiring SABA use on at least 2 out of an y 3 consecutive nights . 3. Deterioration in lung function, which last for two day s or more but usually not severe enough to warrant SCSs for more than 2 day s or hospitalization. This deterioration would be defined b y: > 20% decrease in FEV 1from baseline value . Or ≥ 20% decrease in am or pm PEF from baseline on 2 out of an y 3 consecutive days compared to baseline. Or <60% of PEF compared to baseline . A mild asthma exacerbation is defined as the occurrence of one of the following criteria: 1. Deterioration of at least one asthma symptoms like shortness of breath, cough, wheezing , or chest tightness. 2. Increased use of “rescue” inhaled bronchodilators . 3. Deterioration in lung function, which last for two days or more but usually not severe enough to warrant SCS or hospitalization. This deterioration would be defined b y: > 20% decrease in FEV 1from baseline value . Or"

Or <60% of PEF compared to B aseline . “Start and end dates” of each reported event in the eCRF will be used to determine whether two consecutivel y reported events should be considered as separate events or as a prolonged. If a second exacerbation is reported less than 7 days after the end date of a previous episode, then this will be assumed to be one continuous exacerbation with the start date taken from the first episode and the end date from the second or last episode. If two events are merged based on this “7 day rule”, the highest reported severit y will be used to describe the overall severity of the prolonged event. The treatment of asthma exacerbations including the initiation of systemic corticosteroids should be done according to investigator’s or treating physician’s medical judgement and should be in line with national and international recommendations. 6.4.10 Appropriateness of efficacy assessments The efficacy assessments selected are standard for this indication/patient population. 6.5 Safet y The following safet y assessments will be performed: Medical history and phy sical examination including orophary ngeal examination Vital signs Hematology , blood chem istry, urinalysis Evening plasma cortisol ECG AEs including asthma exacerbations and serious AEs Pregnancy (female patients) Serious asthma outcomes (asthma -related hospitalizations, intubations or deaths) ECG and l aboratory assessments will be centralized. Additional pregnancy testing might be performed if requested by local requirements. 6.5.1 Physical examination A physical examination will include the examination of general appearance, skin, neck (including thyroid), eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, back, lymph nodes, and extremities, va scular and neurological. If indicated ,based on medical history and/or symptoms, rectal, external genitalia, breast , and pelvic exams will be performed at Visits 101, 204 or TD visit (if applicable). An orophary ngeal examination will be performed at each clinic visit. Information for all phy sical examinations must be included in the source documentation at the study site.

(at Visits 101, 102, 201, 202, 204 or TDVisit, ifapplicable ). Vital sign should be measured directly after the ECG assessments. 6.5.3 Height and weight Height in centimeters (cm) will be measured at Visit 101 for all patients . In adolescents the height will additionally be measured at Visit 204 ( or TD Visit if applicable ). Body weigh t (to the nearest 0.1 kilogram in indoor clothing, but without shoes) will be measured at Visit 101, 204 ( or TDVisit if appli cable ) . BMI will be calculated based on height and weight. 6.5.4 Laboratory evaluations A central laboratory will be used for analy sis of all specimens collected. Details on the collections, shipment of samples and reporting of results by the central laboratory are provided to investigators in the laboratory manual. All patients with laboratory tests containing clinically significant abnormalities should be followed regularl y until the values return to within the normal ranges or until a valid reason other than drug- related adverse experiences is identified, even after the medication has discontinued. Safety laboratory assessments (hematology , clinical chemistry ,urinaly sis ) will be performed at Visit 101, 201, 204 and T D Visit if applicable . 6.5.4.1 Hematology Hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, white blood cell count with differential, and platelet count will be measured. 6.5.4.2 Clinical chemistry Albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase (AST )or Serum Glutamic - Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase (SGPT), bilirubin, creatinine, gamma -glutam yl transferase (γ-GT), glucose, potassium, magnesium, blood urea nitrogen ( BUN )and uric acid will be measured . If the total bilirubin concentration is increased above 1.5 times the upper limit of normal range, total bilirubin should be differentiated into the direct and indirect reacting bilirubin. 6.5.4.3 Urinaly sis Dipstick measurements for specific gravit y, pH, protein , glucose and blood will be performed at Visits 101, 201, and 204, or TD(if applicable) ."

The sampling point is as shown in Table 6-1 and Table 6 -2. 6.5.5 Electrocardiogram (ECG) ECGs should be recorded after 10 minutes rest in the supine position to ensure a stable Baseline . When the ECG recording time coincides with vital signs, spirometry , and blood draws, the ECG must be performed first, followed by vital signs and the blood draws but with enough time planned to ensure the spirometry is performed at the planned time point outlined in Table 6-2. Spirometry must be performed as close to the scheduled time point as possible. Centralized ECG equipment At Visit 101, a Screening ECG will be measured to test for eligibility for trial inclusion. (Patients whose ECG is abnormal at Screening due to technical/mechanical faults may be re- screened.) At Visits 201, and 204, ECGs will be measured at -35min pre-dose (evening dose) and post dose 1 hour, as indicated in Table 6-2. All ECG s should include 12 standard leads. An ECG tracing will be taken for those patients who prematurel y discontinue from the study treatment. For each ECG performed original trace should be printed. Each ECG will be sent electronicall y for central review directly from the ECG machine. One print- out will be generated and kept at the investigator site as source documentation and will be dated and signed. The patient 's number, the date, actual time of the tracing, and Stud y Code must appear on each page of the tracing. Full details of all procedures relating to the ECG collection and reporting will be contained in an investigator manual to be provided by the central laboratory to each investigator site. In the event that the central cardiologist reports that an ECG is abnormal, the investigator must assess whether the ECG abnormality is clinicall y significant or not. A clinically significant abnormality should be reported as an AE. If necessary a cardiologist may be consulted. Clinically significant ECG findings at Baseline must be discussed with the sponsor before administration with study drug . If a patient experiences a clinically significant change in cardiac rhythm or other clinically significant cardiovascular abnormalit y, the investigator should consider withdrawing the patient from the st udy."

Therefore , an AE may or may not be temporally or causall y associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product. The occurrence of AEs should be sought by non-directive questioning of the patient at each visit during the study . AEs also may be detected when they are volunteered by the patient during or between visits or through ph ysical examination, laboratory test, or other assessments. Abnorma l laboratory values or test results constitute AEs only if they fulfill at least one of the following criteria: induce clinical signs or sy mptoms, considered clinically significant, require therap y. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory values or test results should be identified through a review of values outside of normal ranges/clinically notable ranges, significant changes from Baseline or the previous visit, or values which are considered to be non -typical in patient with underly ing disease. Investigators have the responsibility for managing the safet y of individual patient and identify ing AEs. AEs must be recorded in the AEeCRF under the signs, s ymptoms or diagnosis associated with them, accompanied b y the following information. The severit y grade: Mild: usually transient in nature and generally not interfering with normal activities Moderate: sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities Severe: prevents normal activities Its relationship to the study treatment (Yes or No): “No Relationship to study treatment or other investigational treatment ” or “Relationship to study treatment” or “Relationship to other investigational treatment” or “Relationship to both study treatment and other investigational treatment or indistinguisha ble”. Its duration (start and end dates) or if the event is ongoing an outcome of not recovered/not resolved should be reported."

All AEs should be treated appropriately . Treatment may include one or more of the following: no action taken ( e.g., further observation only ) [investigational] treatment dosage increased/reduced [investigational] treatment interrupted/withdrawn concomitant medication or non -drug therap y given patient hospitalized/patient’s hospitalization prolonged (see Section 7.2 for definition of SAE) its outcome (not recovered/not resolved; recovered/resolved; recovering/resolving, recovered/resolved with sequelae; fatal; or unknown) Once an AEis detected, it should be followed until its resolution or until it is judged to be permanent, and assessme nt should be made at each visit (or more frequently , if necessary ) of any changes in severity, the suspected relationship to the study drug, the interventions required to treat it, and the outcome. Information about common side effects alread y known about the investigational drug can be found in the Investigator Brochure (IB). This information will be included in the patient informed consent and should be discussed with the patient during the study as needed. Any new information regarding the safet y profile of the medicinal product that is identified between IB updates will be communicated as appropriate, for example, via an Investigator Notification or an Aggregate Safet y Finding. New information might require an update to the informed consent and has then to be discussed with the patient . Investigators should be familiar with known potential adverse events outlined in the IB as well as local labelling. If patients experience such AEs (or an y AE), they should be treated as considered clinicall y appropriate. This may include discontinuation from treatment medication. The investigator should also instruct each patient to report any new adverse event (bey ond the protocol observation period) that the patient, or the patient’s personal physician, believes might reasonabl y be related to study treatment. This information should be recorded in the investigator’s source documents; however, if the AE meets the criteria of an SAE, it must be reported to Novartis. 7.2 Serious adverse events 7.2.1 Definition of SA E An SAE is defined as any AE(appearance of (or worsening of any pre-existing) undesirable sign(s), s ymptom(s) or medical conditions(s)) which meets any one of the following criteria: is fatal or life -threatening results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity constitutes a congenital anomaly /birth defect"
63,page_63,"Novartis Confidential Page 64 Clinical Trial Pr otocol (Version 02) Clean Version Protocol No. CQVM149B2303 requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, unless hospitalization is for: routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated wit h any deterioration in condition (specify what this includes) elective or pre -planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that is unrelated to the indication under study and has not worsened since signing the informed consent treatment on an emergency outpatient basis for an event not fulfilling any of the definitions of a SAE given above and not resulting in hospital admission social reasons and respite care in the absence of any deterioration in the patient’s general condition is medically significant , i.e., defined as an event that jeopardizes the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention. All malignant neoplasms will be assessed as serious under “medically significant” if other seriousness criteria are not met. Life-threatening in the c ontext of a SAE refers to a reaction in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the reaction; it does not refer to a reaction that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe ( Annex IV, ICH -E2D Guide line 2003). Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other situations should be considered serious reactions, such as important medical events that might not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalizati on but might jeopardize the patient or might require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed above. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or development of dependency or abuse ( Annex I V, ICH -E2D Guideline 2003). Any suspected transmission via a medicinal product of an infectious agent is also considered a serious adverse reaction. All AEs (serious and non-serious) are captured on the eCRF . SAEs are also required for individual reporting to Drug Safet y & Epidemiology DS&E )as per Section 7.2.2 . 7.2.2 SAE reporting To ensure patient safet y, every SAE, regardless of causalit y, occurring after the patient has provided informed consent and until 30 days after the patient has stopped study participation (defined as time of last dose of study drug taken or last visit whichever islater) must be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of the investigator learning of its occurrence / receiving follow up information . Any SAEs experienced after the 30 day period after the last study visitshould only be reported to Novartis if the investiga tor suspects a causal relationship to study treatment. Recurrent episodes, complications, or progression of the initial SAE must be reported as follow - up to the original episode, regardless of when the event occurs. This report must be submitted within 24hours of the investigator receiving the follow -up information. An SAE that is considered completel y unrelated to a previously reported one should be reported separately as a new event."
64,page_64,"Novartis Confidential Page 65 Clinical Trial Pr otocol (Version 02) Clean Version Protocol No. CQVM149B2303 Information about all SAEs is collected and recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form; all applicable sections of the form must be completed in order to provide a clinically thorough report. The investigator must assess the relationship of each SAE to each specific component of study treatment, (if study treatment consists of several components) complete the SAE Report Form in English, and submit the completed form within 24 hours to Novartis . Detailed instructions regarding the submission process and requirements for signature are to be found in the investigator fold er provided to each site. Follow -up information is submitted as instructed in the investigator folder. Each re-occurrence, complication, or progression of the original event must be reported as a follow -up to that event regardless of when it occurs. The f ollow -up information should describe whether the event has resolved or continues, if and how it was treated, whether the blind was broken or not, and whether the patient continued or withdrew from study participation. If the SAE is not previously documente d in the Investigator’s Brochure or Package Insert (new occurrence) and is thought to be related to the study druga Drug Safet y and Epidemiology Department associate may urgentl y require further information from the investigator for Health Authority reporting. Novartis may need to issue an Investigator Notification (IN) to inform all investigators involved in any study with the same study drugthat this SAE has been reported. Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and reported to the competent authorities and relevant ethics committees in accordance with European Union (EU)Guidance 2011/C 172/01 or as per national regulatory requirements in participating countries. 7.2.3 Pneumonia reporting Pneumonia will be defined as an event characterized by increased respiratory symptoms (e.g. increased cough, dyspnea, wheezing, purulent sputum), fever (i.e.,body temperature greater than 38°C) or pleuritic chest pain or leukocy tosis or other clinical signs consistent with pneumonia consider ed relevant in the opinion of the investigator and confirmed b y X-ray. Any reported pneumonia will have to be confirmed a by radiologist's interpretation of a chest X -ray (to be kept in the source documents). If not confirmed by X-ray, it should be reporte d as lower respiratory tract infection. 7.3 Liver safety monitoring To ensure patient safet y and enhance reliability in determining the hepatotoxic potential of an investigational drug, a standardized process for identification, monitoring and evaluation of liver events has to be followed. The following two categories of abnormalities/ AEs have to be considered during the course of the study (irrespective of whether classified/reported as (S)AE) : Liver laboratory triggers, which will require repeated assessme nts of the abnormal laboratory parameter Liver events, which will require close observation, follow -up monitoring and completion of the standard base liver eCRF pages"

Every liver laboratory trigger or liver event as defined in Table 8-1inAppendix 8should be followed up by the investigator or designated personal at the trial site as summarized below. Detailed information is outlined in Table 8-2in Appendix 8. For the liver laboratory trigger: Repeating the liver function test ( LFT)within the next week to confirm elevation. These LFT repeats should be performed using the central laboratory if possible. If this is not possible, then the repeats can be performed at a local laboratory to monitor the safet y of the patient. Repeats laboratory should then be performed at central laboratory as soon as possible. If a liver event is subsequently reported, any local LFTs previousl y conducted that are associated with this event should be reported on the L iver eCRF pages. If the elevation is confirmed, close observation of the patient will be initiated, including consideration of treatment interruption if deemed appropriate. For the liver events: Repeating the LFT to confirm elevation as appropriate Discontinuation of the investigational drug if appropriate Hospitalization of the patient if appropriate A causalit y assessment of the liver event via exclusion of alternative causes (e.g., disease, co-medications) An investigation of the liver event which needs to be followed until resolution. These investigations can include serology tests, imaging and pathology assessments, hepatologist’s consultancy , based on investigator’s discr etion. All follow -up information, and the procedures performed should be recorded on appropriate e CRF pages, including the liver event overview eCRF pages. 7.4 Pregnancy reporting To ensure patient safety , each pregnancy occurring after signing of the informe d consent must be reported to Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up to 3 months following the birth of your child to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of the birth, and the presence or absence of any birth defects, congenital abnormalities, or maternal and/or newborn complications. Pregnancy follow up period can be increased if requested b y health authorities. Pregnancy should be recorded on the Pharmacovigilance Pregnancy Form and reported by the investigator to the local Novartis Drug Safet y and Epidemiology Department. Pregnancy follow -up should be recorded on the same form and should include an assessment of the possible relationship to the investigational/stu dy treatment . Any SAE experienced during the pregnancy and unrelated to the pregnancy must be reported on a SAE form."

During the study , Novartis employ s several methods of ensuring protoco l and Good Clinical Practice (GCP )compliance and the quality /integrity of the sites’ data. The field monitor will visit the site to check the completeness of patient records, the accuracy of entries on the eCRFs, the adherence to the protocol and to Good Clinical Practice, the progress of enrollment, and to ensure that study treatment is being stored, dispensed, and accounted for according to specifications. Key study personnel must be available to assist the field monitor during these visits. Continuous remote monitoring of each site’s data may be performed by a centralized Novartis Clinical Research Associate (CRA )organization . Additionally , a central analytics organization may anal yze data andidentify risks andtrends for site operational parameters, and provide reports to Novartis Clinical Teams to assist with trial oversight. The investigator must maintain source documents for each patient in the study , consisting of case and visit notes (hospital or clinic medical records) containing demographic andmedical information, laboratory data, ECG s, and the results of any other tests or assessments. All information on eCRFs must be traceable to these source documents in the patient's file. The investigator must also keep the original informed consent form signed by the patient (a signed copy is given to the patient). The investigator must give the monitor access to all relevant source documents to confirm their consistency with the eCRF entries. Novartis monitoring standards require full verification for thepresence of informed consent, adherence to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documentation of SAEs, and of data that will be used for all primary variables. Additional checks of the consistency of the source data with the eCRFs are performed according to the study -specific monitoring plan. No information in source documents about the identity of the patients will be disclosed. 8.2 Data collection Designated investigator staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the (OC/RDC ) system. Designated investigator site staff will not be given access to the s ystem until they have been trained. Automatic validation procedures within the system check for data discrepancies during and after data entry and, by generating appropriate error messages, allow the data to be confirmed or corrected online by the designated investigator site staff. The Investigator must certify that the data entered into the eCRF s are complete and accurate. After database lock, the investigator will receive copies of the patient data for archiving at the investigational site. 8.3 Database management and quality control Novartis staff (or a designated Contract Research Organization ( CRO ))staff will review the data entered into the eCRFs by investigational staff for completeness and accuracy and instruct the site personnel to make any required corrections or additions. Queries are sent to the"
67,page_67,"Novartis Confidential Page 68 Clinical Trial Pr otocol (Version 02) Clean Version Protocol No. CQVM149B2303 investigational site using an electronic data query. Designated investigator site staff is requir ed to respond to the query and confirm or correct the data. Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug Reference List, which employ s the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification (ATC) system. Concomitant proced ures, non- drug therapies and AE s will be coded using the Medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) terminology . Laboratory samples will be processed centrall y and the results will be sent electronicall y to Novartis (or a designated CRO) . ECG re adings will be processed centrall y and the results will be sent electronically to Novartis (or a designated CRO). Spirometry readings will be processed centrally and the results will be sent electronicall y to Novartis Diary data will be entered into an electronic diary by the patient. The system will be supplied by a vendor(s), who will also manage the database. The database will be sent electronically to Novartis. Randomization codes and data about all study drug(s) dispensed to the patient and all dosage changes will be tracked using an Interactive Response Technology (IRT). The system will be supplied by a v endor, who will also manage the database. The database will be sent electronically to Novartis (or a designated CRO). Each occurrence of a code break via IRT will be reported to the clinical team and monitor. The code break functionality will remain available until study shut down or upon request of Novartis. The occurrence of relevant protocol deviations will be determined. After these actions have been completed and the database has been declared to be complete and accurate it will be locked and the treatment codes will be unbli nded and made available for data analy sis. Any changes to the database after that time can only be made after written agreemen t by Novartis Development management. 8.4 Data Monitoring Committee An independent, external data safety monitoring committee (DMC) will be set up to review all SAEs (including deaths and all hospitalizations) . DMC members will review this data generated externally and independently of Novartis, at predetermined intervals. If significant safet y issues arise in between scheduled meetings, ad-hoc meetings will be scheduled to review the data. Based on the safet y implications of the data, the DMC may need to recommend modification or termination of the study . The details of the information flow, confidentiality and specific anal yses required for the safet y monitoring anal ysiswill be documented in a DMC Charter. The DMC is the autonomous data and safet y advisory group for Novartis. The DMC charter will be developed asa separate document . The charter willdefine: 1. Membership of DMC 2.

Procedures for ensuring proper confidentiality, addressing conflict of interest, and ensuring proper communication The charter complies wit h Novartis SOPs and is in accordance with the FDA guidance and CHMP guidelines on DMCs. 8.5 Adjudication Committee An independent external adjudication committee will be established to assess serious asthma outcomes (asthma -related hospitalizations, intubati ons and deaths). All serious asthma outcomes, and deaths occurring from the time of randomization until the 30 days after the permanent discontinuation of study drug, where applicable, will be adjudicated. The committee will consist of experts outside Nova rtis who are not involved in the study conduct, who will periodically review blinded, pertinent patient data and the supporting documentation to settle the specified adjudication objectives. Further details will be provided in the Adjudication Committee Ch arter. 8.6 Advisory Board An Advisory Board will be established. This board will consist of a group of independent non - sponsor clinical experts and clinical/medical/statistical sponsor representatives. In general, the functions of the advisory board may include: Data interpretation Publications Presentations 9 Data analy sis The analysis will be conducted on all patient data at the time the trial ends. Measurements made after patients discontinue randomized treatment (off-treatment measures) will not be used for any efficacy evaluation. Any data analy sis carried out independently by the investigator should be submitted to Novartis before publication or presentation. 9.1 Analysis sets The following anal ysis sets are defined for data analy sis. The randomiz ation (RAN) Setwill consist of all patients who were assigned a randomization number, regardless of whether or not they actuall y received study medication."
69,page_69,"Novartis Confidential Page 70 Clinical Trial Pr otocol (Version 02) Clean Version Protocol No. CQVM149B2303 The Full Anal ysis Set (FAS) will consist of all patients in the RAN set who received at least one dose of stud y medication. Following the intent -to-treat principle, patients will be analy zed according to the treatment they were assigned to at randomization. The Per-Protocol Set (PPS) will include all patients in the FAS who did not have any major protocol deviatio ns. Major protocol deviations will be defined in the statistical analy sis plan prior to database lock and the unblinding of the study . Patients will be analy zed according to the treatment they received. The Safety Set will consist of all patients who received at least one dose of study medication. Patients will be analy zed according to the treatment they received. The FAS will be used in the analy sis of all efficacy variables. The RAN set will be used for a summary of patient disposition, demographics and baseline characteristics. The PPS will be used for supportive analysis of the primary analysis only. The Safet y Set will be used in the analysis of all safet y variables. Note that the FAS and Safety Sets are the same except that the Safety Set allows the inclusion of non-randomized patients who received study drug in error. Also, the FAS assign ed randomized treatment and the Safet y Set assigned received treatment. 9.2 Patient demographics and other baseline characteristics Demographic and baseline characteristics measured before random ization including age, gender , race, ethnicit y, height, weight, BMI, relevant medical history , Screening spirometry parameters: (FEV 1, FVC, FEV 1/FVC and FEF 25-75), FEV 1reversibility , percentage of predicted FEV 1, duration of asthma, history of asthma exacerbations, smoking history , prior concurrent medications (asthma -related and non-asthma related ), ,vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, radial pulse rate), QTc using Fridericia’s correction and baseline ACQ -7 and AQLQ willbe summarized by treatment group. Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) and categorical variables will be summarized in terms of the number and percentage of pati ents in each category . Baseline is defined as the last measurement before first dose of study drug. No statistical analyses will be provided for baseline comparability among the treatment groups. 9.3 Treatments Study drug administration and concomitant medica tion data will be listed and summarized using Safet y set. The duration of exposure and the number of patients randomized who completed the stud yand who discontinued from study medication will be summarized."

Concomitant therapies will be recorded, listed and summarized separatel y for asthma related medications/non- drug therapies and other medications. Concomitant asthma related medications will be summarized by the route of administration, the recorded pre -specified drug subcategories (including types of combination) and preferred terms. The summary will be repeated by showing ingredients instead of prefer red terms. Concomitant medications not related to asthma will be summarized by route of administration and preferred term . SABA usage (number of puffs) during the S creening epoch will be summarized. Patients taking prohibited concomitant medications will be noted in the summary of protocol deviations. Treatment compliance with study medication over the study period will be summarized. 9.4 Analysis of the primary variable 9.4.1 Primary variable The primary variable is trough FEV 1after 12 weeks of treatment. 9.4.2 Statistical model, hypothesis, and method of analy sis The comparis onof QMF149 150/80 microgram versus MF 200 microgram will be evaluated by testing the following null hy pothesis (H 0) versus the alternative h ypothesis (H a): H0: QMF149 treatment group is equal to MF treatment group in trough FEV 1at Week 12 Ha: QMF149 treatment group is not equal to MF treatment group in trough FEV 1at Week 12 The primary variable will be anal yzed using a mixed model for repeated measure (MMRM) on the FAS. The model will c ontain treatment, age ( ≥12 to < 18or ≥18 years), region, visit (Days 2 and 85), and treatment -by-visit interaction as fixed effects with baseline FEV 1measurement, baseline -by-visit interaction, FEV 1 prior to inhalation and FEV 1 within 15 to 30 min post inhalation of salbutamol/albuterol (components of SABA reversibility ) as covariates, and center nested within region as a random effect. The within -patient correlation will be modeled using an unstructured covariance matrix in the mixed model. The Kenward- Roger approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom (Kenward and Roger, 1997). I f the model does not converge with unstructured covariance matrix , the compound symmetr ycovariance matrix will be used in the mixed model. The restricted maximum likelihood method will be used. The between- treatment comparison will be carried out using the adjusted mean (least square smean (LS mean) ) difference based on the treatment main effect and the coefficient for the treatment -by- visit interaction for Day 85. The estimated adjusted treatment difference (QMF149 –MF) will be display ed along with the associated standard error, 2 -sided 95% confidence interval (CI),and p-value (2- sided) ."

If one of the two values is missing (or set to missing), then the remaining non-missing value will be taken as trough FEV 1. If both values are missing, or if the patient withdrew from the study (regardless of the reason for discontinuation) then trough FEV 1will be regarded as missing in which case the missing value(s) of the patient at the particular visit(s) would not directly contribute to the primary anal ysis. The MMRM which is used for the primary variable is based on missing at random mechanism for themissing values and assesses the treatment effects of trough FEV 1without explicit imputation. 9.4.4 Multiplicity adjustment A hierarchical testing procedure will be applied to control the ty pe-I error rate for the primary and the key secondary endpoints, i .e., the key secondary endpoint ACQ -7 will be tested only if the primary endpoint (trough FEV 1)is significant at the 2 -sided 0.05 level. 9.4.5 Supplementary analys is As supplementary analys is, the same MMRM used in the primary analysis will be also performed on the PPS to assess thetreatment effect in protocol adherers. The same primary MMRM on the FAS will be performed including all spirometr icmeasures irrespective of systemic corticosteroid or rescue med ication use but those measures taken outside of the 22-25 hour post -evening dose time will not be included. The following exploratory subgroup analyses for trough FEV 1using MMRM will be performed (using the appropriate interaction term in the model and additional covariate as a fixed effect if necessary ) for the FAS population to explore the treatment effect in: Age group ( ≥12 to < 18 years, ≥18 years) Race ( Caucasia n, Black, Asian, Other ) Gender (male, female) History of asthma exacerbation in the 12 months prior to S creening ( Yes, No) Patients’ prior therapies before Run-inperiod ( e.g., low dose I CS without LABA, low dose I CS with LABA) FEV 1response according to percent predicted FEV 1range at Baseline (60% to <70%, 70% to <90%, and < 60% or ≥ 90% in case of protocol deviations) ACQ -7 Baseline (1 to < 1.5, 1.5 to< 2, 2 to < 2.5, ≥ 2.5) 9.5 Key secondary variable The key secondary variable is ACQ -7 after 12 weeks of treatment."

All serious asthma outcomes and deaths occurring from the time of randomization until the 30 days after permanent discontinuation of study drug will be adjudicated by an independent external committee to determine their asthma relatedness. The composite endpoint as well as each single component of it will be analyzed for the number of patients with the event, the time to event and the annual rate of events. If a sufficient number of events will occur, similar anal yses as described for asthma exacerbations will be performed. Otherwise, a purel y descriptive analysis will be done only. 9.6.2.2 Adverse events All treatment emergent AEs including asthma exacerbations will be summarized and listed. AEs starting on or after the time of the first inhalation of study drug but not later than 7 days (30 days in the case of a SAE ) after the last inhalation will be classified as a treatment emergent AE.

The process of obtaining informed consent must be documented in the patient source documents. Patients below the legal age of consent are required to have the"
79,page_79,"Novartis Confidential Page 80 Clinical Trial Pr otocol (Version 02) Clean Version Protocol No. CQVM149B2303 Parental Informed Consent signed by the patient’s parent/guardian; adolescents are required to sign the Assent Form. In cases where the patient’s representative gives consent, the patient should be informed about the study to the extent possible given his/her understanding. If the patient is capable of doing so, he/she should indicate assent b y personally signing and dating the written informed consent document or a separate assent form. Novartis will provide to investigators in a separate document a proposed informed consent form that complies with the ICH GCP guideline and regulatory requirements and is considered appropriate for this study . Any changes to the proposed consent form sugges ted by the investigator must be agreed to by Novartis before submission to the IRB/IEC and a cop y of the approved version must be provided to the Novartis monitor after IRB/ IEC approval. Women of child bearing potential should be informed that taking the study treatment may involve unknown risks to the fetus if pregnancy were to occur during the study and agree that in order to participate in the study they must adhere to the contraception requirement for the duration of the study . If there is any question that the patient will not reliably compl y, they should not be entered in the study . 10.3 Responsibilities of the investigator and IRB/IEC Before initiating a trial, the investigator/institution must obtain approval/favorable opinion from the Institutional Revie w Board/Independent Ethics Committee (I RB/IEC) for the trial protocol, written informed consent form, consent form updates, patient recruitment procedures (e. g., advertisements) and any other written information to be provided to patients. Prior to study start, the investigator is required to sign a protocol signature page confirming his/her agreement to conduct the study in accordance with these documents and all of the instructions and procedures found in this protocol and to give access to all relevant d ata and records to Novartis monitors, auditors, Novartis Quality Assurance representatives, designated agents of Novartis, IRBs/IECs, and regulatory authorities as required. If an inspection of the clinical site is requested by a regulatory authority , the investigator must inform Novartis immediatel y that this request has been made. 10.4 Publication of study protocol and results The key design elements of this protocol will be posted in a publicly accessible database such as clinicaltrials.gov. In addition, upon study completion and finalization of the study report the results of this trial will be either submitted for publication and/or posted in a publicly accessible database of clinical trial results. 10.5 Qualit y control and qualit y assurance Novartis maintains a robust Quality Management (QM) system that includes all activities involved in quality assurance and qualit y control including the assignment of roles and responsibilities, the reporting of results, and the documentation of actions and escalation of issues identified during the review of qualit y metrics, incidents, audits and inspections. Audits of investigator sites, vendors and Novartis systems are performed by Novartis Pharma Auditing and Compliance Quality Assurance (CQA), a group independent from those involved"
80,page_80,"Novartis Confidential Page 81 Clinical Trial Pr otocol (Version 02) Clean Version Protocol No. CQVM149B2303 in conducting, monitoring or performi ng qualit y control of the clinical trial. The clinical audit process uses a knowledge/risk based approach Audits are conducted to assess GCP compliance with global and local regulatory requirements, protocols and internal SOPs, and are performed according to written Novartis processes. 11 Protocol adherence This protocol defines the study objectives, the study procedures and the data to be collected on study participants. Additional assessments required to ensure safety of patients should be administered as deemed necessary on a case by case basis. Under no circumstances ,including incidental collection isan investigator allowed to collect additional data or conduct any additional procedures for any purpose involving any investigational drugs under the protoco l, other than the purpose of the study .If despite this interdiction, data, information, observation would be incidentally collected, the investigator shall immediately disclose it to Novartis and notuse it for any purpose other than the study , except for the appropriate monitoring on study participants. Investigators ascertain they will apply due diligenc e to avoid protocol deviations. If an investigator feels a protocol deviation would improve the conduct of the study this must be considered a protocol amendment, and unless such an amendment is agreed upon by Novartis and approved by the IR B/IEC and healt h authorities, where required, it cannot be implemented. 11.1 Protocol amendments Any change or addition to the protocol can onl y be made in a written protocol amendment that must be approved by Novartis, health authorities where required, and the IRB/IEC prior to implementation. Only amendments that are intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to patients may be implemented immediately provided the health authorities are subsequentl y notified by protocol amendment and the reviewing IRB/ IEC is notifie d. Notwithstanding the need for approval of formal protocol amendments, the investigator is expected to take any immediate action required for the safety of an y pat ient included in this study, even if this action represents a deviation from the protocol. I n such cases, the reporting requirements identified in Section 7 Safety Monitoring must be followed."

Spirometers must have the capacity to print FVC tracings. All spirometry values should be reported at BTPS by the method established by the manufacturer. Calibration The spirometer should be calibrated every morning before any spirometric measurements for the study are performed. Calibration reports should be printed and stored as source data at the site. Preparing the test patient On study days when spirometry will be performed, patients should refrain from the following: Coffee, tea, ch ocolate, cola and other caffeine -containing beverages and foods and ice- cold beverages for 4 hours prior to spirometry Alcohol for 4 hours prior to spirometry Strenuous activity for 12 hours prior to spirometry Smoking within at least 1 hour of testing Exposure to environmental smoke, dust or areas with strong odors Every effort should be made to assure consistent testing conditions throughout the study . A seated position with nose clips is recommended to reduce risks related to dizziness or sy ncope. When possible, spirometry should be conducted by the same technician using the same spirometer. To minimize the effects of diurnal variation on lung function, spirometry visits should start at approximately the same time of day at each visit. Performing Sp irometry The patient ’s age, height and gender will be entered into the spirometer. It is important that the height is measured accurately at the study site. Spirometry , an effort -dependent test, requires careful instruction and cooperation of the patient .The technician should ensure a good seal around the mouthpiece, and confirm that the patient’s posture is correct. The patient should be instructed to perform a maximal inspiration, followed by maximum forced expiration until no more air can be exhaled orfor at least 6 seconds. Expiration must be rapid with exertion of maximal effort. The results of spirometry should meet the ATS/ERS criteria for acceptability and repeatability . Acceptability criteria should be applied before repeatability is determined. Number of trials A minimum of 3 acceptable forced vital capacity (FVC) maneuvers should be performed. If a patient is unable to perform a single acceptable maneuver after 8 attempts, testing may be discontinued. Acceptability An acceptable maneuver has the following characteristics:"
95,page_95,"Novartis Confidential Page 96 Clinical Trial Pr otocol (Version 02) Clean Version Protocol No. CQVM149B2303 No hesitation or false start; A rapid start; No cough, especially during the first second of the maneuver; No glottic closure or obstruction by tongue or dentures ; No earl y termination of exhalation (minimum exhalation tim e of 6 seconds is recommended, and no volume change for at least 1 second) or the patient cannot continue to exhale further . Overall acceptability will be determined by expert over -read b y spirometry vendor . Repeatability The 2 la rgest FEV 1values from 3 acceptable maneuvers should not vary b y more than 0.150 L. Recording of data The highest FEV 1and FVC from any of the acceptable curves are recorded. (The highest FEV 1 and FVC may not necessarily result from the same acceptable cur ve). Predicted normal This study will utilize the spirometric predication equation standards for the European Community for Coal and Steel2, Nhanes3, ERS Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI)2or Japanese Respiratory Society3. Reversibility All reversibility evaluations should follow the recommendations of the ATS/ERS Task force: Standardization of L ung Function Testing Administer 400 microgram of salbutamol/albuterol following the completion of the baseline assessment. A second spirometry assessment is then performed within 15 to 30minutes after administration of the salbumatol/albuterol.
