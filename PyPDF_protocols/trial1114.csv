Page 2 of 109 CONFIDENTIAL AMENDMENT HISTORY Amendment 3 The following table outlines the changes made to the protocol and the affected sections: Change Section Changed Due to an inadvertent operational error, 6 8 patients were potentially unblinded. In order to properly power for a sensitivity analysis for the subset of patients who were not potentially unblinded, additional patients will be enrolled and randomized . Included introduction of the modified full analysis set (mFAS), which exclude s potentially unblind ed patients , and will be used for sensitivity analysis . Stated that potentially unblinded patients will be excluded from the per protocol set (PPS). Added power calculation for the full analysis set (FAS) with the additional patients.

This was considered necessary to remain compliant with Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) regulations regarding enrolment practices until approval of this protocol amendment. Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis: Study Design Section 5.1 Study Description and Duration , Figure 2 Section 6.2.1 Inclusion Criteria, #7 Section 8.1 - Table 1 Schedule of Events (Screening, TCS Standardization, Baseline, and Treatment Period ) Revised Inclusion Criterion #9: At least 11 (of a total of 14) application s of a stable dose of topical emollient (moisturizer) during the 7 consecutive days immediately before the baseline visit. The criterion prior to this amendment requiring 100% compliance with application of a stable dose of topical emollient twice daily for the entire 7 consecutive days immediately before the baseline visit is overly restrictive for this patient population. This change would ensure that pediatric patients do not unnecessarily screen fail entry into this study.

Page 3 of 109 CONFIDENTIAL Change Section Changed Added rationale for the inclusion of a placebo treatment group in the study design and a description of the risks and benefits to patients assigned to the placebo treatment group. This change had previously been requested by the Czech Republic (Czechia) regulatory agency and had been included in a country -specific amendment, but i t is now being incorporated into the global protocol . Section 3.2.1 Rationale for Study Design Added a benefit -risk section for treatment of atopic dermatitis with dupilumab. This change had previously been requested by the Czechia regulatory agency and had been included in a country -specific amendment, and is now being incorporated into the global protocol. The section summarizes relevant previous Regeneron studies. It notes that the safety profile was consistent between pediatric and adult populations, a nd that dupilumab was efficacacious in all previous Regeneron trials. New Section 3.2.4 , Section 3.2.4.1 , Section 3.2.4.2 , and Section 3.2.4.3 Revised Figure 1 and its title to clarify that p atients randomized to dupilumab Q4W receive 300 mg dupilumab regardless of body weight (Arm B). Section 5.1 - Figure 1 Study Design Corrected the description of age limit of the study population from “aged ≥6 to <12 years at the time of baseline” to “aged ≥6 to <12 years at the time of screening” to be consistent with the wording in the Inclusion Criteria and other sections of the protocol . Section 6.2 Study Population Revised language for accelerated reporting of pregnancy to sponsor and the duration patients who are female of childbearing potential and sexually active are required to use highly effective methods of contraception after the last dose of study drug , to align with the current dupilumab label. Section 6.2.2 Exclusion Criteria, #31 Section 9.4.3 Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting Added body temperature to the list of post -dose vital signs to be assess ed.

Page 4 of 109 CONFIDENTIAL Change Section Changed Revised text to emphasize that the use of very -high- potency topical corticosteroids (TCS) is prohibited during the study, as their use is not recommended in patients under 12 years of age . Also included examples of very-high-potency TCS . Section 7.2 Background Treatment (6th bullet) Section 7.3 Rescue Treatment Section 7.4.2.1 Reason for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug Section 7.8.1 Prohibited Medications and Procedures (8th bullet) Included “injection observation ” for the every 4 week regimen in the Schedule of Events table, to identify the visits at which the observation occurs. Section 8.1 - Table 1 Schedule of Events (Screening, TCS Standardization, Baseline, and Treatment Period) Removed Footnote #18 (shown below) in the row for Ophthalmology Exam in the Schedule of Events table. “In the event the ophthalmology examination cannot be performed within the 35 -day screening visit window 1 the screening period can be extended by 4 weeks; however, the 14 -day interval between visits 2 and visits 3 may not be extended.” The rationale for removing this footnote is that all patients will now have an additional 4 weeks of screening . Section 8.1 - Table 1 Schedule of Events (Screening, TCS Standardization, Baseline, and Treatment Period) Section 8.1.1.1 Footnotes for Schedule of Events Table 1, original #18 (removed) Revised the adverse events of special interest definition for conjunctivitis, keratitis, and blepharitis . It originally read: Conjunctivitis (any type or etiology), keratitis, or blepharitis (only events that are either severe or serious or lasting ≥4 weeks will be reported as AESIs). The criteria “or lasting ≥4 weeks” was removed . In previous dupilumab trials for the tr eatment of atopic dermatitis, including one in adolescent patients, events of mild to moderate severity were not found to be clinically meaningful, even when lasting >28 days during the study, as they did not result in sequelae or treatment discontinuation . Section 9.4.3 Other Events that Require Accelerated Reporting Specified the list of potential major protocol violation types for the PPS, per request from the United States Food and Drug Administration . Clinical Study Protocol Synopsis: Statistical Plan – Efficacy Analysis Sets Section 10.3.1 Efficacy Analysis Sets Appendix 3 Potential Major Protocol Violations (added) Revision was made to clarify that the hierarchical testing order for the primary endpoint and key secondary endp oints is shown in Table 3 is an abbrevi ated, preliminary plan as it is stated that the complete hierarchy including all the secondary endpoints will be provided in the statistical analysis plan ( SAP).

To be determined Objectives The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the efficacy of dupilumab administered concomitantly with topical corticosteroids (TCS) in patients ≥6 years to <12 years of age with severe atopic dermatitis (AD). The secondary objective of the study is to assess the safet y of dupilumab administered concomitantly with TCS in patients ≥6 years to <12 years of age with severe AD. Study Design This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study to investigate the efficacy and safety of dupilumab administered concomitantly with TCS in pediatric patients with severe AD. The study population will include patients ≥6 years to <12 years of age with severe AD whose disease cannot be adequately controlled with topical medications. Approximately 330 study patients are planned to be randomized to 1 of the following treatment groups:  dupilumab every 2 weeks (Q2W) treatment group: 100 mg for patients <30 kg or 200 mg for patients ≥30 kg  dupilumab every 4 -weeks (Q4W) treatment group: 300 mg  placebo group The s tudy will consist of the following periods: screening of up to 9 weeks , a TCS standardization period of 2 weeks, treatment period of 16 weeks, and a follow -up period of 12 weeks. After the parents or legal guardians provide an informed assent (as appropria te), the patients will be assessed for study eligibility at the screening visit. During the screening period, systemic treatments for AD will be washed out, as applicable, according to the eligibility requirements. The use of TCS will be permitted during t he screening period at the discretion of the investigator. Starting on day -14, all patients will initiate a standardized TCS treatment regimen and will continue this regimen through the end of the study. Patients may be rescreened, unless the reason for the screen failure is related to failing the disease severity inclusion crite ria. Patients should apply moisturizers twice daily for at least 7 days before randomization and continue throughout the study. Patients who continue to meet eligibility criteria at baseline will undergo day 1/baseline assessments and will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio stratified by VV-RIM-00053769-2.0 Approved - 21 Nov 2018 GMT-5:00"

Patients with baseline weight ≥30 kg will receive Q2W SC injections of 200 mg dupilumab following a loading dose of 400 mg on day 1  dupilumab Q4W treatment group: Patients regardless of weight will receive Q4W SC injections of 300 mg dupilumab following a loading dose of 600 mg on day 1.  placebo treatment group: Patients will receive matching placebo (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the loading dose). In order to maintain blinding, t he patients in the <30 kg weight stratum will be randomly assigned to receive, in a 1:1 ratio, either Q2W SC injections of placebo (0.7 mL) matching the 100 mg dupilumab (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the loading dose) or Q4W S C injections of placebo (2 mL) matching the 300 mg dupilumab (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the loading dose). In the ≥30 kg weight stratum, the patients randomized to the placebo group will receive, in a 1:1 ratio, either Q2W SC injections of placebo (1.14 mL) matching the 200 mg dupilumab (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the loading dose) or Q4W SC injections of placebo (2 mL) matching the 300 mg dupilumab (including doubling the amount of placebo on day 1 to match the loading dose). During the treatment period, patients will have weekly in -clinic visits through week 4, then every 4 weeks in -clinic visits through week 16, with weekly telephone visits in between in -clinic visits. Parents/caregivers wil l be trained on injecting study drug during in -clinic visit 3 (day 1) to visit 7 (week 4). During weeks in which no in -clinic visit is scheduled, the parent/caregiver will administer study drug to the patient. In case the parent/caregiver does not want to administer study drug to patient, they may have the clinic staff administer all the study drug injections in the clinic. Safety, laboratory, and clinical assessments will be performed at specified clinic visits. The end of treatment period visit will occur at week 16. The co -primary endpoints will be assessed at this visit. Patients who participate in the study may subsequently be eligible to participate in an open -label extension (OLE) study. Study Duration The duration of the study for each patient is a pproximately 16 weeks, excluding the screening period, for patients entering the OLE and 28 weeks, excluding the screening period for patients who decline to enter the OLE.

Details about the error and why it may have been unblinding are not included in the protocol but will be described in the clinical study report. An additional approximately 90 patients will be added to the study to ensure that the original number of blinded patients for all treatment groups is available for sensitivity analyses that exclude the potentially unblinded patients. This will maintain study balance and power. The total sample size of the study will be up to approximately 330 patients (110 patients per group) , and approximately 262 patients (80, 91 and 91 in Q2W, Q4W and placebo group respectively) if excluding the potentially unblinded patients. With the sample size o f 330 patients or 262 patients, the power for the co-primary endpoints will be greater than 90%. Efficacy Analysis Sets: The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized patients. Efficacy analyses will be based on the treatment allocated at randomizati on (as randomized). All efficacy variables will be evaluated in the FAS, which will be considered to be the primary analysis set .

A preliminary list of potential major protocol violation s is provided in Appendix 3 and a final list will be generated prior to database lock . The PPS will also exclude potentially unblinded patients . The primary and co -primary endpoint s will also be evaluated in the PPS. Analysis Methods: Primary Efficacy Analyses The Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted by randomization strata (baseline weight group and region) will be used for analyzing the percentage of patients with IGA 0 or 1 at we ek 16 or percentage of patients with EASI -75 at week 16. The Mantel -Fleiss (MF) criterion will be checked, and if it is not met, sensitivity analyses including each stratification factor separately in CMH test will be conducted. To account for the impact of rescue treatment on the efficacy effect: For the primary efficacy endpoints (which are binary efficacy endpoints), if rescue treatment is used, the patient will be classified as a nonresponder from the time the rescue is used. If a patient withdraws fr om study, this patient will be counted as a nonresponder for endpoints after withdrawal. Sensitivity analysis using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach to determine patient’s status at week 16 will be conducted to assess the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis with regards to handling of missing data. The efficacy data will be set to missing after rescue treatment is used, then the LOCF method will be used to determine patients’ status at week 16. In addition, the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel method adjusted by randomization strata will also be performed on all observed data regardless if rescue treatment is used. A patient with missing data will be counted as a non -responder. Other sensitivity analyses may be conducted. Secondary Effic acy Analyses For binary endpoints, the secondary efficacy analysis will use the same approach as that used for the primary analysis.

Missing data from the FAS will be imputed 40 times to generate a complete dataset at each imputation by using the MI Statistical Analysis System (SAS) procedure. These complete datasets will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model with treatment, rando mization strata (region and weight group) and relevant baseline included in the model, and the SAS MIANALYZE procedure will be used to generate valid statistical inferences by combining results from these multiple analyses using Rubin’s formula.  To account for the impact of rescue treatment on the efficacy effect: If a patient receives rescue treatment, the efficacy data collected after rescue treatment is initiated will be treated as missing.  In addition to the MI method described previously, sensitivity analyses such as ANCOVA model with LOCF and MI method with ANCOVA model on all observed data regardless of rescue use will be conducted. Additional details on these sensitivity analyses will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).

INTRODUCTION Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as atopic eczema, is a pruritic skin condition characterized by a chronic, relapsing form of skin inflammation, a disturbance of the epidermal -barrier function associated with immune changes in the skin, and a high prevalence of immunoglobulin E (IgE) -mediated sensitization to food and environmental allergens (Bieber 2008 ). Atopic dermatitis is one of the most common skin disorders in infants and children ( Mortz 2015 ). The disease affects over 20% of children in many industrialized countries (Deckers 2012 ). A total of 45% of all cases of AD begin within the first 6 months of life, 60% begin during the first year, and 85% begin before 5 years of age (Kay 1994 ). Phase 3 of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (IS AAC) showed a 1 -year period preva lence rate for AD in the 6 to 7 year age group to be 15% or more in Australia, England, and Scandinavia (Asher 2006 ). A study conducted in the United States (US) in school -going children aged 5 to 9 years old showed similar prevalence rate of around 17% ( Laughter 2000 ). The clinical pattern of AD varies with age. Infants typically present with erythematous papules and vesicles on the cheeks, forehead, or scalp, which are exud ative and intensely pruritic. The childhood phase typically occurs from 2 years of age to puberty. Children present with lichenified papules and plaques representing the more chronic disease involving the hands, feet, wrists, ankles, and antecubital and popliteal regions. In adults, predominant areas of involvement include the flexural folds, the face and neck, the upper arms and back, and the dorsa of the hands, feet, fingers, and toes. The eruption is characterized by dry, scaling erythematous papules and plaques, and the formation of large lichenified plaques from lesional chronicity. The disease has been shown to have a marked impact on the quality of life (QOL) of pediatric patients, greater than that seen in other common skin disorders like psorias is and urticaria (Beattie 2006 ). A study comparing the impact on the QOL of family members of children suffering from eczema and type 1 diabetes found that all families of children with moderate to severe eczema had significantly h igher impact scores than those of diabetic children (Su 1997 ). Often severe, pruritus is a universal finding in AD and often results in sleep disruption, irritability, and generalized stress for both the affected patients as well a s family members (Kim 2012 ). Of particular interest in children is the phenomenon of “Atopic March” which is characterized by a typical sequence of progression of clinical signs of atopic disease. In general, the clinical signs of AD and of food allergies predate the development of asthma and allergic rhinitis, suggesting that AD is an “entry point” for subsequent allergic disease (Spergel 2003 ). Severity of AD is correlated with development of asthma and a llergic rhinitis (Zheng 2011 ). The prevalence of asthma in children 6 years and older who had developed eczema during the first 4 years of their life has been estimated to be around 35% (Van der Hulst 2007 ). In a prospective study on ‘Atopic March’ in which children with eczema during infancy were followed, 47% of patients had allergic rhino -conjunctivitis and 29% had asthma (Ekback 2014 ) by the age of 10 years. More severe skin dise ase is directly correlated with a higher risk of developing comorbidities (asthma, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, and mental health disorders) and is associated with more severe comorbidities (Silverberg 2013 ). The incidence of m ental health disorders like anxiety, VV-RIM-00053769-2.0 Approved - 21 Nov 2018 GMT-5:00"

Page 25 of 109 CONFIDENTIAL depression, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is also higher in children with AD (Yaghmaie 2013 ). The course of the disease in school -going children can be complicated by poten tially life -threatening complications like eczema herpeticum ( Luca 2012 ). Atopic dermatitis is caused by a complex interaction of genetics, defects in skin barrier function, environmental exposure, and immunologic responses. Type 2 helper T cell (Th2) -mediated immune response is believed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of AD. The skin lesions of AD are characterized by increased expression of proinflammation Th2 cytokines, such as interleukin (IL) -4 and IL -13, and by ski n infiltration of Th2 cells. The elevated IgE responses and eosinophilia observed in the majority of patients with AD reflects an increased expression of the Th2 cytokines IL -4 and IL -13 (Leung 1999 ). Type 2 helper T cell -associat ed cytokines regulate important barrier -related functions, such as epidermal cornification and production of antimicrobial proteins. These cytokines inhibit the production of major terminal differentiation proteins, such as loricrin, filaggrin, involucrin , and the antimicrobial proteins human beta defensin 2 and 3, which in turn, is associated with development of AD (Howell 2007, Guttman -Yassky 2011a, Guttman -Yassky 2011b ). The Th2 cytokines also act on keratinocytes and induce pro duction of chemokines, including chemokine (C -C motif) ligand 17 (also known as thymus and activation -regulated chemokine [TARC]), and chemokine (C -C motif) ligand 26 (also known as eotaxin -3), which are chemo -attractants for Th2 cells and eosinophils, thu s, perpetuating the inflammatory response. Since activation of IL -4 and IL -13 signaling precedes the release of proinflammatory mediators, antagonism of these cytokines has the potential to reduce the Th2 response and provide therapeutic benefit. There is currently a high unmet medical need for a safe and effective therapy for AD in young children. Nonpharmacological management of AD, which includes environmental control measures (eg, avoidance of antigen and skin irritants) and skin care measures (eg, ma intaining the hydration of the skin through the use of emollients) play a supportive role, especially in children with moderate -to-severe disease. Pharmacological management of AD in children is mainly limited to topical therapy with topical corticosteroi ds (TCS) and topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs). However, long -term use of TCS in children is not recommended because of the risk of irreversible skin atrophy, dyspigmentation, acneiform eruptions, and risks associated with systemic absorption (eg, gro wth retardation, hypothalamic pituitary axis effects, etc). Topical calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, are also used in AD as an alternative to or in combination with TCS. The more effective TCI products (tacrolimus 0.1%) are not approved for use in children aged 6 to 11 years old. Moreover, the use of TCI is frequently associated with skin irritation. Furthermore, a possible increased risk of malignancy (lymphoma and skin cancers) has been noted for TCIs (refer to products’ US prescribing information). Systemic agents are used off -label in children aged 6 to 11 years old (cyclosporine, systemic steroids, methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil). A recent survey conducted in Europe, “European TREatment of Severe At opic Eczema in Children Taskforce (TREAT)” found that approximately 70% of respondents initiated systemic therapy for children with severe AD (Proudfoot 2013 ). All of these systemic agents have significant side effects in children, including stunted growth, diabetes, cutaneous atrophy, hypertension, osteoporosis, and rebound exacerbation after discontinuation (corticosteroids), myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity (methotrexate), nephrotoxicity and hypertension (cyclosporine), increa sed risk of malignancies VV-RIM-00053769-2.0 Approved - 21 Nov 2018 GMT-5:00"

Page 26 of 109 CONFIDENTIAL (cyclosporine, azathioprine), and gastrointestinal disturbances and leucopenia (azathioprine). Moreover, a high proportion of patients in which disease is initially controlled by systemic agents suffer from relapse soon after thera py is discontinued ( Schmitt 2009 ). Dupilumab is a novel targeted immunoregulatory agent that selectively and simultaneously inhibits IL -4 and IL -13 signaling through the IL -4 receptor alpha subunit (IL -4Rα) by binding to the obligat e shared component (IL -4Rα) of the IL -4/IL-13 receptor complex. It is intended to inhibit key disease drivers to achieve clinical benefit without the side effects commonly observed with existing non -selective systemic immunosuppressants. Dupilumab, given subcutaneously (SC), is currently in clinical trials for multiple indications, including treatment of moderate -to-severe AD in patients intolerant of, or whose disease is not adequately controlled with, topical treatments. Overall, 7408 subjects have been enrolled into the dupilumab development program (completed and ongoing studies) as of 30 September 2016: 222 healthy volunteers, 4182 patients with AD, 2909 patients with asthma, 60 patients with nasal polyposis, and 35 patients with eosinophilic esophagi tis. In completed or unblinded studies, 3927 subjects have received dupilumab: 202 healthy volunteers, 2853 patients with AD, 842 patients with asthma and 30 patients with nasal polyposis. Taking into account patients exposed to dupilumab in blinded studie s, the total number of patients exposed to dupilumab is over 5,000. Further, 1 clinical study with dupilumab in the pediatric population has been completed at the time of this protocol development; a phase 2 study (R668 -AD-1412) investigating the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, and exploratory efficacy of dupilumab in patients aged ≥6 to <18 years with AD, and an open -label extension (OLE) study to assess the long -term safety and efficacy of dupilumab in patients aged ≥6 to <18 years with AD (R668 -AD-1434) is ongoing. A total of 78 pediatric patients were exposed to dupilumab at doses of either 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg (single dose, weight dependent) followed by 4 weekly doses of 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg (weight -dependent, once a week [QW] regimen). The safety data gathered from these pediatric studies are summarized in Section 3.2.3 . A total of 1,379 adult patients with moderate -to-severe AD were enrolled in the identically designed SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 phase 3 adult studies. Patients were enrolled if they were not adequately controlled with topical medications, or if topical treatment w as not medically advisable. Patients were randomized into 1 of 3 treatment groups: dupilumab 300 mg SC QW, dupilumab 300 mg SC every 2 weeks (Q2W), or placebo for 16 weeks following an initial dupilumab loading dose of 600 mg SC, or placebo. Results at 1 6 weeks included the following: For SOLO 1 and SOLO 2, respectively, 37% and 36% of patients who received dupilumab 300 mg QW, and 38% and 36% of patients who received dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, achieved clearing or near -clearing of skin lesions (IGA 0 or 1), compared to 10% and 8.5% with placebo (p<0.0001). This was the primary endpoint of the study in the US and one of the primary endpoints in the European Union (EU). For SOLO 1 and SOLO 2, respectively, 52.5% and 48% of patients who received dupilumab 300 mg QW, and 51% and 44% of patients who received dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, achieved EASI -75 compared to 15% and 12% with placebo (p<0.0001). This was the key secondary endpoint in the US and one of the primary endpoints in the EU. VV-RIM-00053769-2.0 Approved - 21 Nov 2018 GMT-5:00"

Page 27 of 109 CONFIDENTIAL For SOLO 1 and SOLO 2, respec tively, the percent improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) from baseline was 72% and 69% in patients who received the 300 mg QW dose, and 72% and 67% for patients who received dupilumab 300 mg Q2W, compared to 38% and 31% for placebo patients (p<0.0001). Nonclinical repeat -dose toxicity studies and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have shown a lack of any general or reproductive toxicology and postnatal effects observed with anti-IL-4Rα surrogate antibodies in cynomolgus monkeys and mice. These nonclinical data, together with the clinical safety profile of dupilumab to date, support the evaluation of dupilumab in pediatric patients. Dupilumab was shown to be generally well tolerated with a favorable safety profile in concluded phase 3 studies in adult patients with moderate -to-severe AD (SOLO 1, SOLO 2). The overall incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was similar across all treatment groups (300 mg QW, 300 mg Q2W, placebo). The incidence of any treatment -emer gent serious adverse event (SAEs) was higher in the placebo groups than in the dupilumab groups. The incidence of any TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation was similar across all groups. There is no indication that dupilumab treatment incr eased the incidence of acute allergic reactions overall. The incidence of treatment -emergent adverse events of special interest (AESI) of acute allergic reactions requiring treatment was <1% in dupilumab -treated patients and lower than in placebo -treated patients. In the SOLO studies, there was no report of anaphylaxis or serum sickness in dupilumab -treated patients. There was no increase in infections in general, serious infections, or any of the infection AESIs with dupilumab compared to placebo. Furt her, the incidence of severe infection and opportunistic infection AESI was higher in placebo -treated patients than in dupilumab -treated patients. Additional background information on the study drug and development program can be found in the Investigator’ s Brochure. 2. STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1.

Hypothesis In pediatric patients ≥6 years to <12 years old who are suffering f rom severe AD that is inadequately responsive to topical therapies (TCS with/without TCIs), treatment with dupilumab, in addition to TCS, will result in clinically relevant and statistically significant incremental benefit versus treatment with TCS alone, as measured by proportion of patients who achieve Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear disease) and Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) -75 (at least 75% reduction in EASI score from baseline). 3.2. Rationale 3.2.1. Rationale for Study Design This study is part of the pediatric clinical development plan for dupilumab in AD. The primary purpose of the study is to provide data on the use of dupilumab concomitantly with TCS to support regulatory approval in patients, ≥6 years to <12 years of age, with severe AD. Since TCS represent the mainstay of pharmacological treatment of AD, many patients may use dupilumab in combination with TCS. Hence, the use of topical therapy as background medication will allow the study design to refle ct more closely the anticipated real -life use of dupilumab. This design seeks to maximize clinical benefit for patients enrolled in the study. Although the target population consists of patients who are inadequately responsive to TCS, these patients are s till expected to receive some benefit from the use of TCS. Data from phase 3 studies in adults (R668 -AD-1334, R668 -AD-1416, and R668 -AD-1224) in which dupilumab was evaluated both as monotherapy (R668 -AD-1334 and R668 -AD-1416) and concomitantly with TCS ( R668 -AD-1224) showed that for certain clinical endpoints, the combination regimen was more efficacious than monotherapy. Moreover, this design will also generate data on the potential steroid -sparing effect of dupilumab. The 16 -week treatment duration is the same as in 2 of the adult pivotal trials (R668 -AD-1416 and R668 -AD-1334). This duration has been chosen because it is expected that the vast majority of patients will achieve maximum therapeutic effect for dupilumab by this time. Moreover, in previo us studies, the selected dupilumab dose regimens have been shown to achieve steady state concentration before the end of this period. The 12 -week follow -up period is based on the expected PK of dupilumab after the last dose, ie, the time for serum concent rations to decline to nondetectable levels (below the lower limit of quantification) in most patients. The co -primary endpoints chosen in the study (proportion of patients achieving IGA 0 or 1 and proportion of patients with ≥75% reduction in EASI from bas eline [EASI -75] at week 16) are the same as those used in the adult pivotal studies (R668 -AD-1334 and R668 -AD-1416). These endpoints are both investigator -assessed outcome measures of objective AD signs, which are broadly validated in drug development for this indication. Based on prior discussions with health authorities for the pivotal adult AD studies (R668 -AD-1334 and R668 -AD-1416), it is expected that different health authorities will request different primary endpoints for this study (for example, t he US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested IGA 0/1 as the primary VV-RIM-00053769-2.0 Approved - 21 Nov 2018 GMT-5:00"
28,page_28,"Clinical Study Protocol R668 -AD-1652 Amendment 3 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc . Page 29 of 109 CONFIDENTIAL endpoint in the adult AD program while European Medicines Agency (EMA) requested both EASI -75 and IGA 0/1 as co -primary endpoints). Eczema Area and Severity Index has been validated in the pediatric population including in patients aged 6 to 11 years old in a prior study (Barbier 2004 ). These endpoints were included in the Pediatric Investigation Plan and Pediatric Study Plan and agreed to by Paediatric Commi ttee and FDA, respectively. As the efficacy and safety of dupilumab for the treatment of AD has not yet been established in this age group, a placebo control is a scientifically essential element of the study design to enable adequate assessment and interpretation of the treatment effect and safety profile. It is particularly relevant for pediatric patients, in whom spontaneous remission of AD over time has been described. Several features of the protocol are intended to mitigate any potential adver se effects in patients randomized to the placebo group:  Mandatory requirement for use of concomitant topical corticosteroids  Starting on day -14, all patients will initiate a standardized TCS treatment regimen with a medium -potency TCS that may be adjusted based on clinical response. T opical corticosteroids represent the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment of AD and ha ve been shown to have some benefit even in a patient population selected for their inadequate response to TCS.  Availability of rescue treatm ent  Patients who experience AD exacerbations or intolerable symptoms may receive rescue treatment with a range of treatments available to all patients with AD (except for very -high-potency TCS , as their use is not recommended in patients <12 years of age ): high-potency TCS, systemic corticosteroids, and nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs  Open-Label Extension Study (OLE)  Patients who participate in the study may subsequently be eligible to participate in an OLE study. All patients will be offered the opp ortunity to screen for entry into the OLE study at the end of the treatment period (week 16). Additional details concerning eligibility for the OLE can be found in Section 7.9. As described in Section 5.3.1 , an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), will monitor patient safety by conducting formal reviews of accumulated safety data on a program -wide level . 3.2.2. Rationale for Dose Selection The dose justification for pediatric patients aged ≥6 years to <12 years is based on the observed efficacy and safety in the dose ranging study in ad ult AD patients (R668 -AD-1021), the observed efficacy and safety in the phase 3 monotherapy studies in adult AD patients (R668 -AD-1334 and R668 -AD-1416), the observed PK data, efficacy and safety results in a pediatric AD study of patients ≥6 to <18 years old (R668 -AD-1412). The selection of these dosing regimens is further supported by population PK modeling. The adult dose -ranging study evaluated dupilumab dose regimens of 300 mg QW, 300 mg Q2W, 300 mg once every 4 weeks (Q4W), 200 mg Q2W, and 100 mg Q4W versus placebo, administered for 16 weeks. All 5 dose regimens were efficacious. The mean pharmacodynamic VV-RIM-00053769-2.0 Approved - 21 Nov 2018 GMT-5:00"

Page 30 of 109 CONFIDENTIAL (PD) effect/efficacy of dupilumab (represented by change in EASI, IGA, and Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale [NRS] scores) at week 16 generally align ed in the same rank order as the total monthly dose and the mean concentrations of functional dupilumab at week 16. Thus, the 300 mg QW regimen was consistently the most efficacious dose regimen in this study across multiple endpoints, followed closely by the 300 mg Q2W dose regimen. Differences in the efficacy and safety outcomes between the 300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W were relatively small. The 200 mg Q2W and 300 mg Q4W doses also showed good efficacy responses but were numerically inferior to the 300 mg Q2W and 300 mg QW regimens for the majority of efficacy endpoints. The efficacy of the 100 mg Q4W regimen (100 mg total monthly dose) appeared to be sub-optimal Study R668 -AD-1412 was a phase 2a, multicenter, open -label, ascending -dose, sequential -cohort study investigating the safety, tolerability, PK, immunogenicity, and efficacy of single -dose and repeat -doses of dupilumab administered SC in pediatric patients with moderate to severe AD (for adolescents ≥12 to <18 years old) or severe AD (for school -going children ≥6 to <12 years old) that was not adequately controlled with topical treatments. The 2 assessed dose regimens at 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg correspond to the weight normalized dose in adults at 150 mg and 300 mg, respectively. Dupilumab administered as single and repeated weekly doses of 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg for 4 weeks was generally well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile in both pediatric age groups included in that study. There was a higher incidence of TEAEs following single and repeated weekly administration of 4 mg/kg compared to 2 mg/kg in both age -groups. This was driven by a higher incidence of nasopharyngitis and skin infections in the 4 mg/kg dose arm versus the 2 mg/kg dose arm. However, most of the adverse events (AEs) were mild in intensity, transient in nature, and not related to study drug. The most common AE reported after both single doses and repeated weekly doses was nasopharyngitis. In children aged ≥6 to <12 years, dupilumab administered as a single dose of either 2 mg/k g or 4 mg/kg, in the study R668 -AD-1412, induced a significant and rapid reduction of disease activity in patients at week 2 (37% and 33% reduction in EASI score from baseline for 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg doses, respectively). Repeated weekly doses of dupiluma b led to a further improvement in disease severity in patients in both dose groups (76% and 63% reduction in EASI score from baseline for 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg doses, respectively, at week 12). There did not appear to be a clear dose response, as the 2 dose groups showed similar efficacy on the various endpoints evaluated during the study. The small sample size may have limited the precision of this study, but these data are consistent with saturation of the IL -4 receptor a fter 4 weekly doses of either 2 mg/kg or 4 mg/kg. The collective clinical data on the exposure versus efficacy and safety in the adults and pediatric population as observed to date supports a similar exposure -response relationship for efficacy and safety between the adult and pediatric pop ulations down to 6 years of age and justify the approach of selecting dose regimens for this study based on the criteria of matching adult exposure. To account for body size difference in the pediatric population and taking into account the observed large therapeutic indices of dupilumab, a tiered fixed dosing regimen was chosen over weight based (mg/kg) dosing for ongoing development. This approach reduces the risk of dosing errors that can occur with weight -based dosing, as well as allowing for dosing co nvenience by simplifying administration using a prefilled syringe/device.

30,page_30,"Clinical Study Protocol R668 -AD-1652 Amendment 3 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc . Page 31 of 109 CONFIDENTIAL A population PK model was used to describe the exposure of dupilumab in the population identified in this protocol. This model, initially based on drug concentration data from studi es conducted in adults, was further informed by the exposure data of the study(s) conducted in pediatric patients (R668 -AD-1412). The PK modeling for dupilumab has shown weight to be the most important covariate influencing exposure, with exposure being inversely correlated with body weight. Outside of the effect of body weight on PK, the exis ting data do not suggest an age-related effect on exposure. Data gathered from NHANES (n=1269) show that median weight in the children aged 6 to11 years old is = 32 kg (Q1=25, Q3=42). Simulations from the PK model suggest that the adult dose regimens (300 mg QW and 300 mg Q2W) may lead to systemic exposure in these children that is greater than the maximum exposure observed in adults. Hence, these doses are not supp orted by the safety data obtained in adults and will not be studied in children. For the 200 mg Q2W regimen in children aged ≥6 to <12 years old who weigh >30 kg, the simulated exposure substantially overlaps with the efficacious exposure in adults from st udies R668 -AD-1021, R668 -AD-1334, R668 -AD-1416 and R668 -AD-1224 (300 mg Q2W and QW). In addition, in study DRI12544 (a phase 2b study in patients with moderate to severe uncontrolled asthma) (300 mg Q2W) a strongly positive benefit -risk was ident ified. He nce, the proposed 200 mg Q2W dosing regimen for children aged ≥6 to <12 years old weighing >30 kg is expected to have a significant clinical benefit with an appropriate safety profile, under the assumption that PK/PD relationship is similar in pediatrics a nd adult patients. A dose regimen of 100 mg Q2W SC has not been evaluated to date in the dupilumab program. However, based on simulations from the PK model, the use of 100 mg Q2W is expected to provide mean exposure in children ≥6 to <12 years old who weig h <30 kg that is similar to that for 200 mg Q2W in children >30 kg, thereby supporting the use of this regimen in the lower weight group. Moreover, the 100 mg dose can be delivered using a lower volume of injection. Since volume of injection has been show n to be an important factor impacting the tolerability of SC injections (Heise 2014 ), the smaller injection volume associated with the100 mg injection may offer some advantage in this population. The 300 mg Q4W regimen was chosen t o be included as a dosing option with less frequent injections. With this regimen, in children ≥6 to <12 years old and weight >30 kg, simulated dupilumab exposure at steady -state, specifically C max, C trough, and weekly area under the curve (AUC) were lowe r than for the 200 mg Q2W. Study R668 -AD-1021 demonstrated that efficacy for the 300 mg Q4W regimen was statistically superior to placebo in adults. Pharmacokinetic simulations have shown that in children with weight >30 kg, the steady -state exposure was higher for the 300 mg Q4W regimen than in adults with the same regimen, but is not expected to exceed that for adults receiving 300 mg Q2W. In children with weight <30 kg, simulated mean weekly AUC at steady -state for the 300 mg Q4W regimen was similar to that in adults receiving 300 mg Q2W, while C max was higher and Ctrough was lower. Data gathered from this dose regimen will enable PK/PD modeling to better characterize the exposure -response relationship in pediatric patients. A less frequent dosing regimen is expected to enhance compliance, especially in a pediatric population. The administration of the loading dose of dupilumab will allow systemic concentrations to reach effective concentrations faster, and potentially reduce the time to onset of cli nical effect.

Safety Considerations R668 -AD-1412 was a phase 2 study to evaluate the PK and safety of dupilumab in patients aged ≥6 years to <18 years, with moderate -to-severe AD. Dupilumab administered as single and repeated weekly doses of 2 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg for 4 weeks was generally well tolerated with an acceptable safety profile in both pediatric age groups (12 to 17 years old and 6 to 11 years old) included in this study. There was a higher incidence of TEAEs after administration of a single dose o f 4 mg/kg as compared to 2mg/kg dose in both age -groups. Similarly, there was a higher incidence of TEAEs after administration of repeated weekly doses of 4 mg/kg as compared to repeated weekly doses of 2 mg/kg in both age -groups. This was driven by a hi gher incidence of nasopharyngitis and skin infections in the 4 mg/kg as compared to 2 mg/kg dose arm. The most common AE reported after both single doses and repeated weekly doses was nasopharyngitis. In children 12 to <18 years old, there were 2 SAEs rep orted in each dose group (in the 2 mg/kg group, the SAEs reported were palpitations and infected AD; in the 4 mg/kg group, the SAEs reported were staphylococcal skin infection and infected AD). In children 6 to 11 years old, 2 patients in the 4 mg/kg dose group had serious TEAEs (2 events of exacerbation of AD, septic arthritis of the hip joint, and infected AD). None of these serious TEAEs was assessed by the investigators as drug -related. The events of infected AD and staphylococcal skin infections occurred in patients who were not being treated with dupilumab at time of onset of the SAE (patients were either in follow -up period of part A or in follow -up period of part B). It is well known that a very high proportion of patients with AD have skin colon ization (Ong 2010 ) and patients with AD are prone to developing skin infections. Dupilumab, by treating AD, should lead to a reduction in skin infections. This is supported by data from phase 3 trials in adults with AD in which th e incidence of serious and severe infections was numerically higher in the placebo group as compared to dupilumab (0.5% to 1% dupilumab and 2% to 3% placebo). Positive anti -drug antibody (ADA) was observed in 50 patients (64.9 %) at any time, 31 of which (40.3% out of total) were categorized as persistent treatment -emergent ADA. The rate of occurrence of persistent ADA were similar across cohorts with a trend of higher rates in the adolescents compared with school -going children. Six patients (12.0%) had high titers (>10,000), 4 from the 2 mg/kg groups and 2 from 4 mg/kg groups. Within each age group, there also seemed to be a trend for higher incidence of persistent ADA in lower dose cohorts as compared to higher dose cohorts. Dupilumab concentrations i n patients with high titers were markedly reduced compared to those with a negative response, or low or moderate titers. These patients had an inferior clinical response to the study drug as compared to the overall study population. The high titer ADAs w ere not associated with any systemic symptoms of hypersensitivity in these patients, although one of these patients did experience an injection site reaction, which was mild in intensity. Standard safety monitoring used in previous trials with dupilumab is planned to be conducted during this study. An internal safety monitoring team will be reviewing blinded data at regular intervals during the study to monitor the safety of patients. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) overseeing the entire d upilumab clinical development will be in place for the duration of the study to monitor the safety of the patients and to provide the sponsor with appropriate recommendations in due time to ensure the safety of the patients.

Benefits The efficacy and safety of dupilumab in adults was evaluated in 4 randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled studies and 1 dose-ranging study in patients with mode rate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. In all studies, dupilumab treatment consistently reduced both the extent and severity of lesions as well as the severity of pruritus . The first clinical study of dupilumab in pediatric patients aged 6 years to <18 years o ld has been completed (R668 -AD-1412). Dupilumab administered as single and repeated weekly doses provided significant clinical benefit to pediatric patients in both age groups (6 years to 11 years and 12 to <18 years) consistent with that observed in adul ts. 3.2.4.2. Risks Of the adverse drug reactions identified in the dupilumab adult AD clinical program, injection site reactions were very common (≥10%). Common adverse reactions (≥1% and <10%) included conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, eye pruritus, blepha ritis, oral herpes, eosinophilia , and headache . Serum sickness and serum sickness -like reactions occurred very rarely (<0.01%) (Dupixent [SmPC], 2017). In the pediatric trial, the safety profile was consistent with that reported in adults. There were no new safety signal s detected with dupilumab in the pediatric population. One serious case each of serum sickness and serum sickness -like reaction (both associated with high ADA titers) were reported in adult AD studies. Additionally, there has been 1 report of anaphylaxis considered related to study drug by the investigator in an asthma study (Dupilumab [Investigator Brochure, 2017]. No AEs of systemic hypersensitivity were reported in the pediatric study. In study R668 -AD-1652, patients will be monitored at the trial site for 2 hours post-dose for the first 3 visits at which study drug is administered to facilitate detection and treatment of any immediate hypersensitivity reactions to the study drug . A hig her incidence of conjunctivitis -related events has been observed in dupilumab -treated subjects as compared to placebo in the AD studies. A predominant number of these cases were non-serious, mild to moderate in severity, reported recovered/recovering during the active study periods , and infrequently led t o study drug discontinuation. Neither a consistent dose response nor a consistent time to onset of these events ha ve been observed . Similarly, a higher incidence of injection site reactions has been observed in the dupilumab treated subjects, consistent w ith the subcutaneous injection of a protein biologic. There have been no serious events of ISR, and these events have infrequently led to study drug discontinuation (Dupilumab [Investigator Brochure, 2017]). 3.2.4.3. Risk/Benefit Conclusion The safety data availab le to date , in conjunction with the risk monitoring and mitigation strategies in the study protocol, and the clinical benefit of dupilumab demonstrated in multiple AD studies , support a favorable benefit -risk profile for dupilumab .

Subcutaneous injection sites of the study drug should be alternated among the different quadrants of the abdomen (avoiding navel and waist areas), upper thighs, and upper arms so that the same site is not injected for 2 consecutive administrations. To allow for adequate assessment of possible injection site reactions, study dr ug should be administered only into areas of normal -looking skin (for patients with 100% BSA involvement, the injection should be administered into as near normal looking skin as possible). Instructions for recording and reporting injection site reactions will be provided in the study reference manual. Parents/caregivers will have the option to administer study drug outside the study site during weeks in which no in -clinic visit is scheduled (for patients receiving Q2W treatment). The study staff will tra in the parent/caregiver on preparation and administration of study drug on day 1 and will administer the first of the 2 injections required for the loading dose. The parent/caregiver will administer the second injection required for the loading dose under the supervision of the clinic staff. The parent/caregiver will administer study drug under the supervision of the clinic staff at visits 5 and 7 (weeks 2 and 4, respectively) and at other in -clinic visits. Patients will be monitored at the study site fo r a minimum of 2 hours after the first 3 doses of study drug (visits 3 [day 1], 5 [week 2], and 7 [week 4] for patients receiving Q2W treatment and visits 3 [day 1], 7 [week 4], and 11 [week 8] for patients receiving Q4W treatment); vital signs (sitting bl ood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate , and body temperature ) and AE assessments will be done at 30 minutes (±10 minutes) post dose and then at 2 hours (±15 minutes).

Background Treatment All patients should apply moisturizers (emollients) at least twice daily for at least the 7 consecutive days immediately before randomization. After randomization, patients are required to continue to apply moisturizers throughout the study (all 28 weeks where applicable). However, to allow adequate assessment of skin dryness, moisturizers should not be applied for at least 8 hours before each clinic visit. All types of moisturizers are permitted, but patients may not initiate treatment with prescription moisturizers (eg, ceramide containing products like epice ram®) or moisturizers containing additives (ceramide, hyaluronic acid, urea, filaggrin degradation products) during the screening period or during the study. Patients may continue using stable doses of such moisturizers if initiated before the screening v isit. Starting on day -14, all patients are required to initiate treatment with TCS using a standardized regimen according to the following guidelines:  Apply medium -potency TCS once daily to areas with active lesions. Based on investigator discretion, low -potency TCS may be used once daily on areas of thin skin (face, neck, intertriginous, and genital areas, areas of skin atrophy, etc.) or for areas where continued treatment with medium -potency TCS is considered unsafe.  Once the patient achieves an IGA s core of 2 or less, decrease the frequency of use of medium -potency TCS to 3 times per week, and then stop once lesions are clear (IGA 0). Patients should be instructed to use TCS only on active lesions, and to stop use of TCS if lesions clear completely in between clinic visits.  If lesions return, reinstitute treatment with medium -potency TCS, with the same step-down approach described above upon lesion resolution.  In case there are signs of local (eg, impending skin atrophy), or systemic TCS toxicity with medium -potency steroids, patients should be switched to low -potency steroids.  For lesions persisting or worsening under daily treatment with medium -potency TCS, patients may be treated (rescued) with high -potency TCS (super -potent/ very -high- potency steroi ds are not allowed even for rescue), unless higher potency TCS are considered unsafe (a potent TCS should normally be restricted to use on non -delicate skin sites [excluding face, flexures, groin], and should not be used for a prolonged period in order to prevent the development of cutaneous atrophy and adrenal axis suppression. Low -potency steroids should normally be used for delicate skin sites (face, flexures, groin) during these flares.  A list of steroids that can be used during the study will be prov ided to the investigators as part of the study manual. The use of very -high potency or superpotent TCS is prohibited during the study , as their use is not recommended in patients under 12 years of age. If patients have tolerance issues with any of these steroids, and/or to the excipients in a particular formulation (eg, hypersensitivity), or if they are not commercially available, they may substitute with products of the same potency from the list provided in the study manual. It is recommended that patie nts use triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% cream, fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% cream, or clobetasone butyrate 0.05% for medium potency, and hydrocortisone acetate 1% VV-RIM-00053769-2.0 Approved - 21 Nov 2018 GMT-5:00"

If rescue with TCS is needed, it is recommended that patients use momet asone furoate 0.1% ointment as high -potency steroid. If patients have tolerance issues with any of these steroids or if they are not commercially available, they may substitute with products of the same potency from the list provided in the study referenc e manual.  A 60 -minute interval between the application of emollients and TCS is recommended, wherever applicable.  Patients will return TCS tubes at each clinic visit through week 16, and these tubes will be weighed by the site staff to determine the actu al amount of TCS used. 7.3. Rescue Treatment Rescue treatment for AD may be provided to patients during the study. Investigators will be required to perform an IGA assessment prior to starting rescue treatment and initiate rescue treatment only in patients who either have an IGA score = 4, or have intolerable symptoms. If possible, investigators are encouraged to consider rescue initially with topical treatment (eg, high-potency TCS) and to escalate to systemic medications only for patients who do not respond adequately after at least 7 days of topical treatment. Patients may continue study treatment if rescue consists of topical medications. The use of very -high-potency or superpotent TCS is prohibited in this study, even as rescue treatment , as their use is not recommended in patients under 12 years of age. Very -high-potency topical corticosteroids include:  Betamethasone dipropionate augmented 0.05% ointment  Clobetasol propionate 0.05% solution, foam, cream or ointment  Diflorasone diacetate 0.05% ointment  Halobetasol propionate 0.05% cream or ointment Patients who receive systemic corticosteroids or systemic non -steroidal immunosuppressive drugs (eg, cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate -mofetil, azathioprine, etc) as rescue medication during the study w ill be discontinued permanently from the study drug. All patients will be asked to complete the scheduled study visits and assessments whether or not they complete study treatment and whether or not they receive rescue treatment for AD. Investigators should make every attempt to conduct efficacy and safety assessments (eg, disease severity scores, safety laboratory tests) immediately before administering any rescue treatment. An unscheduled visit may be used for this purpose, if necessary.

Study Drug Discontinuation Patient s who permanently discontinue from study drug and who do not withdraw from the study will be asked to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits per the visit schedule. Patient s who opt to withdraw from the study will be asked to complete study assessments, per Section 8.1. 7.4.2.1. Reasons for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug Study drug dosing will be permanently di scontinued in the event of:  Anaphylactic reaction or other severe systemic reaction to dupilumab  Diagnosis of a malignancy during study  Evidence of pregnancy  Any infection that is opportunistic, such as active tuberculosis and other infections whose nature or course may suggest an immuno -compromised status  Severe laboratory abnormalities that are deemed to be related to dupilumab:  Neutrophil count ≤0.5 × 103/μL  Platelet count ≤50 × 103/μL  ALT and/or AST values greater than 3 × ULN with total bilirubin >2 × ULN (unless elevated bilirubin is related to confirmed Gilbert’s Syndrome)  Confirmed AST and/or ALT >5 × ULN (for more than 2 weeks)  Treatment with any prohibited concomitant medication or procedure ( Section 7.8.1 ). NOTE: The use of TCI is prohibited during the 2 -week TCS standardization period leading up the baseline visit, and the treatment and follow -up periods. The use of very-high-potency or superpotent TCS is not allowed throughout the study (as their use is not recommended in patients under 12 years of age ). However, high -potency TCS can be used as rescue. In this situation, the study drug will be continued. 7.4.2.2. Reasons for Temporary Discontinua tion of Study Drug Study drug dosing may be temporarily discontinued in the event of:  Clinically important laboratory abnormalities, such as:  ALT or AST 3 × ULN but ≤5 × ULN  Neutrophil count <1.5 × 103/µL but >0.5 × 103/µL  Platelet count ≤100 × 103/µL but >50 × 103/µL  CPK >5 × ULN  Serum creatinine >1.5 × ULN  Eosinophils >5000/ μL VV-RIM-00053769-2.0 Approved - 21 Nov 2018 GMT-5:00"
49,page_49,"Clinical Study Protocol R668 -AD-1652 Amendment 3 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc . Page 50 of 109 CONFIDENTIAL  Severe laboratory abnormalities (as noted in Section 7.4.2.1 ) where a ca usal relationship to dupilumab can be reasonably excluded (ie, an alternative cause is evident). In these cases, study treatment will be discontinued while the clinical circumstances are being assessed but it may be resumed when the laboratory parameters n ormalize sufficiently. A decision to resume treatment will be made jointly by the investigator and medical monitor.  Other intercurrent illnesses or major surgery  An infection that requires parenteral treatment with antibiotic, antifungal, antiviral, antiparasitic, or antiprotozoal agents, or requires oral treatment with such agents for longer than 2 weeks After the condition leading to suspension of dosing normalizes sufficiently, study treatment may resume at the d iscretion of the principal investigator in consultation with the medical monitor. A decision to discontinue study drug and/or to reinstitute study treatment should be discussed with the medical monitor. Note that dosing may NOT be resumed if patient met co nditions for permanently discontinuing study drug described in Section 7.3. The investigator may suspend study treatment at any time, even without c onsultation with the medical monitor, if the urgency of the situation requires immediate action and if this is determined to be in the patient’s best interest. However, the medical monitor should be contacted as soon as possible in any case of study drug d iscontinuation. Resumption of study treatment after temporary discontinuation should always be discussed with the medical monitor. 7.5. Management of Acute Reactions Acute systemic reactions following injection of study drug (SC) should be treated using clinica l judgment to determine the appropriate response according to typical clinical practice. 7.6. Method of Treatment Assignment Approximately 330 patients will be randomized , stratified by weight group (<30 kg or ≥30 kg) and region (North America , Europe), to 1 of the treatment groups described in Section 5.1 according to a central randomization scheme provided by an interactive voice response system (IVRS)/interactive web r esponse system (IWRS) to the designated study pharmacist (or qualified designee). 7.6.1. Blinding With the exception of the IDMC members and the provisions in Section 7.6.2 , this study will remain blinded to all individuals until the prespecified unblinding to conduct the primary analyses. Blinded study drug kits coded with a medication numbering system will be used. In order to maintain the blind, lists linking these codes with product lot numbers will not be accessible to individuals involved in study conduct. Anti-drug antibody and drug concentration results will not be communicated to the sites, and the sponsor’s operational team will not have access to results associated with patient identification until after the final database lock.

Patient Assessment of Prurit us Using Worst Itch Scale The worst itch scale is a simple assessment tool that patients will use to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch). This is an 11 -point scale (0 to 10) in which 0 indicates no itching while 10 indicates worst itching possibl e. Patients will be asked the following 2 questions: “What was the worst itch you had today?” “What was the worst itch you had last night?” Patients will be asked to provide answers to these 2 questions daily throughout the entire study (screening period, treatment period, and follow -up period; see time point in Section 8.1). Both questions will be answered in the evening (it is re commended that the questions be answered and the responses provided in the diary in the 6:00 PM to 11:00 PM local time window). The daily worst itch score will be calculated as the worse of the scores for the 2 questions. Patients will be instructed on us ing the patient diary to record their worst itch score at the screening and baseline visits. Clinical sites will check and remind patients to complete the diary at each visit. This questionnaire measures concept(s), which are known only/best to the patient suffering from AD. As such the questionnaire is designed for self -report. Where possible the patient should read and complete the questionnaire alone. Where required, a caregiver (parent or other) can read the questions and response options aloud to the person with AD. However, it is important that the patient’s selected responses to the questions are entered directly into the questionnaire. The caregiver must not influence or question the response given by the person with AD. This should be communicat ed to caregivers during the first visit. A field to indicate whether the question and response options were read out to the patient by caregiver has been added to the first page of the diary/questionnaire. 8.2.2.2. Patient Global Impression of Disease Patients w ill rate their disease based on the 5 -level scale as follows: In general, how itchy have you been during the last 7 days?  Not itchy at all  A little itchy  Medium itchy  Pretty itchy  Very itchy Patients will undergo this assessment at time points according to Section 8.1.

Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index The CDLQI is a validated questionnaire designed to measure the impact of skin disease on the QOL in children (Lewis -Jones 1995 ). The aim of the questionnaire is to measure how much a patient’s skin problem has affected the patient o ver a recall period of the past week. To complete the questionnaire, patients need to provide responses to 10 questions (the questions focus on domains such as symptoms feelings associated with disease, the impact of the disease on leisure, school or holi days, personal relationships, sleep, and side effects of treatment for the skin disease. The instrument has a recall period of 7 days. Nine of the 10 questions are scored as follows:  Very much = 3  Quite a lot = 2  Only a little = 1  Not at all = 0  Quest ion unanswered = 0 Question 7 has an additional possible response (prevented school), which is assigned a score of 3.

Patient Oriented Eczema Measure The POEM is a 7 -item, validated questionnaire used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess disease symptoms in children and adults (Charman 2004 ). The format is a response to 7 items (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding , and weeping) based on frequency of these disease symptoms during the past week (ie, 0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = all days) with a scoring system of 0 to 28; the total score reflects disease -related morbidity. The questionnaire will be administered at time points according to Section 8.1. This questionnaire asks the caregiver to report their perception of p atient’s AD symptoms. It is therefore completed by the caregiver. To ensure consistency in perception over longitudinal administration and to minimize respondent variability, it is important that the same caregiver complete the questionnaire at each time point. This should be communicated to caregivers during consent and prior to the first completion of the questionnaire.

Dermatitis Family Index The impact on family life has been documented in families of children with very severe AD. The DFI was the first instrument assessing the impact of having a child with AD on family QOL (Lawson 1998 ). The 10 -item disease specific questionnaire was formed after ethnographical interviews and focus groups revealed the areas of family QO L affected by AD. The self-administered instrument is completed by an adult family member of a child affected by dermatitis. The items inquire about housework, food preparation, sleep, family leisure activity, shopping, expenditure, tiredness, emotional distress, relationships and the impact of helping with treatment on the primary caregiver’s life. The DFI questions are scored on a four -point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3, so that the total DFI score ranges from 0 to 30.

Faces Pain Scale – Revised The Faces Pain Scale – Revised (FPS -R) is a self -report measure of pain intensity developed for children (Hicks 2001 ). It was adapted from the Faces Pain Scale t o make it possible to score the sensation of pain on the widely accepted 0 to 10 metric. The scale shows a close linear relationship with visual analog pain scales across the age range of 4 to 16 years. It is easy to administer and requires no equipment ex cept for the photocopied faces. The instrument has well established psychometric properties and has been validated in school -going children. The instrument will be used to assess injection site pain at the time points specified in Section 8.1. This instrument measures concept(s), which are known only/best to the person who is administered the injection. As such the instrument is designed for self-report. Where possible the patient should read the instructions and complete the instrument alone. Where required a caregiver (parent or other) can read the instructions aloud to the person with AD. However, it is important that the person with AD’ s selected response is entered directly into the instrument. The caregiver must not influence or question the response given by the person with AD. This should be communicated to caregivers during the first visit.

PROMIS Anxiety and Depression S cale The PROMIS Anxiety instrument measures self -reported fear (fearfulness, panic), anxious misery (worry, dread), hyperarousal (tension, nervousness, restlessness), and somatic symptoms related to arousal (racing heart, dizziness). The PROMIS Depression instrument assesses self-reported negative mood (sadness, guilt), views of self (self -criticism, worthlessness), and social cognition (loneliness, interpersonal alienation), as well as decreased positive affect and engagement (loss of interest, meaning, an d purpose). Both of these assessments need to be completed at the time points specified in Section 8.1. This questionnaire asks the caregiver to re port their perception of the patient’s anxiety and depressive symptoms. It is therefore completed by the caregiver.

Investigator’s Global Assessment The IGA is an assessment instrument used in clinical studies to rate the severity of AD globally, based on a 5 -point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). The IGA score will be assessed at time points accor ding to Section 8.1. The IGA is provided in the study reference manual and in Appendix 2. 8.2.2.10. Eczema Area and Severity Index The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD (Hanifin 2001 ). The EASI is a composite index with scores ranging from 0 to 72. Four AD disease characteristics (erythema, thickness [induration, papulation, edema], scratching [excoriation], and lichenification) will each be assessed for severity by the investigator or designee on a scale of “0” (absent) through “3” (severe). In addition, the area of AD involvement will be assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs, and converted to a score of 0 to 6. In each body region, the area is expressed as 0, 1 (1% to 9%), 2 (10% to 29%), 3 (30% to 49%), 4 (50% to 69%), 5 (70% to 89%), or 6 (90% to 100%). The EASI will be collected at time points according to Section 8.1. NOTE: Each of the body regions (head and neck, trunk, upper limbs, lower limbs) is assigned a proportion of the total body surface area. These proportions vary with age and are different in young children as co mpared to older children. The EASI assessment tool is provided in the study reference manual. 8.2.2.11. Global Individual Signs Score Individual components of the AD lesions (erythema, infiltration/papulation, excoriations, and lichenification) will be rated global ly (ie, each assessed for the whole body, not by anatomical region) on a 4 -point scale (from 0=none to 3=severe) using the EASI severity grading criteria (Section 8.2.2.10 ). The Global Individual Signs Score (GISS) will be assessed at time points according to Section 8.1. The GISS assessment tool is provided in the study reference manual.

SCORing Atopic Dermatitis The SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) is a validated tool used in clinical research and clinical practice that was developed to standardize the evaluation of the extent and severity of AD (European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis 1993 ). There are 3 components to the assessment: A = extent or affected BSA, B = severity, and C = subjective symptoms. The extent of AD is assessed as a percentage of each defined body area (see Section 8.2.2.13 ) and reported as the sum of all areas, with a maximum score of 100% (assigned as “A” in the overall SCORAD calculation) . The severity of 6 specific symptoms of AD (redness, swelling, oozing/crusting, excoriation, skin thickening/lichenification, and dryness) is assessed using the following scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3) (for a maximum of 18 total p oints, assigned as “B” in the overall SCORAD calculation). Subjective assessment of itch and sleeplessness is recorded for each symptom by the patient or relative on a Visual Analogue Scale, where 0 is no itch (or sleeplessness) and 10 is the worst imagin able itch (or sleeplessness), with a maximum possible score of 20. This parameter is assigned as “C” in the overall SCORAD calculation. The SCORAD is calculated as: A/5 + 7B/2 + C where the maximum is 103. Patients will undergo this assessment at time p oints according to Section 8.1. The SCORAD assessment tool is provided in the study reference manual. 8.2.2.13. Body Surface Area Involvement of Atopic Dermatitis Body surface area affected by AD will be assessed for each section of the body using the rule of nines (the possible highest score for each region is: head and neck [9%], anterior trunk [18%], back [18%], upper limbs [18%], lower limbs [36%], an d genitals [1%]) and will be reported as a percentage of all major body sections combined. Patients will undergo this assessment at time points according to Section 8.1. NOTE: The proportion assigned to different body regions is different in younger children as compared to older children (head and neck area is assigned a higher proportion in younger children as compared to older children). The BSA assessment tool is provided in the study reference manual. 8.2.2.14.

Biomarker Procedures Thymus and activation -regula ted chemokine and total serum IgE are markers of type 2/Th2 activity as downstream mediators in the IL -4/IL-13 signaling pathway (Wirnsberger 2006 , Takeda 1997 ). These analytes may be assessed as measures of type 2/Th2 activity and PD effect of dupilumab. The results may be used for modeling dupilumab activity with drug levels in the comparison of dosing regimens. Thymus and activation -regulated chemokine levels have also been closely associated with AD diseas e activity and severity (Beck 2014 ), and will be evaluated as an exploratory marker of efficacy. These markers may also be assessed for their potential value in predicting treatment response. Lactate dehydrogenase levels have also b een shown to correlate with disease severity and activity in patients with AD ( Mukai 1990 ). Serum samples for measurements of biomarkers (including TARC, total IgE, immunoglobulin profiling, and LDH [which will be measured as part o f the blood chemistry]) to study the PD activity of dupilumab in pediatric AD patients will be collected at time points according to Section 8.1.

Adverse Event An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a study drug, which may or may not have a causal relationship with the study drug. Therefore, an AE is any unfavorable and uninten ded sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, which is temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug. An AE also includes any worsening (ie, any clinically significant change in frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition that is temporally associated with the use of the study drug. 9.3.2. Serious Adverse Event An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  Results in death – includes all deaths, even th ose that appear to be completely unrelated to study drug (eg, a car accident in which a patient is a passenger).  Is life-threatening – in the view of the investigator, the patient is at immediate risk of death at the time of the event. This does not includ e an AE that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . In-patient hospitalization is defined as admission to a hospital or an emergency room for longer t han 24 hours. Prolongation of existing hospitalization is defined as a hospital stay that is longer than was originally anticipated for the event, or is prolonged due to the development of a new AE as determined by the investigator or treating physician.  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (substantial disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions).  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  Is an important medical event - Important medical events may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent 1 of the other serious outcomes listed above (eg, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse).

Abnormal Laboratory, Vital Signs, or Electrocardiogram Results The criteria for determining whether an abnormal objective test finding should be reported as an AE include:  the test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, a nd/or  the test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/ surgical intervention, and/or  the test result leads to a change in dosing (outside of protocol -stipulated dose adjustments), discontinuation from the study, significant additional conc omitant drug treatment, or other therapy Contact the medical monitor in the event the investigator feels that an abnormal test finding should be reported as an AE, although it does not meet any of the above criteria. Repeating an abnormal test, in the abse nce of any of the above conditions, does not constitute an AE. Any abnormal test result that is determined to be an error does not require reporting as an AE. Evaluation of severity of laboratory abnormalities will be assessed according to the scale outlin ed in Section 9.5.1 . 9.4.6. Follow -up Adverse event information will be collected until the patient’s last study visit. Serious adverse event information will be collected until the event is considered chronic and/or stable. 9.5. Evaluation of Severity and Causality 9.5.1. Evaluation of Severity The severity of AEs will be graded according to the following scale:  Mild: Does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient ’s normal functioning level. It may be an annoyance. P rescription drugs are not ordinarily needed for relief of symptoms, but may be given because of personality of the patient .  Moderate: Produces some impairment of functioning but is not hazardous to health. It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment. Treatment for symptom may be needed.  Severe: Produces significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation and is a definite hazard to the patient ’s health. Treatment for symptom may be given and/or patient hospitalized. If a laboratory value is considered an AE , its severity should be based on the degree of physiological impairment the value indicates.

Investigator Alert Notification Regeneron (or designee) will inform all investigators participating in this clinical trial, as well as in any other clinical trial using the same investigational drug, of any SAE that meets the relevant requirements for expedited reporting (an AE that is serious, unexpected based on the Investigator’s Brochure, and has a reasonable suspected causal relationship to the medicinal/study drug). 10. STATISTICAL PLAN This section provides the bas is for the statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the study. The SAP may be revised during the study to accommodate amendments to the clinical study protocol and to make changes to adapt to unexpected issues in study execution and data that may affect the planned analyses. The final SAP will be issued before the database is locked. Analysis variables are listed in Section 4. 10.1. Statistical Hypothesis The following null hypothesis and alternative will be tested for each dupilumab treatment group: H0: No treatment difference between dupilumab and placebo H1: There is a treatment difference between dupilumab and placebo Baseline weight group (<30 kg and ≥30 k g) and region (North America/Europe) will be the 2 stratification factors for patient randomization and will be accounted for in the statistical modeling for efficacy. 10.2. Justification of Sample Size Based on the initial sample size of 240 patients (prior to this amendment) , it is estimated that with 80 patients per group, at the 2 -sided 5% significance level, the study will have:  97% power to detect a difference of 23% between dupilumab Q2W treatment and placebo treatment (both in combination with TCS) in the percentage of patients who achieve an IGA score 0 or 1 at week 16, assuming that the percentages are 28% and 5% for dupilumab Q2W and placebo, respectively  87% power to detect a difference of 17% between dupilumab Q4W treatment and placebo treatment (both in combination with TCS) in the percentage of patients who achieve an IGA score 0 or 1 at week 16, assuming that the percentages are 22% and 5% for dupilumab 300 mg Q4W and placebo, respectively  99% power to detect a difference of 51% in the percentages o f patients achieving EASI -75 response at week 16, assuming that the percentages are 68% and 17% for dupilumab Q2W and placebo, respectively, (both in combination with TCS)  99% power to detect a difference of 45% in percentages of patients achieving EASI -75 response at week 16, assuming that the percentages are 62% and 17% for dupilumab Q4W and placebo, respectively, (both in combination with TCS) VV-RIM-00053769-2.0 Approved - 21 Nov 2018 GMT-5:00"
80,page_80,"Clinical Study Protocol R668 -AD-1652 Amendment 3 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc . Page 81 of 109 CONFIDENTIAL The significance level is set to 2 -sided, 0.05 level. The assumptions used for the power calculations were estim ated based on results from the R668 -AD-1224 study (phase 3 combination study for adult AD patients) and R668 -AD-1021 study (a phase 2b dose -ranging study in adults with AD) for patients with IGA=4 at baseline. Based on the result from the R668 -AD-1021 stud y, the efficacy profile for dupilumab 200 mg Q2W is similar to dupilumab 300 mg Q2W. In the absence of data of dupilumab in pediatric patients with AD, the data observed in the adult studies R668 -AD-1224 and R668 -AD-1021 are used for these sample size calculations. This is a conservative assumption as it is expected that the effect of dupilumab in children will be greater than that seen in adults. Children have disease for a shorter duration than adults and the disease is more Th2 driven in acute phase whil e it becomes more type 1 helper T cell in chronic phase (Thepen 1996 , Gittler 2012 ). In addition, children with AD in general respond better to systemic therapies than adults (Schmitt 2007 ). A recent study compared the differences between activated and polarized T -cell subsets in blood of adult and pediatric patients with AD. The study found that AD is Th2 dominated in children while it extends to additional helper T cell subsets, parti cularly Th22, in adults (Czarnowicki 2015 ). The sample size calculations were done using nQuery (7.0). Due to an inadvertent operational error, 68 patients were potentially unblinded. Details about the error and why it may have been unbli nding are not included in the protocol but will be described in the clinical study report. An additional approximately 90 patients will be added to the study to ensure that the original number of blinded patients for all treatment groups is available for sensitivity analyses that exclude the potentially unblinded patients. This will maintain study balance and power. The total sample size of the study will be up to approximately 330 patients (110 patients per group) , and approximately 262 patients (80 , 91 and 91 in Q2W, Q4W, and placebo group, respectively) if excluding the potentially unblinded patients. With the sample size of 330 patients or 262 patients, the power for the co -primary endpoints will be greater than 90%. 10.3. Analysis Sets 10.3.1. Efficacy Analys is Sets The full analysis set (FAS) includes all randomized patients. Efficacy analyses will be based on the treatment allocated at randomization (as randomized). All efficacy variables will be evaluated in the FAS, which will be considered to be the prim ary analysis set . The modified full analysis set (mFAS) includes all randomized patients but excludes potentially unblinded patients. The primary endpoint, co -primary endpoint, and selected secondary endpoints will be evaluated in the mFAS as sensitivity a nalyses . The per protocol set (PPS) includes all patients in the FAS except for those who are excluded because of major protocol violations. A preliminary list of potential major protocol violation s is provided in Appendix 3 and a final list will be generated prior to database lock . The PPS will also exclude potentially unblinded patients. The primary and co -primary endpoint s will also be evaluated in the PPS. VV-RIM-00053769-2.0 Approved - 21 Nov 2018 GMT-5:00"

Dem ography and Baseline Characteristics Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by treatment group. 10.5.2. Efficacy Analyses For each dose regimen and all efficacy variables, the analysis will be comparisons of each of the dupilumab treatment groups with the placebo group (Q2W and Q4W combined). A sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoint and selected secondary endpoints will be performed in the mFAS . 10.5.2.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis The Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test adjusted by randomization strata (baseline weight group and region) will be used for analyzing the percentage of patients with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 or percentage of patients with EASI -75 at week 16. The Mantel -Fleiss (MF) criterion will be checked, and if it is not met, sensitivity analyses including each stratification factor separately in CMH test will be conducted. All efficacy data regardless if the patient is on the study treatment or discontinues the study treatment but remains in the study will be used for ana lysis. Specifically, if a patient stays in the study until the end of the planned placebo -controlled treatment period, all efficacy data collected up to the planned end of treatment visit will be included in the primary analysis regardless if the patient i s on treatment or not. To account for the impact of rescue treatment on the efficacy effect: For the primary efficacy endpoints (which are binary efficacy endpoints), if rescue treatment is used (see Section 7.3), the patient will be specified as a nonresponder from the time the rescue is used. If a patient withdraws from study, this patient will be counted as a nonresponder for endpoints after withdrawal. Sensitivity analysis using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach to determine patient’s status at week 16 will be conducted to assess the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis with regards to handling of missing data. The e fficacy data will be set to missing after rescue treatment is used, then the LOCF method will be used to determine patients’ status at week 16. In addition, the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel method adjusted by randomization strata will also be performed on all observed data regardless if rescue treatment is used. A patient with missing data will be counted as a non -responder. Other sensitivity analyses may be conducted. VV-RIM-00053769-2.0 Approved - 21 Nov 2018 GMT-5:00"

Secondary Efficacy Analysis For binary endpoints, the secondary efficacy analysis will use th e same approach as that used for the primary analysis. For continuous endpoints:  The multiple imputation (MI) with analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model will be used as the primary analysis method. Patients’ efficacy data through week 16 after the rescue treatment use will be set to missing first, and then be imputed by the multiple imputation method. Missing data from the FAS will be imputed 40 times to generate 40 complete datasets by using the SAS procedure MI following the 2 steps below:  Step 1: The m onotone missing pattern is induced by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method in MI procedure using seed number 12345.  Step 2: The missing data at subsequent visits will be imputed using the regression method for the monotone pattern with seed number 54321 and adjustment for covariates including treatment groups, randomization strata (baseline weight group and region), and relevant baseline.  The week 16 data of each of the 40 complete datasets will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment, randomization strata (baseline weight group and region), and relevant baseline included in the model, and the SAS MIANALYZE procedure will be used to generate valid statistical inferences by combining results from the 40 analyses using Rub in’s formula.  If a patient receives rescue treatment, the efficacy data collected after rescue treatment is initiated will be treated as missing. All efficacy data will be used for analysis regardless of whether the patient is on study treatment or discon tinues the study treatment but remains in the study.  In addition to the MI method described above, sensitivity analyses such as ANCOVA model with LOCF, MI method with ANCOVA model on all observed data regardless of rescue use will be conducted. Additional details on sensitivity analyses will be provided in the SAP. Time to event endpoint will be analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Kaplan - Meier curves will also be provided. 10.5.2.3. Multiplicity Considerations A hierarchical procedure will be used to c ontrol the overall Type -1 error rate at 0.05 for the primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints across the 2 dupilumab dose regimens vs placebo. The abbreviated, preliminary plan for hierarchical testing order for the primary endpoint and key secondary e ndpoints is shown in Table 3.

First -Step Analysis A first -step analysis may be performed when the last patient completes 16 weeks of treatment duration, in order to expedite the submission to regulatory agencies. No changes in the conduct of the study will be made based on this first -step analysis. The as sessment of primary and secondary endpoints specified in Section 4.2.1 and Section 4.2.2 performed during the analysis will be the final analysis of the primary endpoint and secondary endpoints. Hence there will be no need for alpha adjustment due to the first -step analysis. If a decision is made to perform the first -step anal ysis, in order to maintain study integrity with respect to the post -treatment follow -up visits, safety visits and analyses, a dissemination plan will be written. This plan will clearly identify the team (including the statistician) that will perform the fi rst-step analysis and all related activities, restrict other clinical team members and other Sponsor personnel from access to individual patient treatment allocation and site level analysis results, and ensure that the dedicated team will not participate i n the data review or data decisions for the following post treatment analyses. However, the dedicated team can participate in the analysis following the final database lock. 10.5.3. Safety Analysis Safety analysis will be based on the SAF. This includes reported TEAEs, AESIs, and other safety information (eg, clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, and 12 -lead ECG results).

A copy of each CRF page is to be retained by the investigator as part of the study record and must be available at all tim es for inspection by authorized representatives of the sponsor and regulatory authorities. Corrections to the electronic CRF will be entered in the electronic CRF by the investigator or an authorized designee. All changes, including date and person perform ing corrections, will be available via the audit trail, which is part of the system. For corrections made via data queries, a reason for any alteration must be provided. 13. AUDITS AND INSPECTIO NS This study may be subject to a quality assurance audit or inspe ction by the sponsor or regulatory authorities. Should this occur, the investigator is responsible for:  Informing the sponsor of a planned inspection by the authorities as soon as notification is received, and authorizing the sponsor’s participation in the inspection  Providing access to all necessary facilities, study data, and documents for the inspection or audit  Communicating any information arising from inspection by the regulatory authorities to the sponsor immediately  Taking all appropriate measures r equested by the sponsor to resolve the problems found during the audit or inspection Documents subject to audit or inspection include but are not limited to all source documents, CRFs, medical records, correspondence, ICFs/IAFs, IRB/EC files, documentation of certification and quality control of supporting laboratories, and records relevant to the study maintained in any supporting pharmacy facilities. Conditions of study material storage are also subject to inspection. In addition, representatives of the s ponsor may observe the conduct of any aspect of the clinical study or its supporting activities both within and outside of the investigator's institution. In all instances, the confidentiality of the data must be respected. 14. ETHICAL AND REGULATO RY CONSIDERA TIONS 14.1. Good Clinical Practice Statement It is the responsibility of both the sponsor and the investigator(s) to ensure that this clinical study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki , and that are consistent with the ICH guidelines for GCP and applicable regulatory requirements.

Informed Consent The principles of informed consent are described in ICH guidelines for GCP. The ICF/IAF used by the investigator must be reviewed and approved by the sponsor prior to submission to the appropriate IRB/EC. A copy of the IRB/EC -approved ICF/IAF and documentation of approval must be provided to the sponsor before study drug will be shipped to the study site. It is the responsibility of the investigator or designee (if acceptable by local regulations) to obtain written informed assent from each patient and written informed consent from each patient’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s) prior to the patient’s participation in the study and after th e aims, methods, objectives, and potential hazards of the study have been explained to fullest possible extent in language that the patient (if applicable) and the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) can understand. The ICF should be signed and dated by the pat ient’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s) and the same investigator or designee who explained the ICF, and the IAF be signed and dated by the patient (if applicable) and the same investigator or designee who explained the IAF. Local law must be observed in dec iding whether 1 or both parents/guardians consent is required. If only 1 parent or guardian signs the consent form, the investigator must document the reason the other parent or guardian did not sign. The patient may also be required to sign and date the ICF or a separate IAF, as determined by the IRB/EC and in accordance with the local regulations and requirements.  Patient s/parents or legal guardians who can write but cannot read will have the assent/consent form read to them before writing their name on t he form.  Patient s/parents or legal guardians who can understand but who can neither write nor read will have the ICF read to them in presence of an impartial witness, who will sign and date the IAF/ICF to confirm that informed consent was given. The origin al IAF/ICF must be retained by the investigator as part of the patient 's study record, and a copy of the signed IAF/ICF must be given to the patient/patient’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s). If new safety information results in significant changes in the r isk/benefit assessment, the ICF/IAF must be reviewed and updated appropriately. All study patient s and their parent(s) or legal guardian(s) must be informed of the new information and provide their written assent (if applicable) or consent if they wish the patient to continue in the study. The original signed revised ICF/IAF must be maintained in the patient’s study record and a copy must be given to the patient/patient’s parent(s) or legal guardian(s). 14.3. Patient Confidentiality and Data Protection The investigator must take all appropriate measures to ensure that the anonymity of each study patient will be maintained. Patient s should be identified by their initials and a patient identification number, only, on CRFs or other documents submitted to the sponsor. Documents that will not be submitted to the sponsor (eg, signed ICF/IAF) must be kept in strict confidence. VV-RIM-00053769-2.0 Approved - 21 Nov 2018 GMT-5:00"

The sponsor shall take all appropriate measures to safeguard and prevent acce ss to this data by any unauthorized third party. 14.4. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee An appropriately constituted IRB/EC, as described in ICH guidelines for GCP, must review and approve:  The protocol, ICF/IAF, and any other materials to be provided to the patient s (eg, advertising) before any patient may be enrolled in the study  Any amendment or modification to the study protocol or ICF/IAF before implementation, unless the change is necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to the patient s, in whi ch case the IRB/EC should be informed as soon as possible  Ongoing studies on an annual basis or at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk In addition, the IRB/EC should be informed of any event likely to affect the safety of patient s or the continue d conduct of the clinical study. A copy of the IRB/EC approval letter with a current list of the IRB/EC members and their functions must be received by the sponsor prior to shipment of drug supplies to the investigator. The approval letter should include t he study number and title, the documents reviewed, and the date of the review. Records of the IRB/EC review and approval of all study documents (including approval of ongoing studies) must be kept on file by the investigator. 15. PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS The sponso r may not implement a change in the design or operation of the protocol or ICF/IAF without an IRB/EC -approved amendment. Regulatory approvals will also be obtained where required by local legislation. 16. PREMATURE TERMINATIO N OF THE STUDY OR CLOSE -OUT OF A SI TE 16.1. Premature Termination of the Study The sponsor has the right to terminate the study prematurely. Reasons may include efficacy, safety, or futility, among others.

Highly effective contraceptive measures include stable use of combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, vaginal, transdermal) or progestogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, injectable, implantable) associated with inh ibition of ovulation initiated 2 or more menstrual cycles prior to screening; intrauterine device (IUD); intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS); bilateral tubal ligation; vasectomized partner; and or sexual abstinence**. * For the purpose of this stud y, any female who has had her first menstrual period (menarche) and is sexually active will be considered to be of childbearing potential. Female patients who are not of childbearing potential at the start of the study but have the onset of menarche during the course of the study and are sexually active will also have to follow adequate birth control methods to continue participation in the study. ** Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual i ntercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study treatments. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. NOTE: Peri odic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of a study, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
