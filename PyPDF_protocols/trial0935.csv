Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 5of 98Study Methodology This is an interventional, multi-national, multi -site, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase IIIb study designed to demonstrate efficacy and safety of eptinezumab for migraine prevention in patients with unsuccessful prior preventive treatments. The placebo -controlled period will be followed by an extension period where all patients will receive active treatment to assess the long -term safety , tolerability and effect of eptinezumab. The total study duration from the Screening Visit to the Completion Visit is approximatel y 76weeks and includes a Screening Period (28-30 days), Placebo -controlled Period (24 weeks) and Extension Period (48weeks). The target population for this study is defined as patients with chronic migraine (CM) or episodic migraine (EM), as outlined in the IHS ICHD -3 guidelines ,1and with documented evidence of failure to 2 -4 different preventive migraine medications in the past 10 years. The aim i s that approximately 40% of the randomi zed patients are patients with EM. 840 patients will be randomly allocated via a randomization system to one of three treatment groups : eptinezumab 300 mg, eptinezumab 100 mg, or placebo, ina ratio of 1:1:1. Randomization will be stratified by monthly headache days (MHDs) at baseline (14MHDs/ 14MHDs) and by country . The patient will receive IMP starting from the Baseline Visit to f ollow a Q12W dosing schedule (every 12weeks) with either eptinezumab or placebo by IV infusion over 30 minutes (+15 minutes). At Visit 8patients will enter the Extension Period. Patients who were assigned to placebo in the Placebo - controlled Period will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups : eptinezumab 300 mgor eptinezumab 100 mg with a ratio of 1:1. Patients assigned to eptinezumab 300 mg or ept inezumab 100 mg in the Placebo -controlled Period will continue on their original assignments . Patients will complete a daily headache eDiary from the time of screening until the Completion/Withdrawal Visit. During infusion visits, assessments of safety will be performed before and after each infusion. At these visits, AEs will be collected as well as safety laboratory tests, ECG, weight, and vital signs. Patient -reported outcomes (PROs) must be administered prior to infusion. Patients who complete the study will attend a Completion Visit which will include a Safety Follow -up evaluation at 12 weeks after their last dose of IMP. Patients who withdraw, except for those who withdraw their consent, will be asked to attend a Withdra wal Visit 12 weeks after their last dose of IMP and undergo Safety Follow -Up evaluations. Patients who withdraw prior to the Week 24 Visit will additionally undergo Efficacy Follow -Up evaluations. An independent Safety Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will regularly monitor the patients' safety data according to the DMC Charter . In general, no information about individual treatment codes will be available to investigators, patients or site - facing CRO personnel until after all patients have completed the stud y. The results of the Placebo- controlled Period will be reported when ended for all patients. All data from the Placebo -controlled Period will be cleaned and the database for the Placebo -controlled Period will be locked. Data will be unblinded for the reporting team (Sponsor), and all analyses specified in the SAP for data collected in the Placebo -controlled Period will be performed and included in the Clinical Study Report (CSR). After all patients have completed the study, an addendum to the CSR, includin g the results from the Extension Period, will be produced. Investigators and patients will be informed about which treatment (active or placebo) their patients received in the Placebo -controlled Period and the actual dose of eptinezumab received in the Ext ension period only after the last patient has completed the study. Assessments performed in a subset of patients: Exit interviews will be performed shortly (no later than 2 weeks) after the last assessment of the Week 24 Visit or Withdrawal Visit (for pa tients who withdraw prior to Week 24) on a subset of patients (hereafter referred to as the ‘ Exit Interview subset ’)after all visit assessments are completed . The aim is to complete exit interviews for 100 patients out of the first 345 randomized patients. The study design is presented in Panel 1and the scheduled study procedures and assessments are summarized in Panel 2."

Assessment Details The assessments are summarized in Panel 2. Details for selected assessments which are non -standard/require more explanation/description are provided below. All scales used to assess efficacy and pharmacoeconomic information in this study, are patient -reported instruments . eDiary Patients will complete a daily headache eDiary from the t ime of screening until the Completion/Withdrawal Visit consisting of applications and reports which will be used to derive the migraine and headache endpoints. The eDiary will be distributed to each subject at the Screening Visit after subject training on eDiary use by site staff. The eDiary data from the 28 days following the Screening Visit will be used to determine eligibility criteria ,baseline migraine and headache values and eDiary compliance . At the relevant study visits, compliance data from the eDiary will be reviewed at the study site. Headache Impact Test (HIT -6) The HIT -6 (v1.0) is a Likert -type, self -reporting questionnaire designed to assess the impact of an occurring headache and its effect on the ability to function normally in daily life. The HIT -6 contains 6 questions, each item rated from “never” to “always” with the following response scores: never = 6, rarely = 8, sometimes = 10, very often = 11, and always = 13. The total score for the HIT -6 is the sum of each response score and ranges from 36 to 78. The life impact derived from the total score is described as followed: Severe ( ≥60), Substantial (56-59), Some (50 -55), Little to None ( ≤49). It takes less than 5 minutes to complet e the HIT -6 questionnaire."
7,page_7,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 8of 98Assessment Details (continued) Most Bothersome Symptom The Investigator will verbally obtain the most bothersome symptom associated with the patient’s migraines during the Baseline Visit. Patients will be asked to rate the improvement in this symptom from baseline on a 7 - point scale identical to the scale used for the PGIC. The MBS areas include: nausea, vomiting, s ensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound , mental cloudiness, fatigue, pain with activity, mood changes, other . It takes less than 5 minutes to complete the MBS. Migraine -Specific Quality -of-Life Questionnaire (MSQ v2.1) The MSQ v2.1 is a patient -reported outcome designed to assess the quality of life in patients with migraine. It consists of 14 items covering three domains: role function restrictive; role function preventive; and emotional function. Each item is scored on a 6-point scale ranging from 1 (n one of the time) to 6 (all of the time). Scores are obtained for each domain and ranges from 0-100. Higher scores indicate better quality of life. It takes approximately 5-10 minutes to complete the MSQ v2.1. Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU) Migraine -specific healthcare resource utilization information will be collected in terms of outpatient health care professional visits, emergency room visits, hospital admissions, as well as duration of hospital stays. Clinical site personnel and patients will be instructed to capture utilization that takes place outside of visits associated with their participation in the clinical trial. Exit interview (applies to Exit Interview subset) Exit interviews will be conducted on patients ,tailored to the target population and this trial to help better understand experiences with disease , gain additional insight into trial data, support interpretation of quantitative assessments and endpoints to discuss meaningfulness of change . Statistical Methodology The following analysis sets will be used to analyse and present the data: all-patients -randomized set (APRS) -all randomized patients all-patients -treated (APTS) -all patients in the APRS who received at least one infusion of dou ble-blind IMP full-analysis set (FAS) -all patients in the APTS who had a valid baseline assessment and at least one post - baseline 4 -week assessment of MMDs in Weeks 1 -12 all-patients -treated long -term set (APTS_LT) -all patients in the APRS who received at least one i nfusion of IMP and had a visit inthe Extension Period full-analysis long -term set (FAS_LT) -all patients in the APTS_LT who had a valid baseline assessment and a valid assessment of monthly migraine days in the Extension Period The patients and data will be classified into the analysis set saccording to these definitions at separate Classification Meetings . For the reporting of the Placebo -controlled Period , the Classification meeting will be held after the data base release for the reporting of the Placebo -controlled Period but before the blind has been broken and will concern the classification into APTS and FAS . For the addendum to CSR, the Classification meeting will be held after the data base release for the reporting of the Extension Period and will concern the classification into APTS_LT and FAS_LT. If not otherwise stated, tables, figures and listings ( TFLs )in the Placebo -controlled Period will be summarized by randomized treatmen t group and TFLs in the Extension Period will be summarized by treatment group in the extension (eptinezumab 300 mg or 100 mg). Efficacy analyses of the Placebo -controlled Period will be based on FAS, and efficacy analyses in the Extension Period will be based on FAS_LT. Demographics andBaseline characteristics will be based on FAS , and safety tables (including exposure and medications) will be based on APTS in the Placebo -controlled Period ,and on FAS_LT and APTS _LT respectively in the Extension Period . Unless otherwise specified, all testing will be done two - sided, based on a 5% significance level."
8,page_8,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 9of 98Statistical Methodology (continued) Primary analysis of the primary endpoint: The number of monthly migraine days ( MMD s)Week 1-12 summarises diary data across Weeks 1 to 12 . Details on derivation and imputations of days with missing or incomplete eDiary data will be described in theSAP . Changes from baseline in MMDs at the 6 first 4-week intervals will be analysed using a res tricted maximum likelihood (REML)-based mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach. The analysis will be performed using all available monthly change scores for the first 6 months in the study. The model will include the following fixed effects: mon th (Weeks 1 -4, Weeks 5 -8, Weeks 9 -12, Weeks 13 -16, Weeks 17-20, and Weeks 21 - 24), country, stratification factor (MHDs at baseline: ≤14/>14) and treatment as factors, baseline MMDs as a continuous covariate, treatment -by-month interaction, baseline score -by-month interaction, and stratum -by-month interaction. An unstructured variance structure will be used to model the within -patient errors. The mean differences between each dose of eptinezumab and placebo will be estimated based on the least squares means for the treatment -by-visit interaction in the MMRM model. The primary comparisons will be the contrasts between each dose of eptinezumab and placebo averaged across Weeks 1 -12. Analysis of the key secondary endpoints: For the key secondary endpoint s based on response rates , treatment effects compared to placebo will be analyzed using logistic regression. The model will include baseline MMDs as a continuous covariate, and treatment and stratification (MHDs at baseline: ≤14 />14) as factors. The change from baseline in HIT -6score for the Placebo -controlled Period will be analysed using a mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) including baseline HIT score as covariate, treatment, country, stratification factor (MHDs at baseline: ≤14 />14 ), and week as fixed fa ctors. In addition, the model will include treatment -by-week interaction , baseline HIT -6score -by-week interaction, and stratum -by-week interaction . An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -patient errors. The Kenward- Roger approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom . Treatment effects will be calculated based on least squares means forthe treatment -by-week interaction estimated at Week 12. Change from baseline in the number of MMDs (W eeks 13-24), will be analysed using the same MMRM methodology as for the primary endpoint. The comparisons will be the contrasts between each dose of eptinezumab and placebo averaged across Weeks 13 -24. Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint: The imp act of missing data in the derivation of the primary endpoint (days with missing or incomplete information in the eDiary) will be evaluated by applying different methods of imputation . Sensitivity analyses of the key secondary endpoints: endpoints where d ata imputation is used ,the impact of the imputation swill be assessed in sensitivity analys es, applying different methods of imputation. Secondary endpoints: Analyses of continuous data based on diary data will use a similar model to the primary analysis , and continuous scale endpoints will be analysed by the same MMRM methodology as for HIT-6. Response variables will use similar analyses as the key secondary response endpoints. The endpoints; patients with a migraine on the day after first dosing and 100% responders for MMDs and MHDs (Weeks 1 -12) will be analysed using an extended Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test, adjusting for the stratification factor (MHDs at baseline: ≤14 />14). Testing Strategy The testing strategy will be a sequence of tests, either testing one endpoint at a time or using Bonferroni -Holm to test a group of endpoints. Only if one step has shown a statistically significant effect will the formal testing continue with the next step, thus ensuring protection of the type 1 error. A significance level of 0.05 will be used. The significance level is denoted by α below. Step1 Test the primary endpoint change from baseline in MMDs (Weeks 1 -12) for the 300 mg dose compared to placebo on a significance level of α. Only if the p -value <α in favour of the 300 mg dose is the effect considered statistically significant and the testing continues with the next step."
9,page_9,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 10of 98Testing Strategy (continued) Step 2 Test the key secondary endpoint 50% responders for MMD (Weeks 1 -12) for the 300 mg d ose compared to placebo, using a significance level of α. Only if the p -value <α in favour of the 300 mg dose is the effect considered statistically significant and the testing continues with the next step. Step 3 Test the primary endpoint change from base line in MMDs (Weeks 1 -12) for the 100 mg dose compared to placebo on a significance level of α. Only if the p -value <α in favour of the 100 mg dose is the effect considered statistically significant and the testing continues with the next step. Step 4 Test the key secondary endpoint 50% responders for MMD (Weeks 1 -12) for the 100 mg dose compared to placebo, using a significance level of α. Only if the p -value <α in favour of the 100 mg dose is the effect considered statistically significant and the tes ting continues with the next step. Step 5 Uses Bonferroni -Holm to test the 3 key secondary endpoints: Change from baseline in MMDs (Weeks 13 -24), 75% responders for MMD (Weeks 1 -12), Change from baseline to Week 12 in HIT -6. All comparisons are of the 300 mg dose compared to placebo. If the smallest of the 3 p -values is <α /3 in favour of the 300 mg dose then the effect seen on this endpoint is considered statistically significant, and the testing continues. Next, if the second smallest p -value is <α/2 in favour of the 300 mg dose, then the effect seen on this endpoint is considered statistically significant, and the testing continues. If the largest p -value is <α in favour of the 300 mg dose then the effect seen on this endpoint is considered statistica lly significant, and the testing continues. Step 6 Uses Bonferroni -Holm to test the 3 key secondary endpoints: Change from baseline in MMDs (Weeks 13 -24), 75% responders for MMD (Weeks 1 -12), Change from baseline to Week 12 in HIT -6. All comparisons are of the 100 mg dose compared to placebo. If the smallest of the 3 p -values is <α /3 in favour of the 100 mg dose , then the effect seen on this endpoint is considered statistically significant, and the testing continues. Next, if the second smallest p -value is <α/2 in favour of the 100 mg dose, then the effect seen on this endpoint is considered statistically significant, and the testing continues. If the largest p -value is <α in favour of the 100 mg dose then , the effect seen on this endpoint is considered sta tistically significant. Sample Size Considerations The two prior eptinezumab Phase III studies, PROMISE -1performed in an EM population andPROMISE -2 performed in a CM population, had the following effect sizes for the primary endpoint when compared to pl acebo (standard deviations): •EM: 100 mg 0.69 (3.1), 300 mg: 1.11 (3.1) •CM: 100 mg 2.03 (5.8), 300 mg 2.60 (5.8) Thepower was determined by simulating the testing strategy (10000 simulations) assuming normal distributions with similar mean and SD for continuous endpoints and similar success rates as the response variables in the Phase III studies for the corresponding population (EM or CM) without assuming the variables to be correlated. With 280 patients per treatment group, assuming that 40% of the patients will be from the EM population and 60% from the CM population, and that 2% of the patients do not have a post -baseline assessment of the primary endpoint , simulations show that the power for the test of the primary endpoint is approximately 94% for the comparison of 100 mg to placebo and 99% power for the comparison of 300 mg to placebo. The individual key secondary endpoints had a power of at least 68% for showing an effect, with a combined power of 58% for seeing an effect for all primary and key secondary endpoints and both doses in the testing strategy."

Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 30of 981Introduction Background Overview Migraine is a disabling disorder characterised by headache and often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and phonophobia.1Attacks of migraine typically last between 4 and 72hours, produce significant disability, and recur often without warning, over decades of time. Migraine is more common in women and most prevalent through the 3rd and 4th decades of life, amplifying its impact on family and career development.2Migraine is one of the most prevalent neurological disease for which medical treatment is sought, and worldwide, is considered the leading cause of disability for people under the age of 50 and 2nd leading cause of disability worldwide.3,4Generally, migraine begins as an episodic disease. Between attacks of migraine, the nervous system returns to a normal (premorbid) state of function. However, approximately 2.5% of people with episodic migraine will annually transform from episodic to chronic migraine, meaning they are experiencing migraine on greater than 15 days per month for at least 3 consecutive months.5,6,7 Currently pharmacological treatments of migraine include acute treatments and preventive medications. Preventive treatments are used on a sustained basis for periods of months to years to prevent migraine from occurring . Preventive drug treatment may be ap propriate in a number of instances, including where frequency of attacks per month is two or higher, or where a patient’s quality of life is severely impaired.8Conventional preventive medications belong to different pharmacological categories ( for exampl e, beta blockers, anticonvulsants) and were all initially developed for other conditions . These treatments show little efficacy and often poor tolerability in patients with migraine, resulting in frequent early discontinuation of treatment.2,9,10,11,12,13,14Thus, there is a substantial proportion of patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, existing treatments and there is a need for preventive medications which are more effective and better tolerated than the current standard of care.15 Calcitonin gene -related peptide ( CGRP )is thought to play an i mportant role in migraine by facilitating the transmission of migraine pain, thereby contributing to the induction of the pronociceptive stage through modulation of the central nervous system (CNS).16,17Studies in animals and humans indicate that the trig eminal ganglion and the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) are likely to be sites of action of CGRP in migraine. In addition, CGRP is expressed in many locations within the CNS, including regions that may be relevant to migraine pain.18,19 During migraine a ttacks, there is an increase in the plasma levels of CGRP in the external jugular vein .20In addition, IV infusion of CGRP has caused migraine and headache in patients with migraine, suggesting that the increase in CGRP observed during spontaneous migraine attacks plays a causative role.21CGRP dilates intracranial and extracranial blood vessels, and regulates mast cell degranulation, that during migraine, leads to the secretion of vasoactive, proinflammatory, and neurosensitizing mediat ors, thereby contributing to migraine pathogenesis .22,23"
30,page_30,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 31of 98A large body of evidence has established the CGRP pathway as a potential target for the treatment of migraine . Studies with monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP or the CGRP receptor have shown that i nhibition of CGRP is efficacious in the treatment of CM and EM .24 Further recent trials with these agents have shown good efficacy and tolerability in patients who experienced previous failure of 2 to 4 different pharmacological migraine preventive medicat ions.25,26 Eptinezumab (LuAG09221) is a humanised monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of CGRP . It is in development by H. Lundbeck A/S for the preventive treatment of migraine . Results from two pivotal, placebo- controlled, Phase III trials showed that eptinezumab led to significant reductions in monthly migraine days in patients with episodic or chronic migraine (ALD403 -CLIN -006 and ALD403- CLIN -011).27,28Unique to eptinezumab ’s profile is that it is administered as an intravenous infusion a nd throughout its Phase IIand Phase III development programs, it has consistently demonstrated preventive efficacy as soon as the first day following infusion and has potential for a sustained benefit over the 12 -week dosing cycle . Eptinezumab is current ly being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an indication in migraine prevention. The following sections provide a brief overview of the nonclinical and clinical data currently available for eptinezumab .Refer to the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure29for more detailed information. Nonclinical Data Several primary pharmacodynamic animal studies (rats, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys) have demonstrate dthe ability of eptinezumab to block CGRP -driven neurogenic dermal vasodilation30in a generally dose dependent manner with doses of eptinezumab as low a s 0.1mg/kg. Furthermore, intravenous administration of eptinezumab, either as a single -or multiple -dose for 1 -month duration up to 100 mg/kg/dose in rats or monkeys, or multiple- dose for 6 -months duration up to 150 mg/kg/dose in monkeys, was well tolera ted. In these studies, eptinezumab induced no functional effects upon the CNS or renal system in rats or monkeys, or upon the cardiovascular or respiratory (excluding the 6 -month study) systems in monkeys. Eptinezumab is not expected to interact directly w ith deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or other chromosomal materials, and genotoxicity assessments have notbeen performed. The carcinogenic potential for eptinezumab has not been thoroughly investigated based upon an extensive evaluation of the literature relat ed to inhibition of CGRP, angiogenesis, and tumor growth, as well as the absence of eptinezumab -related proliferative findings in long term studies in cynomolgus monkeys or clinical trials . Eptinezumab is being developed for the prophylaxis of migraine, an d a significant proportion of migraineurs are women of childbearing potential.31Given the patient population, and in conformance with applicable guidance documents, a complete package of reproductive/development toxicity studies was conducted. In these studies, administration of"
31,page_31,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 32of 98eptinezumab by intravenous injection to pregnant female rats or rabbits at 75 or 150mg/kg/dose was well tolerated and there were no maternal effects or evidence of embryofetal mortality (embryolethality), alterations in growth (fetotoxicity) or structural abnormalities (teratogenicity) for either species. Thelocal tolerance of eptinezumab was assessed following multiple dose studies in rats and cynomolgus monkeys utilizing eptinezumab administered IV . No gross observations including erythema and edema, or toxicologically significant histological changes at th e injection site(s) were noted in either species for any dose route at concentrations up to 100mg/mL eptinezumab . Clinical Data The clinical program of eptinezumab is composed of 5 completed studies to date ; 4 studies are placebo -controlled (Phase Ib stud y in frequent EM ( ALD403 -CLIN -002),32Phase II study in CM ( ALD403 -CLIN -005),33PIII study in frequent EM ( ALD403 -CLIN -006),27PIII study in CM ( ALD4 03-CLIN -011)28and 1 study is open -label (PIII study in CM ( ALD403 -CLIN - 013)).34,35Another study (ALD403 -CLIN -015)36is ongoing to assess treatment of eptinezumab in patients e xperiencing an acute attack of migraine . Results from the two pivotal, placebo -controlled, Phase III trials showed that eptinezumab at doses of 100 mg or 300 mg administered by IV infusion every 12 weeks (2 infusions) led to significant reductions in monthly migraine days in patients with episodic or chronic migraine (ALD403 -CLIN -006 and ALD403- CLIN -011).27Both e ptinezumab 300 mg and 100 mg groups achieved the primary efficacy endpoint and all key secondary endpoints in the prespecified statistical hierarchy. The therapeutic benefit resulting from administration of eptinezumab for the preventive treatment of migraine in adults is robust and clinically meaningful, as demonstrated by the results of the 75% and 50% migraine responder analyses. Administration of eptinezumab 100 or 300 mg result edin a rapid, migraine preventive effect that wasestablished on the day after the first infusion and maintained over the 12 -week dosing cycle. Both eptinezumab doses were associated with a consistent pattern of statistically significant and clinically mean ingful efficacy across these endpoints compared with placebo. Eptinezumab is currently being reviewed by the FDA for an indication in migraine prevention. In the completed eptinezumab clinical studies, the most common adverse reaction in ≥2% of treated pat ients and ≥2% of placebo patients were nasopharyngitis. The majority of these adverse events were categorized as mild to moderate. The safety of eptinezumab has been evaluated in 2,076 patients with migraine who received at least one dose of eptinezumab, representing 1615 patient -years of exposure. Long term data with eptinezumab is limited; however, 128 subjects have been treated with up to 2 years of exposure and no new significant findings have been identified during the long -term follow -up. The safety f indings to date indicate that eptinezumab iswell tolerated and demonstrates a favorable risk -benefit profile based on review of nonclinical, clinical, and scientific literature data."
32,page_32,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 33of 98 Rationale for the Study There is a substantial proportion of patients who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, existing treatments and there is a need for preventive medications which are more effective and better tolerated than the current standard of care.15 The demonstrated efficacy and tolerability profile of eptinezumab supports its use as a potential therapeutic candidate for patients who failed prior preventive treatment for CM and EM. Unique to eptinezumab ’s profile is that it is administered as an intravenous infusion and, throughout its Phase II and Phase III develop ment programs, it has consistently demonstrated preventive efficacy as soon as the first day following infusion and has potential for a sustained benefit over the 12 -week dosing cycle. Thus the current study will evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of eptinezumab in this target population and provide evidence -based treatment guidance for these patients with difficult -to- treat migraine. The onset of the preventive effect will be explored specifically with early timepoints. Additionally, endpoints evaluat ing health- related quality of life, including most bothersome symptoms, as well as work productivity, are included in the study to demonstrate the impact of preventive treatment beyond the reduction in pain and migraine days. The preventive effect will be studied over a treatment duration of 24 weeks and the extension period will allow further investigation of the long- term safety and efficacy profile of eptinezumab. 2Objectives and Endpoints The study objectives and endpoints are summarized in Panel 3.

The Placebo - controlled Period will be followed by an Extension Period where all patients will receive active treatment to assess the long -term safety, tolerability and effect of eptinezumab. This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice ,38and applicable regulatory requirements. An overview of the study is presented in Panel 1. 840 patients, recruited from specialist settings are planned for randomization: 280 patients in the eptinezumab 300 mg group, 280 patients in the eptinezumab 100 mg group and 280patients in the placebo group. The target population for this study is defined as patients diagnosed with chronic migraine (CM) or episodic migraine (EM) , as outlined in the IHS ICHD -3 guidelines,1and with documented evidence of failure to 2 -4 different preventive migraine medications in the past"
36,page_36,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 37of 9810 years (see section 9.1.1 ). The aim is that approximately 40% of the randomized patients are patients with EM. Patients will be randomly allocated via a randomization system to one of three tr eatment groups: eptinezumab 300 mg, eptinezumab 100 mg, or placebo, in a ratio of 1:1:1. Randomization will be stratified by mont hly headache days (MHDs) at baseline (14MHDs/ 14MHDs )and by country . The total study duration from the Screening Visit to the Completion Visit is approximately 76 weeks and includes a Screening Period (28- 30 days), Placebo -controlled Period (24 weeks) and Extension Period (48 weeks). The patient will receive IMP starting from the Baseline Visit to follow a Q12W dosing schedule (every 12 weeks) with either eptinezumab or placebo by IV infusion over 30 minutes (+15 minutes). At Visit 8patients will enter the Extension Period. Patients who were assigned to placebo in the Placebo -controlled Period will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups: eptinezumab 300 mg or eptinezumab 100 mg with a ratio of 1:1. Patients assigned to eptinezumab 300 mg or eptinezumab 100 mg in the Placebo- controlled Period will continue on their original assignments. Patients will be assigned a headache eDiary at the Screening Visit and will be required to complete this daily from the time of screening until the Completion/Withdrawal Visit . During infusion visits, assessments of safety will be performed before and after each infusion. At these visits, AEs will be collected as well as safety laboratory tests, ECG, weight, and vital signs. Patient -reported outcomes (PROs) must be complet ed prior to infusion. Patients who complete the study will attend a Completion Visit which will include a Safety Follow -up evaluation at 12 weeks after their last dose of IMP. Patients who withdraw, except for those who withdraw their consent, will be asked to attend a Withdrawal Visit 12 weeks after their last dose of IMP which will include Safety Follow -Up evaluations. Patients who withdraw prior to the Week 24 Visit will additionally undergo Efficacy Follow -Up evaluations. Patients in the study will have access to appropriate medical care in accordance with normal clinical practice after they complete or withdraw from the study. An independent Safety Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will regularly monitor the patients' safety data according to the DMC Charter . In general, no information about individual treatment codes will be available to investigators patients or site-facing CRO personnel (blinded team) until after the last patient has completed the study . The results of the Placebo- controlled Period will be reported on when ended for all patients. All data from the Placebo- controlled Period will be cleaned and the database for the Placebo- controlled Period will be locked. Data will be unblinded for the reporting team (Sponsor) and"
37,page_37,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 38of 98all analyses specified in the SAP for data collected in the Placebo -controlled Period will be performed and included in the Clinical Study Report (CSR). After all patients have completed the study, an addendum to the CSR, including the results from the Extension Period, will be produ ced. Investigators and patients will be informed about which treatment (active or placebo) their patients received in the Placebo- controlled Period and the actual dose of eptinezumab received in the Extension period only after the last patient has complet ed the study. Assessments performed in a s ubset of patients: Exit interviews will be performed shortly ( no later than 2 weeks )after the last assessment of the Week 24 Visit or Withdrawal Visit (for patients who withdraw prior to Week 24) on a subset of patients (hereafter referred to as the ‘ Exit Interview subset ’) after all visit assessments are completed. The aim is to complete exit interviews for 100 patients out of the first 345 randomized patients. Rationale for the Study Design The current study includes a 24-week double -blind, randomized placebo -controlled period to investigate whether eptinezumab can lead to clinically significant improvement in patients with unsuccessful prior preventive treatments. T he primary endpoint is the change in the number of monthly migraine days andwill be evaluated at Week 12as this is expected (on the basis of P hase III data) to be an adequate duration to investigate the efficacy of eptinezumab. Additional ly, endpoints will be evaluated at Week 24 toinvestigate if the relative efficacy is sustained in this difficult- to-treat population . The extended period beyond Week 12 will also allow adequate time to investigate a beneficial effect on quality of life and on potential reduction in new migraine attacks, after a reduction in the number of monthly migraine days is observed. A 48- week dose-blinded E xtension Period with eptinezumab treatment is included to enable further investigat ionon the long -term safety and efficacy and for further insights into the effectiveness profile of eptinezumab. Endpoints evaluating health -related quality of life, including most bothersome symptoms, as well as work productivity, are included in the study to demonstrate the impact of preventive treatment beyond the reduction in pain and migraine days . The study population is selected on the basis that there is a substantial proportion of p atient s who do not respond to, or cannot tolerate, existing treatments and there is a need for preventive medications which are more effective and better tolerated than the current standard of care.15Thus the study will include patients with EMor CMin whom 2 to 4 migraine preventive medications of different pharmacological class were previously unsuccessful. The proposed study population are patient swith EM (migraine occurring on ≥4 days and headache occurring on <14 days) or CM(migraine occurring on ≥8 days and headache occurring on >14 days ),which reflect the commonly used definition sof EM and CM patients . This target population cor responds to the patient populations in the completed phase III studiesin EM (ALD403- CLIN -006) and CM (ALD403 -CLIN -011)27,28and in which eptinezumab demonstrated efficacy and consequently justifies the patient population f or this"
38,page_38,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 39of 98study. Fulfilment of criteria for EMor CM, according to the eligibility criteria in this protocol, will be confirmed via prospectively collected information in the eDiary during the Screening Period . Amongst patients with CM ,there is a proportion of patients with concurrent Medication Overuse Headache (MoH ).39,40These patients are allowed to be included in the study . During the study, the patients will be asked about occurrence of aura in the eDiary. To minimize patient burden during the study for migraine with aura, the patient's usual aura will only be described and diagnosed at the S creening Visit. Subsequently, the patient will be asked about occurrence of aura in the eDiary based on a question in the eDiary; “Have you experienced aura with this headache?” Patients will be asked in the eDiary to fill in if they took any medications to treat a headache and if so, if the y took this medication because they believed this was a migraine . As several medic ations are used both to treat non -migraine - headache and migraine, the classification of a migraine -specific medication is not feasible by registering the product used alone. Furthermore, the intention is to avoid that, for example, a mild tension -type head ache thatwas treated with paracetamol is counted as a migraine day. The placebo group is representative of the best supportive care (BSC) as the study allows acute treatment of migraine when prior preventive treatments have not worked. Thus, the study wil l compare the efficacy of eptinezumab and BSC versus BSC alone. Doses of 100 and 300 mg eptinezumab administered by IV infusion every 12 weeks have shown to be efficacious and to generally be well tolerated in the treatment of EMand CMin the Phase III s tudies. Thus, these doses and dosing interval are recommended for the target population in this study. The sample size of 840 patients for the primary endpoint is based on the Phase III data ,on the expected change from baseline to Week 12 in the number of monthly migraine days and should provide adequate power for detection of a clinically meaningful treatment effect. Blood sampling will be required at several time points during the study to evaluate standard safety laboratory parameters, ADA including NAbs. 4Ethics Ethical Rationale This study will evaluate eptinezumab as a potential therapeutic candidate for a target patient population who failed prior preventive treatment for CM and EM. Inclusion of a placebo group is justified since the group is representative of the BSC allowing acute treatment of migraine when prior preventive treatments have not worked. Thus, nopatient will be denied access to standard treatments. The randomization rati o of 1:1:1 increases the possibility that the patient will receive an active treatment and ensures that the majority of patients will receive eptinezumab in the"
39,page_39,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 40of 98Placebo- controlled Period . Furthermore, all patients will receive eptinezumab in the Extension Period. Thus, no patient will be denied access to active treatment with eptinezumab. Two dose groups (100 mg or 300 mg) are considered for the current study as these have shown to be efficacious and to generally be well tolerated in the treatment of episod ic and chronic migraine in the Phase III studies and will help guide the dose selection for this target difficult- to-treat population. The patients will be fully informed about the study, including the risks and benefits of their participation in the study . The patient may withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, specified or unspecified and without penalty or loss of benefits to which the patient is otherwise entitled. Unscheduled visits can be made ,and immediate withdrawal is possible. Throughout the study, signs of suicidal risk will be assessed and the patients at risk will be withdrawn from the study. In general, safety data with eptinezumab have not raised any clinical safety concerns at doses of 100 and 300 mg from the Phase III studies, supporting that eptinezumab can be safely used in the current study in patients with difficult- to-treat migraine. However, it cannot be ruled out that the IMP could have adverse effects that have not yet been reported. Based on data from the nonclinical an d clinical studies, and in combination with the cautionary measures implemented in the study design, the risks for the patients are considered well controlled and balanced with the potential benefits of the treatment. In accordance with Good Clinical Pract ice,38qualified medical personnel at Lundbeck or the Clinical CRO will be readily available to advise on study- related medical questions. Medica l monitoring will be performed throughout the study. Safety data will be reviewed regularly by the Lundbeck Safety Committee to ensure that prompt action is taken, if needed. In accordance with Good Clinical Practice ,38the investigator will be responsible for all study - related medical decisions. Informed Consent No study- related procedures , including any screening procedures, may be performed before the investigator has obtained written informed consent from the patient. Changing (for example, discontinuing or down- tapering) a patient’s concomitant medications prior to the Screening Visit to ensure that the patient meets the s election criteria is a study - related activity and must not occur before the Informed Consent Form has been signed. It is the responsibility of the investigator , or person designated by the investigator, to obtain written informed consent from the patient .If the informed consent process isdelegated, the requirements for the delegates must be documented prior to the start of the study.

Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 48of 98The patient will receive IMP starting from the Baseline Visit to follow a Q12W dosing schedule with either eptinezumab or placebo by IV infusion. At Visit 8 patients will enter the Extension Period. Patients who were assigned to placebo in the Placebo- controlled Period will be random ly allocated to one of two treatment groups: eptinezumab 300 mg or eptinezumab 100 mg with a ratio of 1:1. Patients assigned to eptinezumab 300 mg or eptinezumab 100 mg in the Placebo -controlled Period will continue their original assignments. IMP (s), Formulation (s), and Strength (s) The IMP (s)supplied by Lundbeck in this study are: Eptinezumab 100 mg/ml (1ml/ vial) as Concentrate for Solution for Infusion. Patients allocated to the 300 mg eptinezumab treatment group will be dispensed 3 x 100 mg, Solution for Infusion 100 mg/ml added to 100 mL of 0.9% normal saline, intravenously . Patients allocated to the 100 mg eptinezumab treatment group will be dispensed 1 x 100 mg, Solution for Infusion 100 mg/ml added to 100 mL of 0.9% normal saline, intravenousl y. Patients allocated to the placebo treatment group will be dispensed 100 mL of 0.9% normal saline, intravenously. The pharmacist or designee responsible for receiving, storing, preparing, and dispensing eptinezumab and placebo IV infusions will be unblin ded and will not be responsible for other aspects of the clinical study where blinding is necessary. Doses will be administered intravenously over a period of 30 (+15) minutes by the blinded investigator or designee . Further instructions on preparation an d procedures associated with administering the IV can be found in the Pharmacy Manual and Infusion Guidelines . Manufacturing, Packaging, Labelling, and Storage of IMP s The IMP(s) will be manufactured, packaged, labelled, released (by a qualified person [QP]), and distributed in accordance with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice , under the responsibility of Lundbeck. The IMP will be provided in single -use vials (as a concentration for solution for infusion) The wording on the labels will be in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice regarding labelling and national and/or local regulatory requirements. If additional information is to be added when the IMP is dispensed to the patients, this will be clearly stated on the labels, and the investigator will be instructed to do so."
48,page_48,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 49of 98No manipulation, repackaging, or relabelling of IMP is permitted after QP release by Lundbeck, unless a repackaging/relabelling agreement exists, and the documentation is available to Clinical Supply, H. Lundbeck A/S, and, where necessary, new QP releases are made. The IMP swill be identified using a unique IMP number. The IMPs must be stored in a safe and secure location, and in accord ance with the storage conditions specified on the labels. Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional storage and handling procedures. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Interactive response technology (IRT) will be used in this study .Each p atient will be assigned a screening number , and that number will be used to identify the patient throughout the study. When a patient is to be randomized, the unblinded pharmacist or designee will use the IR T. The IR Twill allocate the patient to a treatment group during the call and assign sthe patient a randomization number in accordance with the specifications from Biostatistics, H.Lundbeck A/S. IMP Accountability IMP accountability will be documented in the IRT by the unblinded CRA . The investi gator and the pharmacist must agree to only dispense IMP to patients enrolled in the study. The pharmacist must maintain an adequate record of the receipt and distribution of the IMP(s). This record must be available for inspection at any time. Unblinding Procedures Pharmacovigilance, H. Lundbeck A/S, and the investigator or the pharmacist (if applicable), and the DMC will have access to the unblinded information for the double -blind treatment for each patient. Access to these details will be vi a IRT. The IR T unblinding procedure is described in the IRTUser Guide . The investigator may only break the code for a patient if knowledge of the IMP is necessary to provide optimal treatment to the patient in an emergency situation. If possible, the investigator must consult the CRA in some cases it may be the medical monitor before breaking the code. The investigator must record the date and reason for breaking the code on the IMP Code Break Form . If the emergency situation was an adverse event, it must be recorded on an Adverse Event Form . The CRA (in some cases it may be the medical monitor) must be notified immediately. The IR Twill capture the date and time of the code break call. Information on the allocated treatment will be provided during the call and by fax or email , depending on availability/preference. When the code is broken for a patient, the patient must be immediat ely withdrawn from the study . If this occurs during a visit, the investigator must"
49,page_49,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 50of 98complete the visit as a Withdrawal Visit; otherwise, the patient will be asked to attend a Withdrawal Visit 12 weeks after his/her last dose of IMP. Post- study Access to IM P(s) Patients in the study will have access to appropriate medical care after they complete or withdraw from the study. 7Concomitant Medication General Concomitant medication is any medication other than the IMP that is taken during the study up until the Completion/Withdrawal Visit , including during the Screening Period. The concomitant medications that are disallowed or allowed with restrictions during the study are summarized in Appendix II . Details of all concomitant medication (prescription and over- the-counter) taken <3months prior to the Screening Visit must be recorded in the eCRF at the first visit. Any changes (including reason for changes) in concomitant medication must be recorded at each subsequent visit. Details of all migraine preventive treatment failures (prescription and over- the-counter) taken <10years prior to the Screening Visit must be recorded in the eCRF at the Screeni ng V isit. For any concomitant medication for which the dose has been increased due to worsening of a concurrent disorder after enrolment in the study, the worsening of the disorder must be recorded as an adverse event. For any concomitant medication initiated due to a new disorder after enrolment in the study, the disorder must be recorded as an adverse event. Use of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccine There arecurrently no data indicating that eptinezumab interact swith or impair sthe body´s immunological response to the COVID -19 vaccines. Hence, there are no indications for safety concerns of concomitant use of the C OVID -19 vaccines with eptinezumab. As such, COVID - 19 vaccination is allowed during the eptinezumab studies with the guidance measures describe d in Appendix II . All adverse events , including those judged by the investigator to be related to the COVID -19 vaccine, must be recorded in the eCRF (see section 10.1.1 ). A causality a ssessment, including an alternative causality as relevant, must be provided."

Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 51of 988Study Visit Plan Overview An overview of the procedures and assessments to be conducted during the study and their timing is presented in Panel 2. Further details are in chapter 9. The Screening Visit (Visit 1) is performed 28 to 30 days before the Baseline Visit (Visit 2). Thereafter, study visits are divided into Phone Contacts and IMP Visits. The Primary Outcome Visit (Visit 5) is performed 12 weeks after the Baseline Visit . Pati ents will continue until the Completion Visit ( Visit 2 0) or until the Withdrawal Visit. At Visit 8patients will enter the Extension Period and receive either one of two treatments : eptinezumab 300 mg or eptinezumab 100 mg until the Completion Visit ( Visit 20). Patients will complete a daily headache eDiary from the time of screening until the Completion/Withdrawal Visit. Patients will be given a headache eDiary at the Screening Visit and must be trained in its use and compliance requirements. Patients wil l complete electronic headache diary entries daily. At each clinic visit and phone contact ( that is every 4 weeks) , a compliance check of theeDiary will be conducted .Patients must continue to complete the daily eDiary during the transfer to the Extension Period. Headache data from the eDiary will be made available during the study to site staff for review via the eDiary system portal .See section 9.2.2 for further details on eDiary. All assessments may be completed over a maximum of 2 consecutive days (with the exception of PROs -see below) ; if so, the first day is considered the “visit” day according to the schedule .If the date of a clinic visit or phone contact does not conform to the schedule, subsequent visits should be planned to maintain the visit schedule relative to the B aseline Visit . PROs which are scheduled in alignment with a clinic visit can be completed in the clinic or in the remote setting within 3 days prior to the scheduled clinic visit date. PROs which are scheduled in alignment with a phone contact (PGIC (at Week 4 only), HIT -6, EQ-5D-5L , HCRU, WPAI )must be completed in the remote setting and can be completed on the day or within 3 days prior to the scheduled phone contact date. After completing or withdrawing from the study, the patient must be treated in accordance with usual clinical practice. Screening Visit (Visit 1) Signed informed consent must be in place before any study -related assessments are performed and may be obtained prior to the Screening Visit."

At the Screening Visit, the patient must be assisted with the provisioning and training of the eDiary andwith training of efficacy and pharmacoeconomic assessments (PROs ). Details will be provided in a separate user manual. See section 9.2.2 for further details on eDiary. Exit Interview subset : at the Screening Visit, the patients undergoing the Visit 8exit interviews must provide a signed subset -specific Informed Consent. Details will be provided in a separate exit interview guide. See section 9.5.1 for further details on exit interview. Pre-screening Each site must record in a pre -screening log which patients attended the Screening Visit. Priorto the Baseline Visit, a study -specific Eligibility Form must be completed by the site and transmitted to the CRO for their review . A confirmation that the patient can continue further with the study procedures is required before randomization. Patient Identification Card Each patient will be provided with a patient identification card that states, at a minimum, the name of the IMP, the study number, the patient identification number, the investigator’s name, and an emergency telephone number providing 24- hour service. The patient identification card should be returned to the investigator upon completion of the patient’s participation in the study. Re-screening Rescreening is only allowed for patients with a complete Screening Visit andwho do not fulfil: the required duration of a washout period for a medication that is disallowed prior to screening, or , a stable usage period for a medication that is allowed with restrictions prior to screening. Rescreening may also be allowed for patients with a complete Screening Visit but are required to be in quarantine due to a positive COVID -19 test . The patient mus t already have either started the washout prior to screening or be on the allowed dosage as part of their standard clinical care. Washout or change in dosage may not be done specifically for inclusion into this study."

Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 53of 98Authorization for re -screening may only be granted by the sponsor’s medical expert (or the CRO’s medical monitor) after a thorough review of all data from the original Screening Visit. At the new Screening Visit, the patient must sign a new Informed Consent Form . At the new Screening Visit, the patient will be assigned a new screening number. A re -screened patient must have a complete new Screening Visit, and all the eligibility criteria must be re -assessed at the new Screening Visit. The following information will also be recorded in the eCRF at the new Screening Visit: that the patient has previously been screened for the study that re -screening has been authorized by the sponsor’s medical expert (or the CRO’s medical monitor) the screening number that was assigned to the patient at the o riginal Screening Visit If a patient is re -screened, no data from the original Screening Visit will be used. A patient may only be re -screened once. Baseline Visit + IMP (Visit 2) In exceptional cases, the screening period (visit interval between Screening and Baseline Visits) may be extended with approval from the sponsor provided the Lundbeck medical expert accepts the rationale provided for the extension. The Baseline Visit also includes IMP administration and will occur 28- 30 days after the Screening Vi sit. Inclusion and exclusion criteria review must be done prior to dosing at the Baseline Visit . For procedures preceding and following IMP administration, see section 8.5. Primary Outcome + IMP (Visit 5) The Primary Outcome Visit comprises assessments of the primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints. The Primary Outcome Visit also includes IMP administration .For procedures preceding and following IMP administration, see section 8.5. IMP Visits ( Visit s 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17) At the IMP Visits, the infusion is preceded by assessments of vital signs including body temperature, concomitant medications, AEs, physical examination, ECG ,blood and urine sampling and C -SSRS administration . Assessments involving interviews and scales must be administered before the infusion. PROs will be completed in the clinic the following order; HIT-6, PGIC, MBS, MSQ v2 .1, EQ -5D- 5L, HCRU, WPAI.

A compliance check of the eDiary will be conducted and the patient must be assisted with re-training if necessary .See section 9.2.2 for further details on eDiary. Patients will be monitored for at least 1 hour following end-of-infusion and before being discharged from the clinic. Patients will be requested to stay longer should the investigator determine this is clinically warranted. After the infusion, the patients will be under observation, but not confined to bed, unless the investigator decides, based on the patie nt’s condition, that it is in the best interest of the patient to be confined to bed. Vital signs including body temperature, infusion related reactions (IRRs )and AEs will be checked after infusion and before the patient is discharged from the site. AEs should be collected prior to assessment of IR Rs. Exit Interview subset : The exit interview will be conducted at Visit 8(Week 24 Visit or at the Withdrawal Vis itfor patients who withdraw prior to Week 24). The exit interview must be conducted after all visit assessments are completed. A visit window of 2weeks is allowed for the exit interview from the last assessment conducted for Visit 8/Withdrawal Visit (for patients who withdraw prior to Week 24) . See section 9.5.1 for further details on the exit interview. Phone Contacts (Visits 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19) The patient will be contacted via phone every 4 weeks between infusion visits for eDiary compliance check , to ensure that selected assessments have been completed and for collection of relevant information such as AEs and concomitant medication. A compliance check of the eDiary will be conducted and the patient must be assisted with re- training if necessary .See section 9.2.2 for further details on eDiary. Additionally, the following PROs must be completed in the remote setting in alignment with the scheduled phone contacts (see Panel 2):PGIC (at Week 4 only), HIT -6, EQ-5D-5L , HCRU, WPAI. These can be completed on the day or within 3 days prior to the scheduled phone contact date. Only site staff trained and listed in the delegation log will conduct phone contacts and hence be allowed to call the patient. Each phone contact must be documented in medical notes and used for source data verification when completing the eCRF and for subsequent monitoring. Phone contacts should be planned to maintain the visit schedule relative to the Baseline Visit. Completion Visit (Visit 20) Patients who complete the study will attend a Completion Visit . As the visit will be scheduled 12 weeks after the last dose of IMP , the Completion Visit will also serve as a Safety Follow -up Visit for all patients ( section 8.10)."
54,page_54,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 55of 98At the Completion Visit, the patient must be assisted with the closeout of the eDi ary. Patients who test positive for ADA at the Completion Visit will be asked to provide up to two additional blood samples for immunogenicity testing at 12 -week intervals for up to 24 weeks. Unscheduled Visit An unscheduled visit may occur throughout this study if needed. Unscheduled visits can be completed if required as either site or telephone visits. At these visits clinical safety laboratory tests, ECG, vital signs can be performed. In case of any additional tests performed not covered by the existing tests specified in the protocol and the eCRF, the results can be reported in connection with an AE reporting ( see chapter 10) or documented in the medical notes as applicable. Withdrawal Visit Patients who withdraw from the study will be as ked to attend a Withdrawal Visit, if at all possible. The visit must be scheduled 12 for weeks after the last dose of IMP after withdrawal. As the Withdrawal Visit will be scheduled 12 weeks after the last dose of IMP , this visit will also serve as a Safety Follow -up Visit for all withdrawn patients (section 8.10). Patients who withdraw prior to Week 24 will undergo additional efficacy evaluations , thus for these patients t he Withdrawal Visit will also serve as a nEfficacy Follow -up Visit. At the Withdrawal Visit, the patient must be assisted with the closeout of the eDiary. No new information will be collected from patients who withdraw from the study, except information collected in relation to the scheduled Withdrawal Visit or needed for the follow -up of adverse events (section 10.5). The reason for withdrawal must be recorded in the eCRF. For a patient who withdraws consent: if the patient wi thdraws consent during a visit and then agrees to it being the final visit, the investigator will complete the visit as a Withdrawal Visit and all the data collected up to and including that visit will be used if the patient withdraws consent during a telephone conversation, the investigator will ask the patient if they will attend a Withdrawal Visit 12 weeks after their last dose . If the patient: agrees to attend a Withdrawal Visit, all the data collected up t o and including that visit will be used refuses to attend a Withdrawal Visit, the investigator should attempt to follow the patient’s safety and future treatment; any information collected will only be recorded in the patient’s medical records if the patient explicitly requests that the patient’s data collected from the time of withdrawal of consent onwards not be used, this will be respected"

A safety follow -up is conducted to capture adverse events that occur after the last IMP or Phone Contact Visit (whichever is later) as well as to follow up on the out come of adverse events ongoing at that visit at the Completion/Withdrawal Visit. For adverse events that were ongoing at the last IMP or Phone Contact Visit and that resolved by theCompletion/Withdrawal Visit , the stop date must be recorded. For non- serio us adverse events still ongoing at the C ompletion/Withdrawal Visits , the Ongoing Adverse Event checkbox on the Adverse Event Form must be ticked. SAEs must be followed until resolution or the outcome is known. For patients with a clinically significant out-of-range clinical safety laboratory test value at the Completion or Withdrawal Visit or who withdrew due to an elevated AST or ALT value (see section 5.4), safety follow -up should be scheduled and recorded in the patients’ medical records and not in the eCRF ; see section 10.5 for details. The safety follow -up for patients who withdraw consent must be performed, if at all possible; any information collected will be recorded in the patients’ medical records. End-of-study Definition The end of the study for an individual patient is defined as the last protocol -specified contact with that patient. The overall end of the study is defined as the last protocol -specified contact with the last patient ongoing in the study. 9Assessments Screening and Baseline Procedures and Assessments Demographics and Baseline Characteristics Prior to enrolling a patient in the study, the investigator must ascertain that the patient meets the selection criteria.

TheCOA tool s will be administered in the local language. Only those provided by Lundbeck that have been validated in the language to which they have been translated will be used in this study. The following COA tools will be used: eDiary –to assess daily headache and migraine variables, that is the number of hours with headache, presence of associated symptoms, and use of acute migraine medications start and stop dates, headache severity PGIC -to assess overall change in the severity of illness following treatment MBS -to assess a migraine -related symptom that is most bothersome for the patient Detailed instructions on how to complete/ administer the COA tools will be provided to the site in a PRO Guidel ine. eDiary The patient will be instructed to complete an electronic diary (eDiary) daily from the Screening Visit until the Completion/Withdrawal Visit .The eDiary consists of applications and reports which will be used to derive the migraine and headache endpoints. At the Screening Visit, the patient must be assisted with the provisioning and training of the eDiary. During the Completion/Withdrawal Visit, eDiary close out must be performed while the patient is on site. Details will be provided in a separate user manual . At the Screening Visit, each patient will receive comprehensive training from site staff on the use of the eDiary. Site staff will also instruct patients on the requirement for timely and daily completion of the eDiary. The content of the headache diary is developed on key symptoms and characteristics as mentioned in the definition of migraine (see section 9.1.2) . The day of eDiary distribution will start the 28- day eDiary Screening Period during which t he patient will record daily information regarding headache characteristics, severi ty, length, and intake of headache/migraine medication. Headache and migraine items will be assessed with a yes/no response; and severity will be rated as mild, moderate or severe. An eDiary Eligibility Report will be used to summarize baseline headache an d migraine days and eDiary compliance during the Screening Period . Any patient found to be ineligible for the study during the screening period or prior to randomization or dosing will not be randomized or dosed. On each day during the study until the Completion/Withdrawal Visit , the patient will be asked to record diary data for the previous 24 -hour period. For each day, the patient sho uld record if they experienced any headache. For each experienced headache, the start and stop date and time will be collected. Information included in the definition of a migrain e(for instance, headache severity, additional symptoms, and use of acute med ication) will also be collected .

Headache and Compliance data from the eDiary will be made available during the study to site staff for review via the eDiary system portal. At least 85% compliance is needed during the screening period and throughout the study until the Completion/Withdrawal Visit. Site staff will counsel patients as needed on the importance of completing the eDiary daily. All follow -up with patients regarding eDiary compliance should be documented in the source records. At the Completion/Withdrawal Visit, the patient must be assisted with the closeout of the eDiary. Patient Global Impression of Change ( PGIC ) The PGIC is a single patient -reported item reflecting the patient’s impression of change in their disease status since the start of the study ( that is , in relation to activity limitations, symptoms, emotions, and overall quality of life) . The item is rated on a 7- point scale (very much improved; much improved; minimally improved; no change; minimally worse; much worse; very much worse) , where a high score indicate sworsening. It takes approximate 1 minute to complete the scale. Most Bothersome Symptom ( MBS ) The Investigator will verbally obtain the most bothersome symptom associated with the patient’s migraines during the Baseline Visit. Patients will be asked to rate the improvement in this symptom from baseline on a 7 -point scale identical to the scale use d for the PGIC . The MBS areas include: nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound , mental cloudiness, fatigue, pain with activity, mood changes, other .

Thelife impact derived from the total score is described as followed: Severe ( ≥60), Substantial (56-59), Some (50 -55), Little to None ( ≤49). It takes less than 5 minutes to complete the HIT-6 questionnaire. 9.3.1.3 Migraine -Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, version 2.1 (MSQ v2.1) The MSQ v2.144is a patient -reported outcome designed to assess the quality of life in patients with migraine . Itconsists of 14 items cover ingthree domains: role function restrictive (7 items) ; role function preventive (4 items) ; and emotional function (3 items) . Each item is scored on a 6 -point scale ranging from 1 (none of the time) to 6 (all of the time). Raw d omain scores are summed and transformed to a 0 to 100 point scale. Higher scores indicate better quality of life. It takes approximately 5 -10 minutes to complete the MSQ v2.1. 9.3.1.4 Euroqol 5 Dimension –5 Levels (EQ -5D- 5L) The EQ -5D-5L45is a patient -reported assessment designed to measure the patient’s well- being. It consists of 5 descriptive items (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and depression/anxiety) and a visual analogue scale (VAS) of the overall health state . Each descriptive item is rated on a 5 -point index r anging from 1 (no problems) to 5 (extreme problems) and a single summary index (from 0 to 1) can be calculated. The VAS ranges from 0 (worst imaginable health state ) to 100 ( best imaginable health state ). It takes approximately 5 minutes to complete the EQ -5D-5L. 9.3.1.5 Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU) Migraine -specific healthcare resource utilization information will be collected in terms of outpatient health care professional visits, emergency room visi ts, hospital admissions, as well as duration of hospital stays. Clinical site personnel and patients will be instructed to capture utilization that takes place outside of visits associated with their participation in the clinical trial. 9.3.1.6 Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: Migraine (WPAI:M) The WPAI46is a patient self -rated scale designed to provide a quantitative measure of the work productivity and activity impairment due to a specific health problem (WPAI:M). The WPAI assesses activities over the preceding 7 days and consists of 6 items: 4 items as sess the number of hours worked, the number of hours missed from work due to the patient’s condition, or due to other reasons, and 2 visual numerical scales to assess how much the patient’s condition affects their productivity at work and their ability to complete normal daily activities.

Although the potential future exploratory biomarker analyses will help to increase our understanding of the aetiology of migraine and the molecular basis of the drug response, the efforts described in this prot ocol are strictly research based. Therefore, as the complex interactions between genes , biomarkers and disease are currently not characterized to a level that translates to a meaningful clinical advantage, individual results from the exploratory biomarker analyses will as per usual not be given to either thestudy participants or the investigator . For the same reasons, individual results will not be added to the patients’ medical records. The patients will have no direct benefit from the exploratory bioma rker analyses. To ensure privacy protection, the blood samples for RNA gene expression profiling, proteomics/metabolomics analysis and future ADA assessments will be single -coded using the patient’s screening number. The blood samples for the pharmacogenetic biomarker analysis will be double -coded, that is one code key will be stored at the site and the other at Lundbeck. To link a DNA sample to a specific subject, both code keys are needed. The blood samples collected for the possible future exploratory b iomarker analysis may be shared with academic and public institutions and other companies. However, Lundbeck will retain full control of the samples and their use in accordance with the information in the Patient Information Sheet and a Material Transfer A greement . Furthermore, the results based on the analysis of the samples may be pooled across studies to increase the statistical power of the analyses. Blood Sampling for Gene Expression Profiling Blood samples for gene expression profiling will be collect ed in two PAXgene RNA tubes (2.5mL) in accordance with Panel 2.The maximum volume of blood to be collected during the study for this purpose will be 25 mL. Samples for gene expression profiling will be shipped to Lundbeck Biobank (at Brooks Life Scienc es, Indianapolis, IN, USA) for storage. Sample preparation and analysis may be performed by CRO or by a bona fide research collaborator."

Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 71of 98 Blood Sampling for Metabolomics and/or Proteomics Blood samples for plasma separation and metabolomics and/or proteomic s will be collected in one 10 mL K 2EDTA tube in accordance with Panel 2. The maximum volume of blood to be collected during the study for this purpos e will be 50 mL. Samples for metabolomics and/or proteomics will be shipped to Lundbeck Biobank (at Brooks Life Sciences, Indianapolis, IN, USA) for storage. Sample preparation and analysis may be performed by CRO or by a bona fide research collaborator. Blood Sampling for Pharmacogenetics It is optional for the patient to donate a blood sample for exploratory pharmacogenetic analysis. Blood samples for subsequent DNA extraction and aliquoting will be collected in 9mL K 3 EDTA tube in accordance with Panel 2. The maximum volume of blood to be collected during the study for this purpose will be 9mL. The extracted DNA al iquots will be shipped to Lundbeck Biobank (at Brooks Life Sciences, Indianapolis, IN, USA) for storage. Sample preparation and analysis may be performed by CRO or by a bona fide research collaborator. The genetic variants to be analysed may include single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variations (CNVs). The analytical methods may be polymerase chain reaction (PCR), qPCR quantitative PCR), sequencing, or whole genome scans on microarrays. Blood sampling for possible future anti -drug antib ody assessments Whole blood samples for serum separation and potential future anti -eptinezumab antibody analyses will be collected in 2 mL silica clot activator (SST) tube in accordance with Panel 2. The maximum volume of blood to be collected during the study for this purpose will be 4 mL. The samples for future anti -drug antibody assessments will be shipped to Lundbeck Biobank (at Brooks Life Sciences, Indianapolis, IN, USA) for storage. Sample preparation and analysis may be performed by CRO or by a bona fide research collaborator. Order of Assessments The assessments should preferably be administered in the following order: No study related activities must be conducted until after the applicable Informed Consent Form is signed. Screening Visit : Blood and urine sampling for clinical safet y laboratory tests must be scheduled and results reviewed prior to the Baseline Visit."
71,page_71,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 72of 98At the Screening Visit the “Baseline/Screening” version of the Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale will be used. At each following visit, the “Since Last Visit” versi on of the C -SSRS will be used. Clinic Visits: PROs must be complete d at the patient’s convenience before or after blood and urine sampling. On clinic visit days, patients must complete the daily eDiary entries prior to infusion . PROs completed in the clinic must be done before the infusion. HIT-6should preferably be the first PRO completed , followed by the PGIC, MBS, MSQ v2 .1, EQ -5D-5L, HCRU, WPAI . Alternatively, PROs thatare scheduled in alignment with a clinic visit can be complete d in the remote setting within 3 days prior to the scheduled clinic visit date. It is also preferable that the same order of assessments is used per patient and if the scheduled time of the day for the assessments is as consistent as possible across all th e study visits. Infusion must be preceded by the assessment of vital signs including body temperature, concomitant medications, AEs, physical examination, ECG, blood sampling and urine sampling and C -SSRS administration. Vital signs must be assessed prior to blood sampling. Vital signs including body temperature, IRRs and AEs will be checked after infusion and before the patient is discharged from the site. IRRs must be assessed after the AE collection. For procedures pre ceding and following IMP administration, see section 8.5. Clinic Visits and Phone Contacts : Acompliance check of the eDiary must be conducted and the patient must be assisted with re-training if necessary. See section 9.2.2 forfurther details on the eDiary. Phone Contacts: The patient will be contacted via phone every 4 weeks between infusion visits for eDiary compliance check , to ensure that selected assessments (PGIC (at Week 4 only), HIT-6, EQ-5D-5L , HCRU, WPAI) have been completed and for collection of relevant information such as AEs and concomitant medication . Exit Interview subset : The exit interview will be conducted shortly ( no later than 2 weeks ) after Visit 8(Week 24 Visit or at the Withdrawal Visit for patients who withdraw prior to Week 24). The exit interview must be conducted after all visit assessments are completed. A visit window of 2 weeks is allowed for the exit interview from the last assessment conducted for Visit 8/Withdrawal Visit (for patients who withdr aw prior to Week 24) . See section 9.5.1 for further details on the exit interview. Total Volume of Blood Drawn and Destruction of Biological Material The total volume of blood drawn from each patient will be approximately 300 mL during the study. Additional blood samples may be required if the original blood samples are not viable or if re - testing is required."

The biobank blood samples and any derived material for potential future exploratory pharmacogenetic analyses will be destroyed ≤15years after the end of the stu dy (see definition in section 8.11). Treatment Compliance Responsible study personnel will administer the infusions of IMP. Treatment compliance verification should be documented in the patient’s source documents and study specific IMP documents and verified by a CRA during monitoring. Anyone administering the IMP to the patient must be listed in the delegation log. The information from the IMP Admi nistration Form must be entered in the eCRF. 10Adverse Events Definitions Adverse Event Definitions48 Adverse event – is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study patient administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended s ign (including clinically significant out -of-range values from relevant tests, such as clinical safety laboratory tests, vital signs, ECGs), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, regardless of whether it is consider ed related to the medicinal product. It is Lundbeck policy to collect and record all adverse events, including pre -treatment adverse events, that is, those that start after the patient has signed the Informed Consent Form and prior to the first dose of IMP . Serious adverse event (SAE) –is any adverse event that: results in death is life -threatening (this refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death had it been more severe) requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization"
73,page_73,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 74of 98results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity is a congenital anomaly/birth defect is medically important (this refers to an event t hat may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent any of the SAEs defined above) Examples of medically important events are intensive treatment for aller gic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Planned hospitalizations or surgical interventions for a condition that existed before the patient signed the Informed Consent Form and that did not change in intensity are not adverse events. Emergency room visits that do not result in admission to the hospital are not necessarily SAEs; however, they must be evaluated to determine whether they meet any of the SAE definit ions (for example, life -threatening or other serious [medically important] event) . Non-serious adverse event –is any adverse event that does not meet the definition of an SAE. If there is any doubt as to whether an adverse event meets the definition of an SAE, a conservative viewpoint must be taken, and the adverse event must be reported as an SAE. Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) –is any adverse event that is assessed as serious, unexpected (its nature or intensity is not consistent with the current version of the Investigator’s Brochure29), and related to a medicinal product by either the investigator or Lundbeck. Overdose –is a dose taken by a patient that exceeds the dose prescribed to that patient. Any overdose (and associated symptoms) must, at a minimum, be re corded as a non- serious adverse event. Adverse Event Assessment Definitions Assessment of Intensity The investigator must assess the intensity of the adverse event using the following definitions, and record it on the Adverse Event Form : Mild –the adverse event causes minimal discomfort and does not interfere in a significant manner with the patient’s normal activities. Moderate –the adverse event is sufficiently uncomfortable to produce some impairment of the patient’s normal activities. Severe –the adv erse event is incapacitating, preventing the patient from participating in the patient’s normal activities."
74,page_74,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 75of 98Assessment of Causal Relationship The investigator must assess the causal relationship between the adverse event and the IMP using the following def initions, and record it on the Adverse Event Form and the Serious Adverse Event Form (if applicable): Probable – the adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to the IMP or recurs on rechallenge, and another aetiology is unlikely or significantly less likely. Possible –the adverse event has a suggestive temporal relationship to the IMP, and an alternative a etiology is equally or less likely. Not related –the adverse event has no temporal relationship to the IMP or is due to underlying/concurrent disorder or effect of another drug (that is, there is no causal relationship between the IMP and the adverse even t). An adverse event is considered causally related to the use of the IMP when the causality assessment is probable or possible . For pre -treatment adverse events, a causality assessment is not relevant. Assessment of Outcome The investigator must assess t he outcome of the adverse event using the following definitions, and record it on the Adverse Event Form and the Serious Adverse Event Form (if applicable): Recovered –the patient has recovered completely, and no symptoms remain. Recovering –the patient’ s condition is improving, but symptoms still remain. Recovered with sequelae –the patient has recovered, but some symptoms remain (for example, the patient had a stroke and is functioning normally, but has some motor impairment). Not recovered –the patie nt’s condition has not improved ,and the symptoms are unchanged (for example, an atrial fibrillation has become chronic). Death Pregnancy Although not necessarily considered an adverse event, a pregnancy in a patient in the study must be recorded on an Adverse Event Form , as well as on a Pregnancy Form (paper), even if no adverse event associated with the pregnancy has occurred. Pregnancies must be reported to Lundbeck using the same expedited reporting timelines as those for SAEs. An uncomplicated pregnancy should not be reported as an SAE; hospitalization for a normal birth should not be reported as an SAE. If, however, the pregnancy is associated with an SAE, the appropriate serious criterion must be indicated on the Serious Adverse Event Form . Example s of pregnancies to be reported as SAEs (medically important) are spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and malformations."
75,page_75,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 76of 98The investigator must follow up on the outcome of the pregnancy and report it on a Pregnancy Form (paper). The follow -up must include information on the neonate at least up until the age of 1 month. Recording Adverse Events Adverse events (including pre -treatment adverse events) must be recorded on an Adverse Event Form . The investigator must provide information on the adverse event, preferably with a diagnosis, or at least with signs and symptoms; start and stop dates (and start and stop time if the adverse event lasts less than 24 hours) ; intensity; causal relationshi p to the IMP; action taken; and outcome. If the adverse event is not related to the IMP, an alternative aetiology must be recorded, if available. If the adverse event is an overdose, the nature of the overdose must be stated (for example, medication erro r, accidental overdose, or intentional overdose). If the intensity changes during the course of the adverse event, this must be recorded on the AE Intensity Log . If the adverse event is serious , this must be indicated on the Adverse Event Form . Furthermo re, the investigator must fill out a Serious Adverse Event Form and report the SAE to Lundbeck immediately (within 24 hours) after becoming aware of it (see section 10.4). If individual adverse events are later linked to a specific diagnosis, the diagnosis should be reported and linked to the previously reported adverse events. Reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) The investigator must report SAEs to Lundbeck immediately (within 24 hours) after becoming aware of them by completing a Serious Adverse Event Form . The initial Serious Adverse Event Form must contain as much information as possible and, if more informatio n about the patient’s condition becomes available, the Serious Adverse Event Form must be updated with the additional information. If the investigator cannot report the SAE in Rave®, then he or she must complete and sign the Serious Adverse Event Fallback Form and send it to: Fax: +45 36 30 99 67 email: ICSRquery@lundbeck.com Lundbeck will assume responsibility for reporting SAEs to the authorities in accordance with local requirements. It is the investigator’s responsibility to be familiar with local re quirements regarding reporting SAEs to the EC or IRB and to act accordingly. Lundbeck will assume responsibility for reporting SUSARs to the authorities in accordance with local requirements. In those Member States of the European Union that have implemen ted the European Union Clinical Trials Directive49and in Norway, Liechtenstein,"
76,page_76,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 77of 98and Iceland, that is, in the countries where unblinded expedited safety reporting is required, Lundbeck will also assume responsibility for reporting SUSARs to the ECs. Lundbe ck will assess the expectedness of SAEs and inform the investigator(s) about SUSARs in the blinded SUSAR listings. Treatment and Follow -up of Adverse Events Patients with adverse events must be treated in accordance with usual clinical practice at the discretion of the investigator. Non-serious adverse events must be followed up until resolution or the Completion /Withdrawal Visit, whichever comes first. At the Completion/Withdrawal Visit , information on new AEs, if any, and stop dates for previously report ed adverse events must be recorded. The investigator must follow up on all SAEs until the patient has recovered, stabilized, or recovered with sequelae, and report to Lundbeck all relevant new information using the same procedures and timelines as those fo r the initial Serious Adverse Event Form . SAEs that are spontaneously reported by a patient to the investigator after the Completion/Withdrawal Visit must be handled in the same manner as SAEs that occur during the study. These SAEs will be recorded in the Lundbeck safety database. Patients with a clinically significant out -of-range clinical safety laboratory test value at the Completion or Withdrawal Visit must be followed in accordance with usual clinical practice. If the clinically significant out-of- range clinical safety laboratory test value has not normalized or stabilized or a diagnosis or a reasonable explanation has not been esta blished by the Safety Follow -up at the Completion/Withdrawal Visit, the investigator must decide whether further follow -up visits are required (this may include an additional medical examination and/or additional blood sampling). If further follow -up visi ts are made, these must be documented in the patient’s medical records and not in the eCRF. Patients who withdraw due to an elevated AST or ALT value (see section 5.4) must be followed until the values normalize or stabilize or a diagnosis or a reasonable explanation has been established. Additional medical examinations (for example, ultrasound scanning and/or sampling for serology, conjugated biliru bin, prothrombin time) should be considered. Agastroenterology or hepatology consultation should also be considered. Management of Reactions to Study Drug There are no specific antidotes to eptinezumab. A medical emergency should be treated appropriately by the Investigator using proper standard of care and according to local guidelines for that emergency condition. Emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of these potential adverse events must be available for immediate use."
77,page_77,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 78of 98Should a medical condition arise that the investigator believes is related to the study drug, clinical judgment should be used to provide the appropriate response, including the consideration of discontinuation of study drug. If a patient experiences an anaphylactic react ion or another severe and/or serious hypersensitivity reaction during the IMP infusion, as assessed by the investigator, the infusion must be discontinued immediately (see section 5.4) and appropriate therapy instituted. Any events believed to be allergic reactions should be discussed with the medical monitor. The site will have the possibility to collect ,at the time of the event, additional blood specimens using the immune response lab kit, per the laboratory manual .This assessment includes serum histamine, serum tryptase, immunoglobulin E, and complement components. Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) The DMC will consist of medical doctors with speciality relevant to the fields of neurology and cardiology, as well as a biostatistician. The DMC will monitor safety data on an ongoing basis in addition to cumulative safety data. The DMC will be informed to what e xtent the data and analyses provided to them have been quality controlled. Members of the DMC will not be involved in other study -related tasks. The DMC procedures are described in the Data Monitoring Committee Charter . 11Data Handling and Record Keeping Data Collection Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) eCRFs will be used to collect all the data related to the study, except the external data described in section 11.1.3 . The eCRFs use third party software (Rave®) to capture data via an online system on a computer. When the investigator enters data in the eCRF (ideally during the visit or as soon as possible [<3 days] thereafter), the d ata will be recorded electronically in a central database over encrypted lines, and all entries and modifications to the data will be logged in an audit trail. Access to the system will only be granted after appropriate and documented training. Written instructions for using the system will be provided along with the training. Electronic signatures will be used where signatures are required on pages and/or visits. Automated data entry checks will be implemented where appropriate; other data will be reviewed and eval uated for accuracy by the sponsor and/or representatives from CRO . All entries, corrections, and changes must be made by the investigator or a delegate."

Details on derivation and imputations of days with missing or incomplete eDiary data will be described in the SAP. Changes from baseline in MMDs at the 6 firs t 4-week intervals will be analysed using a restricted maximum likelihood (REML) -based mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach. The analysis will be performed using all available monthly change scores for the first 6 months in the study .

In addition, the model will include treatment -by-week interaction, baseline HIT -6 score -by-week interaction, and stratum-by- week interaction. An unstructured covariance structure will be used to model the within -patient errors. The Kenward- Roger approximation will be used to estimate denominator degrees of freedom. Treatment effects will be calculated based on least squares means for the treatment -by- week interaction estimated at W eek 12. Change from baseline in the number of MMDs (Weeks 13 -24), will be analysed using the same MMRM m ethodology as for the primary endpoint. The comparisons will be the contrasts between each dose of eptinezumab and placebo averaged across Weeks 13 -24. Sensitivity Analyses of the Key Secondary Endpoints Endpoints where data imputation is used, the impact of the imputations will be assessed in sensitivity analyses, applying different methods of imputation. Details will be specified in the SAP. Testing St rategy The testing strategy will be a sequence of tests, either testing one endpoint at a time or using Bonferroni -Holm to test a group of endpoints. Only if one step has shown a statistically significant effect will the formal testing continue with the ne xt step, thus ensuring protection of the type 1 error. The steps are described below. A significance level of 0.05 will be used. The significance level is denoted by α below. Step1 Test the primary endpoint change from baseline in MMDs (Weeks 1- 12) for the 300 mg dose compared to placebo on a significance level of α. Only if the p- value <α in favour of the 300mg dose is the effect considered statistically significant and the testing continues with the next step. Step 2 Test the key secondary endpoint 50% responders for MMD (Weeks 1- 12) for the 300 mg dose compared to placebo, using a significance level of α. Only if the p -value <α in favour of the"
85,page_85,"H. Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 86of 98300 mg dose is the effect considered statistically significant and the testing continues with the next step. Step 3 Test the primary endpoint change from baseline in MMDs (Weeks 1- 12) for the 100 mg dose compared to placebo on a significance level of α. Only if the p- value <α in favour of the 100 mg dose is the effect considered statistically significant and the testing continues with the next step. Step 4 Test the key secondary endpoint 50% responders for MMD (Weeks 1 -12) for the 100 mg dose compared to placebo, using a significance level of α. Only if the p -value <α in favour of the 100 mg dose is the effect considered statistically significant and the testing continues with the next step. Step 5 Uses Bonferroni -Holm to test the 3 key secondary endpoints: Change from baseline in MMDs (Weeks 13- 24), 75% responders for MMD (Weeks 1- 12), Change from baseline to Week 12 in HIT -6. All comparisons are of the 300 mg dose compared to placebo. If the smallest of the 3 p-values is <α /3 in favour of the 300 mg dose then the effect seen on this endpoint is considered statistically significant, and the testing continues. Next, if the second smallest p-value is <α/2 in favour of the 300 mg dose, then the effect seen on this endpoint is considered statistically significant, and the testing continues. If the largest p -value is <α in favour of the 300 mg dose then the effect seen on this endpoint is considered statistically significant, and the testing continues. Step 6 Uses Bonferroni -Holm to test the 3 key secondary endpoints: Change from baseline in MMDs (Weeks 13- 24), 75% responders for MMD (Weeks 1- 12), Change from baseline to Week 12 in HIT -6. All comparisons are of the 100 mg dose compared to placebo. If the smallest of the 3 p-values is <α /3 in favour of the 100 mg dose, then the effect seen on this endpoint is considered statistically significant, and the testing continues. Next, if the second smallest p--value is <α/2 in favour of the 100 mg dose, then the effect seen on this endpoint is considered statistically significant, and the testing continues. If the largest p -value is <α in favour of the 100 mg dos e then, the effect seen on this endpoint is considered statistically significant. Analysis of the Secondary Endpoints Analyses of continuous data based on diary data will use a similar model to the primary analysis, and continuous scale endpoints will be a nalysed by the same MMRM methodology as for HIT -6. Response variables will use similar analyses as thekey secondary response"

The endpoints ;patients with a migraine on the day after first dosing and 100% responders for MMDs and MHDs (Weeks 1-12) will be analysed using an extended Cochran - Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test, adjusting for the stratification factor (MHDs at baseline: ≤14/>14) . Analysis of the Exploratory Endpoints Analyses of continuous data based on diary data will use a similar model t o the primary analysis, and continuous scale endpoints will be analysed by the same MMRM methodology as for HIT -6. Response variables will use similar analyses as the key secondary response endpoints. Analysis of Subgroups Details of subgroup analyses will be specified in the SAP. Safety Analyses Analysis of Adverse Events Adverse events will be classified according to the time of onset of the adverse event: pre-treatment adverse event – an adverse event that starts on or after the date the patient signed the Informed Consent Form and prior to the date and time of first infusion of IMP treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) –an adverse event that starts or increases in intensity during or after administration of the first dose of IMP. Adverse events, sorted by system organ class (SOC) and preferred term, will be summarized. Allocation of TEAEs to Study Periods TEAEs willbe allocated to study periods (these will be defined in the Statis tical Analysis Plan ). Analysis of Other Safety Endpoints The clinical safety laboratory test values, vital signs, and ECG parameter values will be summarized. Potentially clinically significant (PCS) values will be flagged and summarized. Non-suicidal sel f-injury behaviour (considered separately) and no suicidal ideation or behaviour or the worst suicidal ideation or behaviour will be summarised for the double -blind treatment Period and the extension Period ."

Lundbeck A/S Confidential Study 18898A –Clinical Study Protocol Page 88of 98 Sample Size and Power The two prior eptinezumab Phase III studies ,PROMISE -1performed in an EM population andPROMISE -2performed in a CM population ,had the following effect sizes for the primary endpoint when compared to placebo (standard deviations): EM: 100 mg 0.69 (3.1), 300 mg 1.11 (3 .1) CM: 100 mg 2.03 (5.8), 300 mg 2.60 (5.8) The power was determined by simulating the testing strategy (10000 simulations) assuming normal distributions with similar mean and SD for continuous endpoints and similar success rates as the response variables in the Phase III studies for the corresponding population (EM or CM) without assuming the variables to be correlated. With 280 patients per treatment group, assuming that 40% of the patients will be from the EM population and 60% from the CM population, a nd that 2% of the patients do not have a post -baseline assessment of the primary endpoint, simulations show that the power for the test of the primary endpoint is approximately 94% for the comparison of 100 mg to placebo and 99% power for the comparison of 300 mg to placebo. The individual key secondary endpoints had a power of at least 68% for showing an effect, with a combined power of 58% for seeing an effect for all primary and key secondary endpoints and both doses in the testing strategy.
