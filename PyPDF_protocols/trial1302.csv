Amendment 4 (19December 2019 ) The overall reason sfor the amendment: To update safety information to align with the ibrutinib Investigator’s Brochure (IB) to include information regarding cerebrovascular accidents as a new safety observation identified from the post -marketing setting ,and to clarify that assessment of pulse/he art rate and blood pressure is expected at every protocol -specified visit. Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s) Rationale: To update the safety foribrutinib , including information on cerebrovascular accidents . Attachment 1, Ibrutinib RisksSafety information on ibrutinib updated to align with the current IB . Rationale: To clarify that regular monitoring of pulse/heart rate and blood pressure is expected at every protocol -specified visit. Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4 (Tim e and Events Schedules); 9.5 Safety EvaluationsAdditional pulse/heart rate and blood pressure assessments added. Footnote sadded to clarify that pulse/heart rate and blood pressure should be recorded in source documents but will not be routinely collected in the eCR F. Vital signs description updated to specify pulse/heart rate and blood pressure evaluation is expected at every visit ,and guidelines on monitoring and management of cardiovascular toxicities was added. In addition, ECG text was updated to clarify the timing for assessment and optimal monitoring and management of cardiovascular toxicities ( consider consultation with a cardiologist ). Rationale: To clarify the baseline evaluations to be conducted f or those subjects who receive subsequent therapy with single -agent ibrutinib . Table 4 (Time and Events Schedule)The follow ing baseline evaluations were added: medical history, CIRS score, ECOG PS, ECG, vitals, weight , and hepatitis testing . A clarifying footnote (footnote c) w as added to specify that only new medical conditions since the initial screening period or medical conditions that have worsened since baseline should be captured in the case report form and CIRS only needs to be re-evaluated if new or w orsening medical conditions are reported. Rationale: To clarify that annual CT imaging during subsequent therapy with single -agent ibrutinib should coincide w ith disease evaluation visits. Table 4 ( Time and Events Schedule; footnote g)CT im aging is expected for subjects who were initially treated w ith I+VEN (Treatment Arm A); this will occur at the following timepoints: baseline, Week 16, Week 48, and annually thereafter coinciding with the DE visits until progression."
6,page_6,"JNJ-54179060 (ibrutinib) Clinical Protocol 54179060CLL3011 Amendment 4 7 Approved , Date: 19 December 2019Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s) Rationale: To clarify that subjects in Treatment Arm B remain eligible for subsequent therapy with single -agent ibrutinib even if they do not complete open -label therapy because this would not be expected to affect response and tolerability to ibrutinib. Synopsis (Over view of Study Design); Figure 2; Section 3.1 Overvie w of Study Design ;Section 3.2 Study Design Rationale; 9.1.5.1 Eligibility for the Subsequent Therapy PhaseRemoved text specifying that treatment with I+VEN or G -Clb needs to be completed to be eligible for subsequent therapy with single -agent ibrutinib. Figure 2 bullet on “completed study treatment” updated to specify that this pertains to Arm A. The text w as updated to clarify that subjects randomized to Treatment Arm B may remain eligible for subsequent therapy even if the protocol -specified treatment is not completed . Rationale: To clarify that serum chemistry and hematology assessments may be d one outside of the treating institution for non -cycle visits. Table 4 (Time and Events Schedule ; footnote e )Footnote “e” added to clarify that testing may be done outside of the treating institution for non -cycle visits. Rationale: To clarify that medical history needs to be reviewed as complete before a subject is considered eligible to receive subsequent therapy with single -agent ibrutinib. 9.1.5 Subsequent Therapy PhaseAdded that eligibility review should include revie w that medical history iscomplete. Rationale: Toremove specificity that a stratified analysis will be done for overall survival because the number of events may be too small in some of the strata . 11.4 Efficacy Analyses; 11.4.2 Secondary EndpointsDeleted term “stratified” when describing the overall survival analysis. The details will be specified in the final Statistical Analysis Plan. Rationale : To addan external link for examples of CYP3A inhibitors and inducers . Attachment 5 Inserted an additional link to FDA classification of CYP3A inhibitors and inducers . Rationale: Throughout the protocol, minor grammatical, formatting, or spelling changes were made as needed . Amendment 3(12August 2019 ) The overall reason for the amendment: The primary reason for the amendment is to add aSubsequent Therapy Phase in which eligible subjects who progressed after completing the Treatment Phase with either ibrutinib plus venetoclax (I+VEN ; Treatment Arm A)or obinutuzumab plus chloramb ucil (G-Clb; Treatment Arm B) can receive single -agent ibrutinib . Response data ,as well as biomarker samples ,will be collected to evaluate the efficacy of subsequent single -agent ibrutinib therapy in subjects previously treated with a fixed -duration of I+VEN . Applicable Section(s) Description of Change(s) Rationale: ASubsequent Therapy Phase was added in which eligible subjects will be treated continuously with single -agent ibrutinib."

Secondary Objectives Key secondary objectives are to evaluate the following: rate of minimal residual disease (MRD )-negative remissions; overall response rate (ORR), including complete response (CR) rate, and response duration as assessed by an IRC; overall survival (OS); time-to-next treatment ; trough levels of ibrutinib and venetoclax when given in combination ;and safety . Hypothesis Treatment with the combination of I+VEN will result in longer PFS compared with G-Clb in subjects with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL). OVERVIEW OF STUDY DESIGN This is a randomized (1:1),open -label, multicenter, Phase 3 study to determine the efficacy and safety of the combination of I+VEN, compared with G-Clb, in approximately 200subjects with previously untreated CLL/SLL who meet the International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL ) treatment criteria. Randomization will be stratified b y immunoglobulin heavy -chain variable region (IGHV )gene mutational status (mutated vs. unmutated vs. not available) andpresence of deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11 ([del11q] yes vs. no).Subjects with confirmed disease progression after I+VEN or G-Clb may be eligible for and choose to receive subsequen t therapy with single -agent ibrutini b during the Subsequent Therapy Phase . Subject participation will include a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase (fixed -duration Treatment ArmA [I+VEN] or Treatment Arm B [G-Clb]) , and a Follow -up Phase. Subjects from either treatment arm who subsequently develop IRC-confirmed progressive disease and have active disease requiring treatment may be eligible to receive single -agent ibrutinib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity as part of the Subsequent Therapy Phase . Participation in this phase of the study is not mandatory and is based on investigator’s discretion. Study end is defined as approximately 5years after the last subject is randomized into the study or after 50% of subjects have died , whichever occurs first . SUBJECT POPULATION Key eligibility criteria include the following: ≥65 years of age, or,18 to 64 years of ageandhave at least 1of the following ,a CIRSscore >6or creatinine clearance (CrCl) <70mL/min ; active disease status per the iwCLL criteria with measurable nodal disease by CT;and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG )Performance Status (PS) grade of 0, 1,or 2.Subjects with deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del17p) or known TP53 mutations are excluded . DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Subjects random ly assigned to Treatment Arm A (I+VEN) will receive ibrutinib (420 mg/day orally) given aslead-in treatment for 3 cycles. Starting at Cycle 4, venetoclax dose ramp -up (from 20mg to"

Subjects randomly assigned to Treatment Arm B (G-Clb) will receive G-Clb for 6cycles .Obinutuzumab will be administered intravenously at a dose of 1000 mg on Days 1, 8 and 15 in Cycle 1. I n Cycles 2 to 6, 1000 mg obinutuzumab will be given on Day 1. Chlorambucil will be administered orally at a dose of 0.5mg/kg body weight, on Days 1 and 15 of Cycles 1 to 6. A cycle will be defined as 28 days. Subjects in the Subsequent Therapy Phase will receive continuous ibrutinib (420 mg/day orally) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . EVALUATIONS Efficacy evaluations will include imaging, physical examination s, evaluation of blood and bone marrow, disease -related symptoms , and assessment of patient -reported outcomes (PRO ).Safety evaluations will include AEmonitoring, physical examinations, labora tory tests , and review of concomitant medications. To better understand the molecular and protein markers associated with response to and relapse following study treatment , bone marrow and peripheral blood samples will be collected . For subjects assigned t o the I+VEN treatment arm, sparse samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis. STATISTICAL METHODS The primary efficacy endpoint of PFS will be determined by an IRC. The study is designed to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.5 for the I+VEN group relative to G-Clb group (corresponding to an im provement of 100% in median PFS [eg,from 27 months to 54 months ]) with 80% power at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the PFS for each treatment group , and the stratified log-rank test will be used to compare the PFS. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review safety data periodically."

Chronic Ly mphoc ytic Leukemia CLLand SLLare characterized by a spectrum ofclinical manifestations, ranging from indolent disease requir ingno treatment for decades, to markedl y aggressive disease that requires urgent intervention.8,25The International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocy tic Leukemia (iwCLL) developed guidelines to define the clinical context by which treatment should be initiated. These include progressive marrow failure (manifested by anemia or thrombocy topenia or both); massive or progressive splenomegaly ; massive lymphadenopathy ; progressive lymphocy tosis with a rapid lymphocyte doubling time; worsening autoimmune cytopenias; or significant constitutional symptoms.28Throughout this protocol, use of the term “CLL” refers to CLL and SLL. The term ""sponsor"" used throughout this document refers to the entitie s listed in the Contact Information page(s), which will be provided as a separate document. 1.2. Treatment of Chronic Ly mphocy tic Leukemia The type and intensit y of initial therapy is guided by multiple factors .Patient age;presence or absence of comorbidities ;and clinical or molecular disease risk features are foremost among them. Current treatment guidelines from the European Societ y forMedical Oncology (ESMO) indicate thatthe choice of treatment for patients with previously untreated CLL should be based on the stage of disease, whether a patient is considered fit,and the presence or absence of deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del17p) or TP53 mutation.15,18Given the median age at diagnosis and first treatment of CLL, man y patients fall into the “less fit” category . For patien ts who are less fit due to comorbidities and have CLL without del17p or TP53 mutation, single -agent ibrutinib, or chlorambucil in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab, ofatumumab, or obinutuzumab) are the recommended frontline treatment option s.16 Data from randomized controlled clinical studies have shown that the addition of a newer anti-CD20 antibod y,such as obinutuzumab, or ofatumumab ,to chlorambucil provides improvement in median progression -free survival (PFS) compared with chlorambucil alone or rituximab plus chlorambucil.24,33Median PFS after treatment with obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil (G-Clb) was 26.7 months, while median survival was not reached.23Overall response was 77% with a 22% complete response (CR)/complete response with an incomplete marrow recovery (CRi) rate. MRD-negative remissions, defined as detection of <1CLL cell in 10,000 normal leukocy tes by either polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay or flow cytometry , were reported for 41% and 19% of the subjects with CR/CRi in peripheral blood and bone marrow, respectivel y.21Anti-CD20 therap yadministered in combination with cytotoxic chemotherap y to patients with CLL isoften associated with increased r ates of severe neutropenia (26% to 35%), or Grade 3 or higher infusion reactions (7% to 9% for rituximab, 10% for ofatumumab, 21% for obinutuzumab ).22,33,46"
30,page_30,"JNJ-54179060 (ibrutinib) Clinical Protocol 54179060CLL3011 Amendment 4 31 Approved , Date: 19 December 2019Ibrutinib is approved for the treatment of CLL (including del17p CLL). In the Phase 3 RESONATE -2 study (PCYC -1115 -CA)of first-line treatment of older patients with CLL, single -agent ibrutinib resulted in superior PFS (HR=0 .16; P<0.001), OS(HR=0.16, p=0.0010) and ORR (86% vs. 35%, p<0.001) compared with chlorambucil.3Adverse events (AEs) of any grade that occurred in at least 20% of the patients receiving ibrutinib included diarrhea, fatigue, cough, and nausea, and were mainly Grade 1 -2. At median follow -up of 18.4 months, 87% of the patients in the ibrutinib group continued on therapy .3Responses with single -agent ibrutinib are most often partial, a lthough with longer follow -up, the quality of response improves and a higher rate of CR is achieved.4Resolution of adenopathy is usuall y rapid, with efflux of cells into the blood, resulting in a transient ly mphocy tosis. These ly mphocy tes are composed of quiescent cells with inhibited signaling, activation and proliferation . This earlylymphocy tosis doesnot represent treatment failure.30Ibrutinib treatment also is associated with rapid clearance of the disease from the spleen, and to a lesser extent, from the bone marrow , resulti ng in an overall reduction in tumor burden.19,31,56 For patients with active disease and who are considered “fit”, the combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) i s the standard first -line therapy . In a randomized study , CR was reported in 44% of patients treated with FCR and median PFS was approximately 5years.20,29MRD -negative remissions have been reported after FCR treatment, with rates of approximately 40%-60% in peripheral blood and 30% in bone marrow in the total population. Undetectable -MRD has been shown to correlate with longer PFS and OSin FCR -treated patients.2,51MRD -negative remissions occur less frequentl y in patients with CLL with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy -chain variable region (IGHV )or del17p/ TP53 mutations. Toxicity limits the use of FCR in older patients or those with comorbid conditions.52For older but fit patients, bendamustine plus rit uximab is also an option, although efficacy is lower than with FCR.14,15 For patients with del17p or TP53 mutations, the recommended therapy is ibrutinib. Idelalisib plus rituximab or venetoclax are also options if the patient is not suitable for ibrutinib or alternative therapies . Chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) regimens tend to show limited efficacy in patients with del17p/ TP53 mutation, whereas the newer B-cell receptor (BCR) -targeted therapies have demonstrated efficacy across poor prognostic groups.37,57 1.3. Ibrutinib Ibrutinib (IMBRUVICA®) is anorally administered, covalently -binding inhibitor ofBruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK )co-developed by Pharmacy clics LLC ,an AbbVie Company ,and Janssen Research & Development LL C for the treatment of B -cell malignancies. I t has been approved for use inmany regions, including the United States (US) and European Union (EU) .There are currentl y a number ofindications approved, including for thetreatment of patients with CLL, including CLL with del17p, patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have received at least 1prior therap y, patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, patients with marginal zone lymphoma who require systemic therapy and have received at least one prior anti-CD20 -based therap y, and adult patients with chronic graft versus host disease following the failure of 1 or more lines of s ystemic therap y."

Unanticipated side effects that have not been previously observed may occur. 1.4. Venetoclax Venetoclax is an oral inhibitor of B-cell lymphoma -2(BCL -2),an anti-apoptotic protein. Overexpression of BCL -2 has been demonstrated in CLL cells where it mediates tumor cell survival and has been associated with resistance to chemotherap y. The approved indications include the use of venetoclax monotherapy for the treatment of CLL in the presence of del17por TP53 mutation in adult patients who are unsuitable for or have failed a BCR pathway inhibitor, and for the treatment of CLL in the absence of del17por TP53 mutation in adult patients who have failed both CIT and a BCR pathway inhibitor. I t is currently in development in combination with immunotherapy (rituximab or obinutuzumab) for the treatment of the broad population of relapsed/refractory CLL, as well as frontline CLL."
34,page_34,"JNJ-54179060 (ibrutinib) Clinical Protocol 54179060CLL3011 Amendment 4 35 Approved , Date: 19 December 2019In a Phase 1 study in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL (n=116), venetoclax treatment resulted in a 79% ORR, with a 20% rate of CR/CRi. Of the subjects with CR/CRi, 35% of those with available samples were shown to be MRD -negative in the bone marrow (5% of total population). Adverse events included mild diarrhea (in 52% of the patients), upper respiratory tract infection (48%), nausea (47%), and Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (41%).47Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an important identified risk when initiating venetoclax. In the initial Phase 1 dose-finding studies, which had a short titration phase and higher starting dose, the incidence of TLS was 13% and includ ed2 fatal events and 3 events of acute renal failure. However, the risk of TLS was reduced to 3% after revision of the dosing regimen and modification to prophy laxis and monitoring measures.54In a Phase 2 study in relapsed patients with the poor prognostic cytogenetic abnormality , del17p (n=10 7), a 79% ORR and 8% CR/CRi rate were observed.50The MRD -negative CR rate was 3%.53 1.5. Ibrutinib in Combination with Venetoclax in CLL Ibrutinib and venetoclax have complementary mechanisms of action target ingdistinct B-cell pathway s involved in the propagation of CLL cells. Ibrutinib arrests CLL cell proliferation . Venetoclax is pro-apoptotic and induces early cell death.11,42Ibrutinib also affects the adhesion and migration of CLL cells resulting in rapid efflux of CLL cells from tissue compartments, especiall y lymph node and spleen, into the peripheral blood. Venetoclax treatment results in effective clearance of the blood a nd bone marrow , but residual disease can be observed in lymph nodes. Together the 2 drugs are expected to provide complementary and effective clearance of disease from all compartments. Preclinical studies evaluating CLL patient samples have demonstrated asurge in cellular apoptosis with concomitant inhibition of BTK and BCL -2 suggesting that the combination of ibrutinib plus venetoclax (I+VEN) is synergistic.6,42A high-throughput screen combining ibrutinib with a number of novel agents revealed venetoclax to be the most synergistic combinati on partner across several B-cell malignancies .48In a study to evaluate samples from patients treated with ibrutinib monotherapy to explore drugs that may have a synergistic effect with ibrutinib in facilitating cell death, venetoclax had the most potent cell killing. Ibrutinib decreased levels of myeloid cell leukemia 1, an anti-apoptotic protein, which is thought to explain, in part, the greater apoptosis seen with venetoclax when given in combination .6 Furthermore, ibrutinib treatment may generate overexpression of BCL -2 which increases cell sensitivity to venetoclax.10,17This induction of CLL cell dependence on BCL -2 further supports synergy in concomitant use of venetoclax with ibrutinib. I n a T-cell leukemia -1 adoptive transfer mouse model of CLL, the combi nation of I+VEN result edin a more complete and durable response compared with either of the single agent salone .49Early clinical data from an ongoing , investigator -initiated study of the combination of I+VEN in patients with high-risk relapsed/refracto ry CLL (CLARITY Study ) indicate that the combination is highly effective, with rapid clearance of disease and acceptable tolerability .32,34In this study , patients are treated with ibru tinib for 8 weeks before venetoclax is started with the recommended 5 -week ramp -up to 400mg/day . Treatment will continue for a period of 14 to 26months, depending on MRD -negative status. Among the first 35patients who have received 4monthsof therapy (including 8 weeks of the combination I+VEN) a rapid reduction in CLL cells in the peripheral"
35,page_35,"JNJ-54179060 (ibrutinib) Clinical Protocol 54179060CLL3011 Amendment 4 36 Approved , Date: 19 December 2019blood was observed , (median 3-log reduction ). All 25patients who have reached their 8-month response assessments (including 6 months of I+VEN) have had an objective response :15/25 (60%) achieved CR or CRi and 7/25 (28%) have achieved an MRD -negative remission in bone marrow . Tolerability was generally reported as good, with most AEs being Grade 1 or 2. There was asingle case of Grade 3 asymptomatic TLS.32More recent data as of December 2018 show that after 12 months of combined therapy (I+VEN), all patients have responded and 23/40 (58%) have achieved a complete remission. In addition, 27/31 (87%) had no morphological evidence of CLL in the bone marrow biopsy and 32/34 (94%) had less than 1% CLL cells in the bone marrow aspirate. Undetectable -MRD (ie <0.01%) was achieved in 23/40 (58%) patients in the peripheral blood and in 17/41 (41%) in the bone marrow.35 Another investigator -initiated study is evaluating the combination of I+VEN in subjects with relapsed/refractory CLL and in treatme nt-naïve subjects with CLL with at least 1 of the following high-risk features: del17p, mutated TP53 , deletion of the long arm ofchromosome 11, unmutated IGHV , or ≥65 years of age.38Subjects were treated with single -agent ibrutinib for 3months, followed by addition ofvenetoclax with a weekl y dose escalation to the target dose of 400mg daily. The primary endpoint israte ofCR/CRi .With a median follow -up of 7.5 months (range, 0.6-12.1 months), 61 subjects have completed treatment with single -agent ibrutinib and begun the combination with I+VEN . Three months of single -agent ibrutinib therap y reduced the TLS risk category for venetoclax treatment in 51% of subjects (ie,TLS risk decreased from high-or medium -risk categories to medium -or low-risk). In the 14subjects with relapsed/refractory CLL who have completed at least 3 months of combination therap y, 100% had a response (9CR/CRi, 5partial response [PR]). In the 16 subjects with treatment -naïve, high-risk CLL who completed at least 3 months of the combination, 100% had a response (9CR/CRi, 7PR). Across both cohorts, 6subjects were MRD -negative by Month 9.No unexpected AEs were observed. Grade 3-4 neutropenia and Grade 3-4 thrombocy topenia were reported in 44% and 4% of subjects, respectivel y.There was 1 case of asymptomatic TLS, and no cases of clinical TLS.38Recently reported results involving the treatment -naïve cohort show that at 6 months of the combination treatment, 24/34 (71%) patients achieved CR/CRi and 14/34 (41%) achieved bone marrow undetectable -MRD remission. After 12 months of the combination, 23/25 (92%) of the patients were in CR/CRi with 17/25 (68%) achieving bone marrow undetectable -MRD remission.39 Study PCYC -1142 -CA is an ongoing multicenter, Phase 2 study in subjects with treatment -naïve CLL. Treatment consists of open -label I+VEN for approximately 15 months .Subjects who attain MRD -negative status at Month 15 are randomized in a double -blind fashion to receive continuous treatment with ibrutinib or placebo until MRD -positivity , disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity . In the initial safety run-in of the study , a 3-month lead-in of single -agent ibrutinib befor e adding the venetoclax per standard dose ramp -up schedule, was tested in 14patients. No TLS wasobserved during the initial safet y run-in. Early data presented after 163patients were enrolled showed an ORR of 100% in the 14 safet y run-in patients (1/14 confirmed CR and 13/14 PR). Nine of 11 assessed patients had MRD -negative status in peripheral blood. Adverse events occurring in ≥20% of I+VENexposed subjects included diarrhea (39%), fatigue (23%), nausea (23%), and arthralgia (21%). Grade 3 or higher AEs that"

No clinical TL S was observed in this phase of the study .56 Based on preliminary data from the same study, venetoclax exposure (AUC) at 400mg once daily appears to be approximatel y 1.7-fold higher with 420 mg ibrutinib (CLL, N=32) compared to venetoclax single -agent 400mg daily exposure. Within the same dataset, ibrutinib exposures when dosed in combination with venetoclax were comparable to that observed at 420mg of ibrutinib asa single agent. To date, no new safet y signals have been identified, and investigators are advised to monitor subjects closel y for signs of toxicity . 1.6. Overall Rationale for the Study This study is designed to evaluate whether the combination I+VEN will result in superior efficacy following a fixed duration of drug administration, compared with the combination G-Clb, in the first-line treatment of subjects with CLL. Obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil, given for the standard duration of 6 months , is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated CLL and comorbidities that make them unsuitable for fludarabine -based therapy . Obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil was chosen as the comparator for this study based on its efficacy and safet y. It is a standard of care given with fixed duration and is recommended by both US and EU treatment guidelines for use in this patient population.15,16,18,40 As single agents, b oth ibrutinib and venetoclax have demonstrated efficacy and acceptable safet y for the treatment of patients with CLL. The combination of I+VEN was chosen based on complementary mechanisms of action of the drugs , preclinical synergistic activity ,and promising early clinical data as described in Section 1.5. In the frontline treatment of CLL, ibrutinib monotherapy has demonstrated significant PFS and OS advantages compared with chlorambucil .However, CRoccur sin approximately 20% of patients an d undetectable -MRD has been reported rarely.1,3Continuous therap y has been considered necessary to maintain the benefit of ibrutinib therap y,andcontinuous therap yis associated with increasing depth of response over time. Although ibrutinib has demonstrated efficacy and tolerability advantages in frontline treatment , some patients and physicians prefer fixed -duration alternatives, such as chlorambucil plus obinutuzumab, as their initial therap y to avoid long-term treatment . The strategy of combining ibrutini b with venetoclax is anticipated to result in higher rates of disease clearance in all body compartments asreflected by robust MRD -negativity and durable responses thus allowing discontinuation of therap y following a defined period of treatment. Developme nt of the I+VEN regimen could provide patients with an effective alternative dosing option to continuous ibrutinib therapy andtheclarity of knowing the length of their treatment period. Treating for a fixed duration , rather than until progression, may also preserve sensitivity to ibrutinib and venetoclax and allow for retreatment with either agent at the time ofrelapse .To investigate this, subjects who relapse or progress after first-line treatment with fixed -duration I+VEN (Treatment Arm A) may receive continuous single -agent ibrutinib ,if eligible , in the Subsequent Therap yPhase ."
37,page_37,"JNJ-54179060 (ibrutinib) Clinical Protocol 54179060CLL3011 Amendment 4 38 Approved , Date: 19 December 2019During the Treatment Phase, subjects in this study will receive ibrutinib for 15cycles (1cycle=28days). Venetoclax dose ramp up will begin at Cy cle 4 and treatment with venetoclax will continue for 12 cycles (seeSection 6.1).The rationale for the lead-in treatment with ibrutinib is to minimize the risk of TLS reported with venetoclax. TLS is a well-described phenomenon associated with treatment with venetoclax. Recent anal ysis of data from 3 studies of single -agent ibrutinib in relapsed/refractory and treatment -naïve CLL (N=424) demonstrated that the majority of patients who were at high risk for TLS at baseline on the basis of lymph node bulk and absolute ly mphocy te count ( ALC )were reduced to medium -or low -risk TL S categories within approximately 2to 4months of ibrutinib treatment.55The approach of treating with single -agent ibrutinib prior to commencing treatment with venetoclax has been utilized in the ongoing Phase 2 studi es of I+VEN described previously and appears to be successful in reducing TLS risk. In the Subsequent Therapy Phase, eligible subjects initially treated with either I+VEN or G-Clb will receive single -agent ibrutinib until disease progression or unacceptab le toxicity . Subjects who initially responded to fixed -duration treatment with I +VEN are expected to retain sensitivity to ibrutinib , supporting the use of the same agent after disease relapse. For subjects previousl y treated with G-Clb, single -agent ibrutinib is an appropriate and approved second -line treatment option. The population of subjects selected for this study are those considered suitable for treatment with the comparator, obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil , ie,adult patients with previously untreated CLL and comorbidities that make them unsuitable for fludarabine -based therap y. Subjects with del17p or known TP53 mutation are excluded because chlorambucil plus CD20 antibody is not recommended therapy for such patients per ESMO guidelines. Subjects will be stratified based on IGHVmutational status and presence of del11q , as theseareknown prognostic factor sfor efficacy outcomes in the treatment of CLL."

Overview of Study Design This is a randomized, open -label, multicenter, Phase 3 study to determine the efficacy and safety of the combination of I+VEN, compared with G-Clb, administered to subjects with previously untreated CLL who meet the iwCLL treatment criteria. Approximately 200 subjects will be randoml y assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either Treatment Arm A (I+VEN) or Treatment Arm B (G-Clb). Stratification factors will include the IGHV mutational status (mutated vs. unmutated vs. not available )and presence of deletion of the long arm of chromosome 11 ([del11q] y es vs. no) . Subjects randomly assigned to Treatment Arm A (I+VEN) will receive ibrutinib for 15cycles (1cycle=28days), starting with 3 cycles of ibrutinib monotherapy . Venetoclax dose ramp-up will begin at Cy cle 4 .The combination of I+VEN will be given for 12 cycles (through C ycle 15). Subjects randomly assigned to Treatment Arm B (G-Clb) will receive G-Clb for 6cycles. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)for safet y review will be formed and constituted according to regulatory agenc y guidelines (see Section 11.9).Subjects who are eligible and choose to participate in the Subsequent Therap y Phase will receive subsequent single -agent ibrutinib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity . Subject participation will include a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, and a Follow -up Phase. The Screening Phase will be fora period of30 days before randomization. The Treatment Phase will extend from randomization until study treatment discontinuation from fixed -duration treatment with I+VEN or G-Clb. The Follow -up Phase will begin once a subject discontinues treatment. Subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression in Treatment Phase will continue to have disease evaluations (DEs) according toTable 3.Subjects from either treatment arm who subsequently develop IRC-confirmed PDand have active disease requiring treatment may be eligible to receive single -agent ibrutinib given until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity as part of the Subsequent Therapy Phase. Participation in this phase of the study is not mandatory and is based on investigator ’sdiscretion. The Follow -up Phase will continue until death, lostto follow -up, consent withdrawal, or study end, whichever occurs first. Subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression in the Subsequent Therap yPhase will continue to have DEs according to Table 4. The primary analysis and reporting of the study will be conducted after 71PFS events have been observed after randomization . Study end is defined as approximately 5years after the last subject is randomized into the study or after 50% of the subjects have died, whichever comes first. Subjects receiving single -agent ibrutinib in the Subsequent Therapy Phase may be offered participation in a separate study on or before the end of the current study to ensure continuit y of ibrutinib therapy ."

The primary efficacy analysis of PFS will be based on the IRC assessment of PDin the intent -to-treat (ITT)population . Patient -reported health outcomes , functional status, and well -being will also be measured. During the study , safety evaluations will include AE monitoring, physical examinations, review of concomitant medications, and evaluation of clinical laboratory parameters (hematology and chemistry ). At each si te visit, subjects will be assessed for toxicity . Blood samples will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (Treatment Arm A only) and biomarker studies. All study evaluations will be conducted per the Time and Events Schedule that corresponds to the assigned treatm ent arm (Table 1for Treatment Arm A,Table 2for Treatment Arm B, Table 3for DEs, andTable 4for the Subsequent Therap yPhase ). 3.2. Study Design Rationale This is a Phase 3, rando mized study evaluating the combination I+VEN compared with the standard of care G-Clb, in the first-line treatment of subjects with CLL. The study will recruit subject s globally and is adequatel y powered to demonstrate an improvement in PFS with the I+VEN combination over the standard of care. This study design is widely employ ed to obtain data to support regulatory applications for new treatments. Randomization will be used to minimize bias in the assignment of subjects to treatment groups, to increase thelikelihood that known and unknown subject attributes (eg,demographic and baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced across treatment groups, and to enhance the validity of statistical comparisons across treatment groups. Subjects will be stratified byIGHV mutational status (mutated vs. unmutated vs. not available ), a well-defined prognostic indicator for patients with CLL , and presence of del11q (y es vs. no) . The primary endpoint for the Phase 3 Study CLL3011 is independently reviewed PFS using the 2008iwCLLguidelines , including recent clarifications .26,27Demonstration of an improvement in PFS is viewed as a clinical benefit and an acceptable primary endpoint for CLL. As such, it has served as the basis for regulatory approvals in CLL. The keysecondary endpoints for this study include rate of MRD -negative remissions in the bone marrow , ORR, OS, and safet y of the combination. The endpoints of rate of MRD -negative remission, ORR, and OS are well-defined and recommended endpoints for the evaluati on of new treatments for CLL . Thetrial involves a novel combination regimen given at a finite duration. Treatment with I+VEN is anticipated tolead to a lower rate of clonal evolution and resistance mutations. For this reason, blood and bone marrow sampl es will be collected at baseline and other prespecified timepoints to explore biomarkers predictive of response to and relapse following study treatment . Subjects from either treatment arm who progress after I+VEN or G-Clb may become eligible to receive single -agent ibrutinib in the Subsequent Therap yPhase . Response data,as well as biomarker samples ,will be collected to evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib in subjects previously treated with I+VEN in a subsequent pooled a nalysis."

The subject should not take extra capsu les to make up the missed dose. At any given visit, sufficient study medication required for treatment until the next visit should be dispensed. Unused study medication dispensed during previous visits must be returned and drug accountability records will be updated. Returned capsules cannot be re-used in this study or outside the study . Study staff will instruct subjects on how to store medication for at -home use as indicated for this protocol. 6.1.1.2. Ibrutinib Dose Modification Treatment with ibrutinib should be temporarily stopped for unmanageable, potentiall y ibrutinib -related toxicity that is Grade ≥3 in severity . Ibrutinib may be temporaril y stopped for a maximum of 28 consecutive day s. Ibrutinib should be discontinued perman ently in the event of a toxicity lasting more than 28 day s, unless continued treatment is approved by the sponsor . The dose of ibrutinib must be modified according to the dose modification guidance in Table 7if any of the following potentially drug -related toxicities occur: ANC <500 cells/µL for more than 7 days. See Section 8.1for instructions regarding the use of growth factor support. Platelets <50,000 cells/µLin the presence of clinically significant bleeding . Platelets <25,000 cells/µL. Grade 3 nausea or Grade 3 or 4vomiting or Grad e 3 or 4 diarrhea, if persistent despite optimal anti -emetic or anti -diarrheal therap y. Any other Grade 4 or unmanageable Grade 3 toxicity . If the dose of ibrutinib is reduced, the dose of ibrutinib may be re-escalated at investigator’s discretion after 2 dose-reduced cycles in the absence of a recurrence of the toxicity that led to the reduction. No dose escalation of ibrutinib above 420mg is allowed in this study . Dose changes must be recorded in the Dose Administration electronic case report for m (eCRF )."

For example, if an AE occurs and is considered related to venetoclax but not ibrutinib, the dose of venetoclax should be modified while ibrutinib should remain the same. If the AE is considered potentially related to both drugs, adjusting the dose of venetoclax before ibrutinib is the recommended first action,taking into consideration the possibility of higher systemic exposure of venetoclax when administered in combination with ibrutinib . For cases where the investigator is uncertain of what action to take, the study monitor may be contacted for further discussion. If ibrutinib is discontinued for toxicity , then treatment with venetoclax may be continued. 6.1.1.2.1. Ibrutinib Dose Modification for Subjects With Hepatic Impairment Ibrutinib is metabolized in the liver. Therefore ,subjects with clinically significant hepatic impairment at the time of screening (Child -Pugh Class B or C) are excluded from study participation. For subjects who develop mild liver impairment while on study (Child -Pugh Class A), the recommended dose reduction for ibrutinib is to a level of 280 mg daily. For subjects who develop moderate liver impairment while on study (Child -Pugh Class B), the recommended dose reduction is to a level of 140 mg daily. For subjects who develop severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class C), ibrutinib must be held until resolved to moderate impairment (Child -Pugh Class B) or better. Monitor subjects for signs of toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed (see Attachment 4for Child -Pugh classificati on). 6.1.2.

Dosage and Adminis tration Venetoclax tablets should be taken orall y once daily with a meal and water around the same time each day. Venetoclax tablets should be swallowed whole and not chewed, crushed, or broken prior to swallowing. During cycles with ibrutinib combination dosing, ibrutinib and venetoclax should be taken together at the same time. I f a subject misses a dose of venetoclax within 8 hours of the time it is usuall y taken, the subject should take the missed dose as soon as possible on the same day. If a subject misses a dose of venetoclax by more than 8 hours, the subject should not take the missed dose and should resume the usual dosing schedule the following day .If a subject vomits following dosing, no additional dose should be taken that day.The next prescr ibed dose should be taken at the usual time the following day. The starting dose is 20mg of venetoclax once daily for 7 days. The dose must be graduall y increased over a period of 5 weeks up to the recommended daily dose of 400 mg as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3: Venetoclax Dose Ramp -up The 5-week dose-titration schedule is designed to graduall y reduce tumor burden (debulk) and decrease the risk of TL S. The first dose of venetoclax will be delivered in the clinic (or in the hospital depending on TLSrisk category ) on Cycle 4 Day 1. Dose escalation will occur in accordance with specific risk-based TLS proph ylaxis and monitorin g measures that may include dose delay sor dose reduction s. After completion of the 5-week dose ramp -up, subsequent dosing is typically continued on an outpatient basis."

Prophy laxis and Management of Tumor Lysis Sy ndrome Venetoclax may cause arapid reduction in tumor burden and thus poses a risk for TLS in the initial 5-week ramp -up phase. Changes in electroly tes consistent with TLS that require prompt management may occur as earl y as 6 to 8 hours following the first dose of venetoclax and at each dose increase. The risk of TL S is a continuum based on multiple factors, including tumor burden and comorbidities (Table 8). Subjects with high tumor burden are at a greater risk of TLS when initiating venetoclax. Reduced renal function further increases the risk. The risk may decrease as tumor burden decreases with treatment. Prior to initiating venetoclax, tumor burden assessment, including radio graphic evaluation (eg,CTscan), must be performed for all subjects. Blood chemistry (potassium, uric acid, phosphorus, calcium, and creatinine) must be assessed as per theTime and Events Schedules and pre-existing abnormalities must be corrected. The proph ylaxis measures listed below must be followed. More intensive measures should be employ ed as risk increases. In all subjects, assess subject -specific factors for level of risk of TLS and provide prophy lactic hydration and anti-hyperuricemics to subjects prior to the first dose of venetoclax to reduce the risk of TLS. Employ more intensive measures (intravenous hydration, frequent monit oring, and hospitalization) as risk increases. Subjects with baseline CrCl ≤50mL/min or with high risk for TLS as defined by at least one lesion ≥10cm,or at least one lesion ≥5cm plus circulating lymphocytes >25,000 cells/µL , should be hospitalized during the first 24to 48 hours of treatment with 20mg and 50mg of venetoclax for TLS monitoring and intravenous hydration. Hospitalization should be considered for subjects who are at low or medium risk of TLS if they do not have immediate access to a facility capable of correcting TL Spromptly ,or are otherwise considered at risk for TL S."

STUDY EVA LUATIONS 9.1. Study Procedures 9.1.1. Overview The study is divided into a Screening Phase, aTreatment Phase (Treatment Arm A [I+VEN]) or Treatment Arm B [G-Clb]), and a Follow -up Phase. Eligible subjects may also participate in a Subsequent Therap yPhase .The Time and Events Schedules (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3and Table 4) summarize the frequency and timing of efficacy , PRO , biomarker, and safet y measurements applicable to this study . All visit-specific PRO assessments should be conducted before any tests, procedures, or other consultations for that visit,to prevent influencing subject perceptions. PRO assessments will be captured electronically . Adverse event information will be collected using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) Version 4.03. A separate toxicity scale (iwCLL grading scale for hematological toxicity in CLL studies) should be used to assess the severit y of c ytopenias (ie, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocy topenia, see Table 14). Additional serum or urine pregnancy tests may be performed, as necessary ,or as required by local regulation, to establish the absence of pregnancy at any time during the subject's partici pation in the study . For each subject, the maximum amount of blood drawn will not normally exceed that typicall y required for medical management of this patient population. Repeat or unscheduled blood sampling may be taken for safet y reasons or technical i ssues . 9.1.2. Screening Phase Screening procedures will be performed up to 30 days before randomization. All subjects must sign an ICFprior to the conduct of any study -related procedures. During the Screening Phase, eligibility criteria will be reviewed and a complete clinical evaluation will be performed as specified in the respective Time and Events Schedules . This evaluation will include a complete medica l history , confirmation of CLL diagnosis, staging at study entry (Attachment 10), and laboratory tests. Pathology reports, including fluorescence insitu hybridization (FISH )analysis for del17p and del11q , will be collected for sponsor review. Subjects with known presence of TP53 mutations detected at a threshold of 10% VAF will be excluded from the study .40Results"

The collection of AEs and concomitant medications will commence after the study informed consent is signed. For women of childbearing potential, a urine or serum β-hCG pregnancy test will be performed. Clinical assessments performed as part of the subject’s routine clinical evaluation and not specifically for this study need not be repeated after signed informed consent has been obtained provided the assessments fulfil l the study requirements and are performed within the specified timeframe prior to randomization. Evaluation for disease -related symptoms, a full physical examination, a complete blood count (CBC), and CT scans (or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI ; Section 9.2.1.1 ]) are anticipated components of DE. Results of radiologic assessments obtained prior to signing the informed consent may be used if perform ed within 60days of randomization, if the Imaging Acquisition Guidelines standards are met. Subsequent radiologic assessments performed throughout the study must be of the same modality as performed during screening. A bone marrow evaluation is required, preferabl y within 30days of randomization; however, results within 90days of randomization are acceptable. Bone marrow biopsies should be evaluated locally for morphology . Bone marrow aspirate or peripheral blood may be used to assess the subject ’s cytogenetic profile using standard CLL FISH probes to detect abnormalities in chromosomes 17, 13, 12, and 11. In addition, immunophenoty ping should be performed on the aspirate or blood sample. Results will be collected in the eCRF. For subjects with SLL, a lymph node biops y may be used for immunophenoty ping, morphology , and FI SH testing. For subjects undergoing a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate during the screening, a sample of the aspirate and biopsy should be collected for biomarker assay s and MRD testing. Archived bone marrow slides for biomarkers are acceptable. 9.1.3. Open -label Treatment Phase The Treatment Phase will begin at randomization and will continue until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity , or other reasons as described in Section 10. Subjects should start study treatment within 72 hours after randomization. The results of laboratory testing taken on Cy cle1 Day 1 of study treatment will be defined as the baseline values for safety assessments and treatment decisions. Laboratory values obtained prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 for the Treatment Phase should be repeated if the blood sample was collected more than 72 hours prior to the anticipated start of study treatment. Test results should satisfy eligibility criteria for treatment to commence. Subjects assigned to I+VEN will receive treatment as outlined in Section 6.1. Treatment begins with 3 cycles ofibrutinib monotherapy . Investigators must request approval from medical monitor to start the venetoclax dose ramp -up phase in Cycle 4 after TLS risk assessment is completed and theappropriate TLS prophy laxis is started (see Table 8). I+VEN combination therap y will be given for 12 cycles. Subjects assigned to G-Clb will receive obinutuzumab infusions as outlined in Section 6.2. G-Clb will be given for 6 cy cles."

Treatment will be dispensed once all predose evaluations have been completed and the investigator has decided that a subject may receive treatment. Instructions for home administration and storage conditions of study treatment should be reviewed. If a subject shows signs of progression on physical examination or laboratory assessment, study treatment may continue until progression is confirmed by additional modalities. If PDis diagnosed, then the subject should discontinue study treatment, complete the End-of-Treatment Visit within 30days (+7-day window) of the last dose of study treatment, and enter the Follow -up Phase. End-of-Treatme nt An End -of-Treatment Visit will be scheduled within 30 day s (+7 -day window) of the last dose of study treatment in the Treatment Phase and in the Subsequent Therap y Phase for all subjects discontinuing treatment for any reason, except for lost to follow -up, death, or withdrawal of consent for study participation. Subjects who discontinue treatment and enter the Follow-up Phase should have the End-of-Treatment Visit completed before starting any subsequent anti-leukemic treatment for CLL. If a subject is unable to return to the site for the End-of-Treatment Visit, then the subject should be contacted to collect AEs that occur within 30days after the last dose of study treatment. Additional information on reporting of AEs is found in Section 12.Refer to the Time and Events Schedules for a complete list of procedures to be performed at the End -of-Treatment Visit. 9.1.4. Follow -up Phase The Follow -up Phase will begin once a subject discontinues treatment. Subjects who discontinue treatment for reasons other than disease progression will continue to have DEs as outlined in the Time and Events Schedule (Table 3).These subjects will also be followed for survival status. Following disease progression, contact will be made every 24 weeks ± 7 daysuntil study end to determine: Subsequent anti-leukemic therap y CLL treatment criteria supporting i nitiation of subsequent therap y Occurrence of new malignancy PRO score (EQ -5D-5L only for the first 2 post -PD visits ) Transformation to a more aggressive histology (Richter’s transformation) Survival status. The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will be administered as shown in the Time and Events Schedules .

A subject who progresses on therap y with single -agent ibrut inib during the Subsequent Therap y Phase may re-enter the Follow -up Phase. It is important for survival status to be assessed and the date of death documented for each randomized subject, regardless of whether the subject received study treatment. I f infor mation on survival status and subsequent therap y is obtained via telephone contact, then written documentation of the communication must be available for review in source documents. If a subject die s, then the date and cause of death are to be reported in the appropriate eCRF. 9.1.5. Subsequent Therapy Phase Before a subject is considered for inclusion in the Subsequent Therap y Phase, the investigator is expected to re-review the informed consent with the subject to ensure that he or she understands the purpose of,as well as the study procedures and required visits associated with,the Subsequent Therap y Phase . Theeligibility criteria described in Section 9.1.5.1 will be reviewed and a clinical evaluation will be performed, including medical history review, staging (Attachment 10),andlaboratory tests (including FISH analysis for del17p, del11q, del13q, and trisomy 12 for sponsor review; seeTable 4). Imaging is required prior to treatment in the Subsequent Therap y Phase for subjects initially treated with I+VEN (Treatment Arm A ).Results ofCT scans (or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI ; Section 9.2.1.1 ]) obtained within 60 days before start of single -agent ibrutinib treatment can be used, if the Imaging Acquisition Guidelines standards are met. Approval from the medical monitor is required for treatment with single -agent ibrutinib and treatment should be started within 72 hours of approval. The Subsequent Therapy Phase will begin at Cycle 1 Day 1 of treatment with single -agent ibrutinib andwill continue until disease progression, unacceptab le toxicity , or other reasons as described in Section 10.2.The results of laboratory testing obtained of Cycle1 Day 1 of single -agent ibrutinib treatment will be defined as the baseline values for safet y assessments and treatment decisions in the Subsequent Therap y Phase . Laboratory values obtained prior to Cycle1 Day 1 of single -agent ibrutinib should be repeated if the blood sample was collected more than 72 hours prior to the anticipated start of study treatment. Test results should satisfy eligibility criteria for treatment to commence.

Eligibility for the Subsequent Therapy Phase Eligibility for the Subsequent Therap yPhase must be approved by the medical monitor following an assessment of the eligibility parameters described below and a review of relevant inclusion/exclusion criteria for overall study entry in Section 4.1and Section 4.2. Participation in the Subsequent Therap y Phase is not mandatory and is based oninvestigator’s discretion. Inclusion Criteria for Subsequent Therapy wi th Single -agent Ibrutinib Study subjects must satisfy all of the following criteria to be eligible to receive single -agent ibrutinib and enter the Subsequent Therap yPhase . 1.Criterion modified per Amendment 4 1.1Complete dthe initial fixed -duration Treatment Phase as described in the protocol . Subjects randomized to Treatment Arm B may remain eligible even if protocol -specified treatment is not completed. 2.Progressive disease confirmed by IRC 3.Exhibit active CLL/SLL requirin g treatment per iwCLL criteria . Exclusion Criteria for Subsequent Therapy with Single -agent Ibrutinib Any potential subject who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participating in the Subsequent Therapy Phase : 1.Any potential subject who has received any subsequent anti-leukemic therap y after the Treatment Phase will be excluded from participating in the Subsequent Therapy Phase . NOTE: Investigators should ensure that all criteria are met. If a subject’s clinical status changes after request for approval of subsequent therapy with single -agent ibrutinib , but before the first dose of study treatment such that he or she no longer meets all eligibility criteria, the subject should be excluded from treatment. 9.2. Efficacy Efficacy evaluations will be conducted as specified in the Time and Events Schedule (Table 3 and Table 4) and will include the following: Disease -related s ymptoms and phy sical exam ination .For disease -related sy mptoms, subjects will be asked about the presence or absence and severit y of fatigue, night sweats, fevers, weight loss, and abdominal discomfort. All post-screening physical examinations should focus on examination of lymph nodes, the liver, and spleen. CBC with AL C. CT scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis."

Collection of bone marrow aspirate for central MRD analy sis by flow cy tometry and NGS should be done in all responders. PROs as measured by the EORTC -QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires, and the FACIT -Fatigue scale . 9.2.1. Evaluations 9.2.1.1. Radiographic Imaging A ssessments Disease response should be assessed using CT scans with IV contrast of the neck (full neck views starting from the base of the skull must be obtained), chest, abdomen, and pelvis. The size of lymph nodes, the liver, and spleen should be evaluated. All imaging shou ld be performed according to the ImagingAcquisition Guidelines (see materials in Section 15). Subjects who cannot tolerate IV contrast may have CT scans performed with oral contrast. If disease progression is suspected from physical examination or laboratory testing, additional modalities must be performed for confirmation. The subject may continue study treatment until disease progression is confirm ed. CT scans should be performed according to the Time and Events Schedule (Table 3and Table 4)until disease progression is confirmed, regardless of whether or not the subject remains on study treatment. In the Subsequent Therap y Phase, CT imaging is expected for subjects who were initially treated with I+VEN (Treatment Arm A). For subjects who were initially treated with G-Clb (Treatment Arm B), imaging is recommended only when clinically indicated and as determined by the investigator. Magnetic resonance imaging may be used to evaluat e sites of disease that cannot be adequately imaged using CT or in exceptional cases where CT scans with IV or oral contrast are contraindicated. However, the imaging modality used must remain consistent from screening through all subsequent DEs. Brain imaging and positron emission tomograph y scans may be done only if clinically indicated. 9.2.1.2. Definition of Measurable and A ssessable Disease Subjects must have at least 1 measurable site of disease (target lesion )to participate in the study .28Measurable sites of disease are defined as lymph nodes or lymph node masses >1.5cm in longest diameter. Measurements must be determined by CT orMRI imaging. Extranodal sites of disease are considered assessable, but not measurable. Up to 6 measurable sites of disease, clearl y measurable in 2 perpendicular dimensions, will be followed for each subject. Measurable sites of disease should represent the extent of the subject’s disease. As much as possible , the selection of target lesions should be from different regions of the body . Additional lesions that are identified by radiologic imaging or physical examination but are not included in the target lesion assessment should be considered as assessable (non-target) lesions and followed throughout the study . Investigators should provide a qualitative assessment of the spleen and liver at screening and in all subsequent DEvisits."

Bone Marrow A ssessments A bone marrow aspirate and biopsy must be obtained during screening or up to 90days before randomization. For subjects undergoing a baseline bone marrow assessment during the screening period, a sample of the bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be collected for biomarker assay s and MRD testing. Archived bone marrow slides for biomarkers are acceptable for patients who are not undergoing bone marrow assessments at screening. Standard CLL testing to assess morphology , immunophenoty ping, and cytogenetic profile (by FISH) should be performed to completely characterize the diagnosis of CLL . A local bone marrow biopsy examination is expected to include morphologic evaluation and immunohistochemistry testing . For subjects with SLL, a lymph node biopsy may be used for similar tests. Instructions for the collection, handling, and shipment of bone marrow samples are outlined in a Laboratory Manual. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy samples are collected from all subjects with response of PR or better at DE3of the Treatment Phase . The bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be sent to a local laboratory for standard evaluation andresponse assessment. An additional bone marrow aspirate sample will be sent to the central laboratory for MRD analy sis (as described in Section 9.2.2 ). At DE6of the Treatment Phase , a central bone marrow aspirate MRD assessment is required in all subjects with a response of PR or better. Bone marrow biopsy and aspirate for local evaluations areonly required for subjects on the I+VEN treatment group who were not confirmed CR at DE3of the Treatment Phase . For subjects with a suspected PD based on new onset cytopenia, a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be obtained to confirm PD locall y. During the Subsequent Therap yPhase ,a bone marrow biopsy is indicated to confirm a CR. Additional bone marrow evaluations may be pursued at the investigator’s discreti on. 9.2.2. Minimal Residual Disease A ssessments An analy tically validated 8-color flow cytometry assay will be used to assess MRD.44Samples will be incub ated with a cocktail of fluorochrome -labeled antibodies. One million viable events will be acquired on the FACSCanto II flow cytometer, and post-acquisition analysis will be performed to determine MRD -negativity . MRD -negativity is defined as <1CLL cell per 10,000 leukocy tes or <0.01%. Peripheral blood collection for MRD analyses will begin at 12 weeks after randomization (DE1) and will continue in both treatment arms at each DEvisit until disease progression . A sample of bone marrow aspirate for MRD assessment for all responding subjects (ie, response of PR or better) must be sent to the sponsor at DE3 and DE6 (as described in Section 9.2.1.3 ). The first draw of the bone marrow aspirate should be sent for central MRD analy sis. Additional instructions for the assessment of MRD are outlined in a separate Laboratory Manual ."

Subjects who have a CRi fulfill the criteria for a CR, but continue to have persistent anemia, thrombocy topenia, and/or neutropenia, with a hypocellular bone marrow confirmed by bone marrow biops y. These cytopenias are considered due to drug toxicity in the bone marrow and are not related to CLL. Nodular Partial Response (nPR): nPR is a response thatmeet sthe criteria for CR, but the bone marrow biopsy shows lymphoid nodules, reflecting residual disease . Partial Response with Lymphocytosis (PRL) : PRL is a response where subjects meet the criteria for a PR and have persistent ly mphocy tosis. Stable Disease: Subjects who do not meet the criteria for CR, CRi, nPR, PR, PRL, or PD. Treatment -related Lymphocytosis: Treatment -related lymphocy tosis is define d as an elevation in blood lymphocy te count of 50% compared with baseline that occurs in the setting of unequivocal improvement in at least 1other disease -related parameter, including ly mph node size, spleen size, blood counts (hemoglobin and platelet count), or disease -related symptoms. Treatment -related lymphocy tosis is isolated lymphocy tosis that occurs when no other criteria for PDare met. It will not be considered PD. 9.2.4. Patient -reported Outcomes PRO assessments will be conducted as described in the Time and Events Schedules . Collection of PRO assessments will stop after the primary PFS analy sis is completed. Three PRO instrument s will be administered in this study : the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Qualit y of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ)-C30, the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) -Fatigue scale, and the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L). The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item general cancer assessment that incorporates 5functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning), 3symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain), a global health status and QoL scale (2items), and 6single items (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Scores range from 0 to 100 (for functional and global QoL scales, higher scores indicate a better level of functi oning). Differences of ≥10 points on EORTC scales are considered clinically important."

Items are scored on a 0–4 response scale (0=not at all; 4=very much).All items are summed to create a single fatigue score ranging from 0 to52,with higher scores indicating better functioning or less fatigue. A diffe rence of ≥3 points in FACI T-Fatigue score is considered clinically important . The EQ-5D-5L consists of a 5-item descriptive system and the EuroQol visual analog scale (EQ-5D VAS) of self-rated health, with scores ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100(best imaginable health state). Responses for the 5dimensions are combined into a 5-digit number describing a respondents’ health state that can be converted into a single index value or utility score (using the United Kingdom weights), ranging from –1 to 1, where lower scores indicate a worse health status. A minimum difference of ≥0.07 points change in utility score is considered clinically important; for the VAS health rating ,a minimum important difference is ≥7points change. 9.3. Pharmacokineti cs Plasma samples from venous blood collections for all subjects in Treatment Arm A will be used to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ibrutinib and its metabolite PCI-45227 ,and venetoclax . Plasma collected for pharmacokinetic analy ses may additionally be used to evaluate safet y and efficacy questions, drug characteristics, or certain biomarkers for future research. Genetic analyses will not be performed on these samples. Subject confidentiality will be maintained . 9.3.1.

Biomarkers To better understand the mechanism of action of ibrutinib and to develop predictors of resistance, bone marrow ,peripheral blood , and buccal swab samples will be collected as specified in the Time and Events Schedules . Plasma samples may be analy zed to identify biomarkers that may be related to treatment -induced changes and that may be indicative of respon se to and relapse following I+VEN treatment. Blood samples collected at screening will be anal yzed for IGHV mutational status, a stratification factor for randomization. Additional blood samples collected may be evaluated for protein expression and other RNA/DNA signatures that may predict primary or acquired resistance. Bone marrow aspirate may be characterized by gene expression profiling and somatic mutation analy sis by NGS to evaluate for potential biomarkers that may contribute to sensitivity or resist ance to therap y in CLL. Samples may be evaluated by other similar technologies to evaluate protein or RNA expression, cy togenetics or for somatic DNA anal ysis. Plasma and bone marrow samples will be evaluated for MRD by flow cytometry .MRD analysis by NGS -based methods may subsequently be performed . Stopping Analysis Biomarker analyses are dependent upon the availability of appropriate biomarker assay s and clinical response rates. Biomarker analysis may be deferred or not performed, if during or at the end of the study , it becomes clear that the analysis will not have sufficient scientific value for biomarker evaluation, or if there are not enough samples or responders to allow for adequate biomarker evaluation. In the event the study is terminated early or shows poor clinical efficacy , completion of biomarker assessmen ts is based on justification and intended utility of the data."

ECGs may be repeated at any time during the study if clinically indicated, particularly for subjects with symptoms related to cardiac arrhythmias .For optimal monitoring and management of cardiovascular toxicities while on the study , consider consultation with a cardiologist . Vital Signs Temperature, pulse/heart rate, and blood pressure will be recorded at screening. Assessment of pulse/heart rate and blood pressure is expected at every protocol -specified visit. Blood pressure and pulse/ heart rate measurements should be preceded by at least 5minutes of rest in a quiet setting without distractions (eg, television, cell phones). Clinicall y significant abnormalities should be recorded as AEs.If an abnormal heart rhythm is suspected, further investigation (ECG and/or Holter monitor) is required per investigat or’s discretion . Physical Examination A complete physical examination must be conducted at screening , in all DEvisits (Treatment Phase , Subsequent Therapy Phase ), and before the initiation of treatment with single -agent ibrutinib (Subsequent Therap yPhase) . The status of nodal lesions , theliver, and spleen must be reported at each DEvisit.Clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as AEs.Weight will be measured as specified in the Time and Events Schedules . 9.6. Benefit -risk Evaluations Benefit -risk assessment of I+VEN compared with G-Clb will be conducted by comparing between -treatment differences of key efficacy and safety endpoints. Efficacy endpoints may include PFS, MRD -negative disease status, OS, time-to-next treatment, and improvement in PRO measures. Safet y endpoints may include major hemorrhage, minor hemorrhage, leukostasis, serious infections, interstitial lung disease, atrial fibrillation, TLS, non-melanoma skin cancer, diarrhea, rash, hypertension, infusion reactions and other serious adverse events (SAEs) . Safet y endpoi nts that show no between -treatment differences will be noted but may be excluded from the benefit -risk analyses. Adverse events not in this list, but that show a clinically meaningful between -treatment difference may be included."

Refer to the Time and Events Schedules for the timing and frequency of all sample collections. Instructions for the collection, handling, and shipment of samples are outlined in a separate Laboratory Manual . 10. SUBJECT COMPLETION/ WITHDRA WAL 10.1. Completion A subject will be considered to have completed the study if he or she diesbefore the end of the study , or has not been lost to follow -up or withdrawn consent before the end of study (see end of study definition in Section 17.9.1 , Study Completion/End of Study ). 10.2. Discontinuation of Study Treatment Discontinuation of study treatment does not result in automatic withdrawal of the subject from the study . Subjects who discontinue study treatment should continue to have assessments performed as specified in the Time and Events Schedules or DEs prior to progression) . Asubject's study treatment must be discontinued if an y of the following occurs: The subject experiences disease progression or relapse The subject experiences unacceptable toxicity The subject becomes pregnant The subject refuses further treatment with the study treatment The investigator believes that for safet y reasons (eg,AE) it is in the best interest of the subject to stop treatment . The investigator must notify the sponsor within 24 hours if a subject has been diagnosed with disease progression and provide documentation of the diagnosis for review by the medical monitor. If a subject shows signs of disease progression on physical examination or laboratory assessment, the subject may continue study treatment until disease progression is confirmed by other modalities (ie, CT scan , bone marrow biops y). 10.3. Withdrawal From the Study Asubject will be automatically withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons: Lost to follow -up; Withdrawal of consent ; Sponsor discontinues study . If a subject is lost to follow -up, then every reasonable effort must be made by the study site personnel to contact the subject and determine the reason for discontinuation of treatment, withdrawal of consent, and/or failure to follow -up.All measures taken to establish contact with the subject must be documented."

Study treatment assigned to the withdrawn subject may not be assigned to another subject. Subjects who withdraw will not be replaced. If a subject withdr aws from the study before completing the assigned treatment, end-of-treatment assessments should be obtained. If the reason for withdrawal from the study is withdrawal of consent, then no additional assessments are allowed. 10.4. Withdrawal From the Use of Resea rch Samples The subject may withdraw consent for use of samples collected for research (refer to Section 16.2.5 , Long-Term Retention of Samples for Additional Future Research). In such a case, samples collected from the subject will be destro yed. Details of sample retention for research are presented i n the main I CF. 11. STATISTICA L METHODS Statistical analy sis will be done by the sponsor or under the authority of the sponsor. A general description of the statistical methods to be used to anal yze the efficacy and safet y data is outlined below. Specific deta ils will be provided in the Statistical Analy sis Plan (SAP) . 11.1. Analysis Sets The ITT population is defined as all subjects randomized into the study and will be classified according to assigned treatment group, regardless of the actual treatment received. This population will be used for efficacy analyses including , but not limited toPFS, MRD -negativity , and OS, and all anal yses of disposition, demographic, and baseline disease characteristics. The safet y population is defined as all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment. This population will be used for all safet y analyses and all analyses of treatment compliance and exposure. All data will be analy zed according to the treatment that subjects actuall y received. The pharmacokine tic-evaluable population is defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of ibrutinib and had at least 1 post -treatment pharmacokinetic sample. The biomarker population will include all randomized subjects with sufficient malignant cells collected from at least 1 timepoint during the study . 11.2. Sample Size Determination This study is designed to evaluate the effect of treatment on PFS and is powered for this primary endpoint. A median PFS of 27 months is reported for the G-Clbwhen it isused to treat patients with treatment -naïve CLL.21It is assumed that the PFS follows an exponential distribution with a constant hazard rate. Utilizing a 1:1 randomization, this study will enroll approximately 200 subjects (100 subjects into I+VEN and 100 subjects into the G-Clb treatment groups) to observe 71 PFS events. No interim analysis is planned due to the small sample size and short accrual period of this study ,"

The study is designed to detect aHRof 0.5 for the I+VEN treatment group relative to the G-Clb group (corresponding to an improvement of 100% in median PFS, eg, from 27months to 54months) with 80% power at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. A uniform accrual rate of 20subjects per month will result in a study duration of approximately 32 months after the first subject is randomized , with 10 months of enrollment and 22 months of follow -up to observe 71PFS events . 11.3. Subject Information The distribution of subjects by treatment group for each of the analy sis populations will be provided. The number of subjects enrolled, dosed, and discontinued will be summarized. Treatment discontinuation will be summarized according to the reasons for discontinuation and by treatment group. Demographic and baseline vital sign variables will include age, sex, race, ethnicity , weight, and blood pressure. Baseline disease characteristics (documented in the source documents and eCRF) will include time from initial diagnosis to randomization, histological diagnosis (CLL, SLL), stage of disease, and ECOG P S grade (0, 1, 2). 11.4. Efficacy Analyses Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the data. For continuous variables, number of observations, means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges will be used. For discrete variables, frequency will be summarized. For time-to-event variables, Kapl an-Meier estimates will be provided. The comparisons between the 2 treatment groups will be performed as follows: for the continuous variable representing change from baseline to a postbaseline timepoint, analy sis of variance will be used. For discrete variables, Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel chi-square test will be used. For time-to-event variables, log-rank test will be used. All tests will be conducted at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) will be provided, unless stated otherwi se. 11.4.1. Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint of PFS is defined as duration from the date of randomization to the date of disease progression or death, whichever occurs first. The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the IRC assessment of PDin the ITT population. The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the distribution of PFS for each treatment group. The stratified log -rank test will be used to compare PFS between the 2treatment groups, with stratification factor sIGHV mutational status (muta ted vs. unmutated vs. not available) and presence of del11q (yes vs. no) .The median PFS will be provided for each treatment group and the HR for I+VEN relative to G-Clb and its associated 95% CI will be calculated based on the Cox proportional hazards model stratified by the stratification factor."
76,page_76,"JNJ-54179060 (ibrutinib) Clinical Protocol 54179060CLL3011 Amendment 4 77 Approved , Date: 19 December 2019The sensitivity analyses for PFS based on investigator assessment andusing different censoring mechanisms will be performed similarly . Other exploratory analyses, such as sensitivity analysis to address the potential effect of an unequal number of subject visits that could result in unscheduled tum or assessments because of the different treatment schedules in the 2 groups, will be performed as appropriate . 11.4.2. Secondary Endpoints Thesecondary endpoints are defined as follows: MRD-negative rate is defined as the proportion of subjects who are MRD -negati vein the bone marrow (ie,<1CLL cell per 10,000 leukocy tes or <0.01% ). All randomized subjects will be included in this analy sis. CR rate is defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve CR. ORRis defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve a response (CR, CRi, nPR, and PR). Duration of response is defined as duration in days from the date of initial documentation of a response to the date of first documented evidence of PDor death. OSis measured from the date of randomization to the date of the subject’s death from any cause . If the subject is alive or the vital status is unknown, the subject will be censored at the date the subject was last known to be alive. Time -to-next treatment is measured from the date of randomization to the start date of any anti-leukemic treatment subsequent to the study treatment. Subjects without subsequent treatment will be censored at the date of the last site visit. Sustained hemoglobin improvement rate, defined as the proportion of subjects who achieve an increase of hemoglobin levels from baseline by ≥2 g/dL and lastsfor at least 56 days without blood transfusion or growth factors . Sustained platelet improvement rate, defined the proportion of subjects who achieve an increase of platelet levels from baselin e by ≥50% and last sfor at least 56 day s without blood transfusion or growth factors . For time-to-event endpoints, the Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the distribution of OS (including the 24 -month survival rate), duration of response and time -to-next treatment for each treatment group. Median times to event with 2-sided 95% CIs will be estimated. The log- rank test accounting for stratification factor will be used for treatment comparison except for duration of response . A Cox proportional hazards model will be used to provide estimates of HRs with 95% CI s. For categorical endpoints, the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel chi-square test with stratification factor will be used to compare the ORR, CR rate, the MRD -negativity remission rate and ratesof hemoglobin and platelet improvement between the treatment groups."
77,page_77,"JNJ-54179060 (ibrutinib) Clinical Protocol 54179060CLL3011 Amendment 4 78 Approved , Date: 19 December 2019Hierarchical gatekeeping testing procedure will be implemented for key secondary efficacy endpoints of OS, ORR, CR rate, MRD -negative rate, time-to-next anti-leukemic treatment , and time to worsening of PRO scores (Section 11.4.3 )to maintain the overall control of study -wise TypeI error. The sequential testing order of secon dary efficacy endpoints and time to worsening for PRO endpoints will be determined later and specified in the SAP. 11.4.3. PRO Endpoints PRO measures listed in Section 9.2.4 will be analyzed using the methods specified in Section 11.4. For individual items and sub-scale scores within the PRO measures, descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, and range) will be calculated for each time point, for changes from baseline at each time point, as well as for changes from baseline to the last value. Mixed -model repeated measures will be used for longitudinal analy sis of PRO score change for EORTC QLQ -C30 global health and physical function, FACI T-Fatigue total score, and EQ -5D-5L utility score and VAS score. Time to worsening in the PRO scores from the EORTC QLQ -C30 (global health status and physical functioning scores) and FACIT -Fatigue (total score) and EQ-5D-5L utility score and VAS score is measured from the dat e of randomization to the start date of worsening . Worsening is defined by clinicall y important negative change (Section 9.2.4 ). Time to worsening in PRO scores will be compared using the similar approach for time-to-event secondary endpoints (Section 11.4.2 ). 11.4.4. Subsequent Therapy Evaluations Apooled analy sis of outcome after ibrutinib re-treatment may be pursued using data from the current study and another clinical trial (ie, Study PCYC -1142 -CA). Details of the statistical analysis will be described in a separate SAP, as applicable. 11.5. Pharmacok inetic A nalyses All concentrations below the lowest quantifiable concentration or missing data will be labeled as such in the concentration database. Concentrations below the lowest quantifiable concentration will be treated as zero in the summary statisti cs. The number of subjects and samples excluded from the analy sis will be clearl y documented in the Clinical Study Report. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize ibrutinib ,PCI-45227 ,and venetoclax plasma concentrations at each sampling time point .Ibrutinib and PCI-45227 trough levels in presence and absence of venetoclax will be compared graphicall y. 11.6. Biomarker Analyses Biomarker studies are designed to identify molecular and protein markers associated with response to and relapse following therap y. Analy ses will be performed within each treatment group in total and stratified by clinical covariates or molecular subgroups. The associations of biomarkers with clinical response or time-to-event endpoints will be assessed using the appropriate statistical methods (anal ysis of variance, categorical, or survival model), depending on the endpoint. Results may be presented in a separate report."

Safety Analyses The safet y analysis population will consist of all randomized subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study treatment. The number and percent of subjects with TEAEs will besummarized according to intensity using the NCI-CTCAE Version 4.03, drug relationship, and outcome. Laboratory data will be summarized and descriptive statistics will be calcu lated. Changes in physical examination parameters will be summarized. The safet y variables to be analyzed include AEs, clinical laboratory tests (hematology and chemistry ), physical examination results, and deaths. Reduction in TLS risk will be assessed following ibrutinib monotherap y in Treatment Arm A (I+VEN ). Safety variables are to be tabulated by descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum; or n and percent). No formal stati stical testing is planned. Adverse Events The verbatim terms used in the eCRF by investigators to identify AEs will be coded using the Medical Dicti onary for Regulatory Activities . All reported AEs with onset during the treatment phase s(ie, TEAEs , and AEs that have worsened since baseline) will be included in the analysis. For each AE, the percentage of subjects who experience at least 1occurrence of the given event will be summarized by treatment group. Treatment -emergent AEs are AEs that occur after the first dose of study treatment, and within 30days following the last dose of study treatment; any AE that is considered study treatment -related regardless of the start date of the event; or any AE that is present at baseline but worsens in severit y or issubsequently considered treatment -related by the investigator. Adverse events of special interest with ibrutinib are the events of major hemorrhage. Subjects with AEs of special interest may be counted or listed. Adverse events of special interest will be summarized similarly to TEAEs. Clinical Laboratory Tests Laboratory tests will be summarized by hematology and serum chemistry , separatel y. Selected hematologic and chemistry laboratory parameters are detailed in Section 9.5.Descriptive statistics will be provided for the values of selected clinical laboratory tests at each scheduled on-treatment evaluation including the final value by treatment group. Percent change from baseline to each scheduled on-treatment evaluation and to the final value will also be summarized. For selected variables, the mean value and mean percent change over time will be presented graphicall y. A summary of the shifts in selected laboratory hematology and serum chemistry parameters from baseline to the worst toxicity grade during the study will be provided. The worst toxicity grade during the stud y will be tabulated. Physical Examination Descriptive statistics of changes from baseline will be summariz ed at each scheduled time point."

Descriptive statistics will be calculated at baseline and for observed values and changes from baseline at each scheduled time point. Frequency tabulations of the abnormalities will be made. 11.8. Benefit -Risk A nalyses For benefit -risk analyses, between -treatment differences will be shown with absolute rate or other difference measure s and corresponding 95% CIs. Both continuous and dichotomized version sof continuous endpoints will be shown . Adverse events may be further characterized by their NCI-CTCAE grade. Results will be displayed in tabular and forest plot form. Additional details will be provided in the SAP. 11.9. Data Mo nitoring Committee An independent DMC will be established to monitor data on a regular basis to ensure the continuing safet y of the subjects enrolled in this study . The DMC will consist of at least one medical expert in the relevant therapeutic area and atleast one statistician. The committee will meet periodicall y to review safet y data. After the review, the DMC will make recommendations regarding the conduct of the study . The DMC responsibilities, authorities, and procedures will be documented in a separ ate DMC charter . 12. ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING Timely , accurate, and complete reporting and analy sis of safety information from clinical studies are crucial for the protection of subjects, investigators, and the sponsor, and are mandated by regulatory agencies worldwide. The sponsor has established Standard Operating Procedures in conformity with regulatory requirements worldwide to ensure appropriate reporting of safet y information; all clinical studies conducted by the sponsor or its affiliates will be conduct ed in accordance with those procedures. 12.1. Definitions 12.1.1. Adverse Event Definitions and Classifications Adverse Event An AEis any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study subject administered a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the intervention . An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product. (Definition per International Conference on Harmonisation [I CH]) This includes any occurrence that is new in onset or aggravated in severit y or frequency from the baseline condition, or abnormal results of diagnostic procedures, including laboratory test abnormalities."

Serious Adverse Event An SAE based on ICHand EU Guidelines on Pharmacovigilance for Medicinal Products for Human Use isany untoward medical occurrence that at an y dose: Results in death Is life -threatening (The subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.) Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect Is a suspected transmission of an y infectious agent via a medicinal product Is Medicall y Important .* *Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is also appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening, or result in death or hospitali zation, but may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. These should usually be considered serious. Unlisted (Unexpected) Adverse Event/Reference Safety Information An AEis considered unlisted if the nature or severit y is not consistent with the applicable product reference safety information. For ibrutinib , the expectedness of an AE will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the IB.For venetoclax, chlorambuc il or obinutuzumab, the expectedness of an AE will be determined by whether or not it is listed in the approved labels .22,39,54 Adverse Event Associated With the Use of the Intervention An AEis considered associated with the use of the treatment if the attribution is possible, probable, or very likel y by the definitions listed in Section 12.1.2 . 12.1.2. Attribution Definitions Not Related An AE that is not related to the use of the intervention . Doubtful An AE for which an alternative explanation is more likely , eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), or the relationsh ip in time suggests that a causal relationship is unlikely ."
81,page_81,"JNJ-54179060 (ibrutinib) Clinical Protocol 54179060CLL3011 Amendment 4 82 Approved , Date: 19 December 2019Possible An AE that might be due to the use of the intervention . An alternative explanation, eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s), is inconclusive. The relationship in time is reasonabl e; therefore, the causal relationship cannot be excluded. Probable An AE that might be due to the use of the intervention . The relationship in time is suggestive (eg,confirmed by dechallenge). An alternative explanation is less likely, eg,concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). Very Likely An AE that is listed as a possible adverse reaction and cannot be reasonably explained by an alternative explanation, eg, concomitant drug(s), concomitant disease(s). The relationship in time is very suggestive (eg ,it is confirmed by dechallenge and rechallenge). 12.1.3. Severity Criteria Adverse event severit y is a clinical determination of the intensity of an AE. The severit y assessment for any non-hematologic AE or SAE should be completed using the NCI-CTCAE, Version 4.03(see below for hematologic AEs and SAEs) . Any AE or SAE not listed in the NCI-CTCAE Version 4.03 will be graded according to the investigator clinical judgment by using the standard grades as follows: Grade 1 Mild :Awareness of symptoms that are easilytolerated, causing minimal discomfort ,and not interfering with every day activities Grade 2 Moderate : Sufficient discomfort is present to cause interference with normal activity Grade 3Severe : Extreme distress, causing significant impairment of functioning or incapacitation. Prevents normal every day activities Grade 4 :Life-threatening or disabling AE Grade 5: Death related to the AE The investigator should use clinical judgment in assessing the severit y of events not directly experienced b y the subject (eg, laboratory abnormalities). Hematological Adverse Events Evaluation of hematologic toxicity in subjects with advanced CLL must consider the high frequency of bone marrow involvement at the initiation of therap y. The standard hematologic grading system for solid tumors may not alway s apply since asubstantial proportion of subjects will be considered to have Grade 2 to 4 hematologic toxicity before any therap y is given."

If the ANC was <1 x109/L (1,000/μL) before therapy, the subject is not evaluable for toxicity referable to the ANC. Reference: Hallek 200828 12.2. Special Reporting Situations Safety events of interest on a sponsor study intervention that may require expedited reporting or safet y evaluation include, but are not limited to: Overdose of a sponsor study intervention Suspected abuse/misuse of a sponsor study intervention Accidental or occupational exposure to a sponsor medicinal product Medication error involving a sponsor product (with or without subject exposure to the sponsor medicinal product, eg, name confusion) . Special reporting situations should be recorded in the eCRF. Any special reporting situation that meets the criteria of a nSAE should be recorded on the SAE page of the eCRF. 12.3. Procedures 12.3.1. All Adverse Events All subjects who receive treatment will be considered evaluable for toxicity . All AEs and special reportin g situations, whether serious or nonserious , will be reported from the time a signed and dated ICFis obtained until 30 day s following the last dose of study treatment ,or until the start of a subsequent systemic anti-leukemic therap y, if earlier . For subjects participating in the Subsequent Therap y Phase, all AEs shall be reported from the date of the first dose until 30days after the last dose of ibrutinib, or until the start of a second subsequent therap y, if earlier . Adverse events reported after 30 days following the last dose of study treatment should also be reported if considered related to study treatment. Resolution information after 30 days should be provided. All Grade 3 or Grade 4 AEs considered related to study treatment must be followed until recovery to baseline or Grade ≤1 oruntil no further improvement is expected. Cardiac AEs"

An y unresolved events will be followed for amaximum of 6 months. All AEs of special interest as defined in Section 12.3.3 related to bleeding or resulting in bleeding complications must be followed until rec overy or until t here is no further improvement. Expected progression of disease should not be considered an AE (or SAE). However, if determined by the investigator to be more likely related to the study treatment than the underly ing disease, the clinical signs or symptoms of progression and thepossibility that the study treatment is enhancing disease progression, should be reported per the usual reporting requirements (see Section 12.1). Asymptomatic treatment -related lymphocy tosis should also notbe considered an AE. Subjects with treatment -related lymphocy tosis should remain on study treatment and continue with all study -related procedures. Serious AEs, including those spontaneousl y reported to the investigator within 30days after the last dose of study treatment, must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form. The sponsor will evaluate any safety information that is spontaneously reported byan investigator beyond the time frame specified in the protocol. Otherwise, all events that meet the definition of an SAE will be reported as SAEs, regardless of whether they are protocol -specific assessments. All AEs, regardless of seriousness, severit y,or presumed relationship to study treatment , must be recorded using medical terminology in the source document and the eCRF. All records will need to capture the details of the duration and the severity of each episode, the action taken with respect to the study treatment, investigator’s evaluation of its relationship to the study treatment, and the subject outcome. Whenever possible, diagnoses should be given when signs and symptoms are due to a common etiology (eg,cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore throa t, and head congestion should be reported as “upper respiratory infection ”). Investigators must record in the eCRF their opinion concerning the relationship of the AE to study treatment . All measures required for AE management must be recorded in the sourc e document and reported according to sponsor instructions. The intensity (severity ) of non-hematological AEs will be assessed using NCI-CTCAE Version 4.03. Hematological AEs will be assessed using the iwCLLcriteria. The sponsor assumes responsibility for appropriate reporting of AEs to the regulatory authorities. The sponsor will also report to the investigator (and the head of the investigational institute where required) all SAEs that are unlisted (unexpected) and associated with the use of the treatment . The investigator (or sponsor where required) must report these events to the appropriate Independent Ethics Committee/I nstitutional Review Board (IEC/I RB) that approved the protocol unless otherwise required and documented b y the IEC/IRB . Subjects (or their designees, if appropriate) must be provided with a ""study card"" and instructed to carry this card with them for the duration of the study indicating the following: Study number Statement, in the local language(s), that the subject is participating in a clinical study"

Study -specific Design Considerations This is a randomized, open -label , multicenter Phase 3 study to compare the efficacy and safet y of I+VEN compared with the standard of care therapy G-Clb in subjects with newly diagnosed CLL who are not suitable for fludarabine -based regimens. All subjects will receive active treatment (either I+VEN or G-Clb). G-Clb was chosen as the comparator for this study on the basis of its efficacy and safet y, and because it is a standard of care regimen with fixed -duration regimen which is recommended by both US and EU treatment guidelines for use in this subject population.15,16,18,40While the G-Clb regimen is the current standard of care for patients with previously untreated CLL, the median PFS is less than 3 y ears. The rationale for the combination of I+VEN is supported by their complementary mechanisms of action and preclinical and clinical data showing its potential for deep, durable, MRD -negative responses which is anticipated to result in prolongedPFS (Section 1.5). Though each treatment has a different approach to therapy (eg, intravenous, cytotoxic drugs for 6months versus oral, targeted therapies for 15months), there is sufficient rationale for the I+VEN combination . Subjects who initially responded to fixed -duration treatment with I+VEN are expected to retain sensitivity to ibrutinib, supporting the use of the same agent after disease relapse. For subjects previously treated with G-Clb, single -agent ibrutinib is an appropriate and approved second -line treatment option. All participating subjects will receive supportive care and will be followed closely for safet y and efficacy throughout the study . Efficacy assessments will occur according to the internationall y accepted response criteria from the 2008iwCLLGuidelines. Safety assessments , including laboratory tests, will occur through regular clinic visits. Potential subjec ts will be fully informed of the risks and requirements of the study .During the study , enrolled subjects will be given any new information that may affect their decision to continue participation. They will be informed that their consent to participate inthe study is voluntary and may be withdrawn at any time with no reason given and without penalt y or loss of benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled. Only subjects who are fully able to understand the risks, benefits, and potential AEs of the study, and provide their consent voluntaril y will be enrolled. Subjects assigned to Treatment Arm A will have a maximum of approximately 508mL of blood collected during the treatment period. Subjects assigned to Treatment Arm B will have a maximum of approx imately 323mL of blood collected during the treatment period. After the treatment period, approximately 34 to 84mL of blood will be collected yearly in both treatment groups. During the Subsequent Therap y Phase, a maximum of approximately 176mL will be collected during the first year of participation. Thereafter, a maximum of approximately 92mL will be collected each subsequent year on treatment . This includes laboratory assessments"

Subjects will be informed that their participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw consent to participate at any time. They will be informed that choosing not to participate will not affect the care the subject will receive for the treatment of his or her disease. Subjects will be told that alternative treatments are available if they refuse to take part and that such refusal will not prejudice future treatment. Finally , they will be told that the investigator will maintain a subject identification register for the purposes of long-term follow -up if needed and that their records may be accessed by health authorities and authorized sponsor staff without violating the confidentiality of the subject, to the extent permitted by the applicable law(s) or regulations. By signing the ICFthe subject is authorizing such access , and agrees to allow his or her study physician to recontact the subject for the purpose of obtaining consent for additional safet y evaluations, if needed, and subsequent disease -related treatments, or to obtain information about his or her survival status . The subject will be given sufficient time to read the ICF and the opportunity to ask questions. After this explanation and before entry into the study , consent should be appropriatel y recorded by means of the subject's personall y dated signature. After having obtained the consent, a copy of the ICFmust be given to the subject. If the subject is unable to read or write, an impartial witness should be present for the entire informed consent process (which includes reading and explaining all written information) and should personally date and sign the ICFafter the oral consent of the subject is obtained. 16.2.4. Privacy of Personal Data The collection and processing of personal data from subjects enrolled in this study will be limited to those data that are necessary to fulfill the objectives of the stud y. These data must be collected and processed with adequate precautions to ensure confidentialit y and compliance with applicable data privacy protection laws and regulations. Appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data against unauthorized disclosures or access, accidental or unlawful destruction, or accidental loss or alteration must be put in place.

It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained. If the responsible investigator retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the responsibility . The sponsor must be notified in writing of the name and address of the new custodian. Under no circumstance shall the investigator relocate or dispose of any study documents before having obtained written approval from the sponsor. If it becomes necessary for the sponsor or the appropriate regulatory authority to review any documentation relating to this study , the investigator /institution must permit access to such reports. 17.8. Monitoring The sponsor will use a combination of monitoring techniques: central, remote and on-site monitoring to monitor this stud y. The sponsor will perform on-site monitoring visits as frequentl y as necessary . The monitor will record dates of the visits in a study site visit log that will be kept at the study site. The first post-initiation visit will be made as soon as possible after enrollment has begun. At these visits, the monitor will compar e the data entered into the eCRF with the source documents (eg,hospital/clinic/phy sician’s office medical records ). The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that all sources of original data required to complete the eCRF are known to the sponsor and study site personnel and are accessible for verification b y the sponsor study site contact. If electronic records are maintained at the study site, the metho d of verification must be discussed with the study site personnel ."

Findings from this review will be discussed with the study site personnel . The sponsor expects that, during monitoring visits, the relevant study site personnel will be available, the source document swill be accessible, and a suitable environment will be provided for review of study -related documents. The monitor will meet with the investigator on a regular basis during the study to provide feedback on the study conduct. In addition to on-site monitoring visits , remote contacts can occur. It is expected that during these remote contacts, study site personnel will be available to provide an update on the progress of the study at the site. Central monitoring will take place for data identified by the sponsor as r equiring central review. 17.9. Study Completion/Termination 17.9.1. Study Completion /End of Study The study is considered completed approximately 5 years after the last subject is randomized into the study or after 50% of the subjects have died, whichever comes first. The final data from the study site will be sent to the sponsor (or designee) after completion of the final subject assessment at that study site, in the time frame specified in the Clinical Trial Agreement. 17.9.2. Study Termination The sponsor reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study site closure visit has been performed. The investigator may initiate study site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination. Reasons for the early closure of astudy site by the sponsor or investigator may include but are not limited to: Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IEC/I RB or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines Inadequate recruitment of subjects by the investigator Discontinuation of further study intervention development . 17.10. On-Site A udits Representatives of the sponsor's clinical quality assurance department may visit the study site at any time during or after completion ofthe study to conduct an audit of the study in compliance with regulatory guidelines and company policy . These audits will require access to all study records, including source documents, for inspection. Subject privacy must, however, be"

The investigator and study site personnel are responsible for being present and available for consultation during routinely scheduled study site audit visits conducted by the sponsor or its designees. Similar auditing procedures may also be conducted by agents of any regulatory body, either as part of a national GCP compliance program or to review the results of this study in support of a regulatory submission. The investigator should immediately notify the sponsor if he or shehas been contacted b y a regulatory agency concerning an upcoming inspection. 17.11. Use of Information and Publication All information, including but not limited to information regarding ibrutinib or the sponsor ’s operations (eg,patent application, formulas, manufacturing processes, basic scien tific data, prior clinical data, formulation information) supplied by the sponsor to the investigator and not previously published, and any data, including exploratory biomarker research data, generated as a result of this study , are considered confidentia l and remain the sole property of the sponsor. The investigator agrees to maintain this information in confidence and use this information only to accomplish this study , and will not use it for other purposes without the sponsor's prior written consent. The investigator understands that the information developed in the study will be used by the sponsor in connection with the continued development of ibrutinib , and thus may be disclosed as required to other clinical investigators or regulatory agencies. Topermit the information derived from the clinical studies to be used, the investigator is obligated to provide the sponsor with all data obtained in the study . The results of the study will be reported in a Clinical Study Report generated by the sponsor and will contain data from all study sites that participated in the study as per protocol . Recruitment performance or specific expertise related to the nature and the key assessment parameters of the study will be used to determine a coordinating investigato rfor the study . Results of exploratory biomarker analyses performed after the Clinical Study Report has been issued will be reported in a separate report and will not require a revision of the Clinical Study Report. Study subject identifiers will not be used in publication of results. Any work created in connection with performance of the study and contained in the data that can benefit from copyright protection (except any publication by the investigator as provided for below) shall be the propert y of the sponsor as author and owner of cop yright in such work. Consistent with Good Publication Practices and International Committee of Medical Journal Editors guidelines, the sponsor shall have the right to publish such primary (multicenter) data and informatio n without approval from the investigator. The investigator has the right to publish study site-specific data after the primary data are published. If an investigator wishes to publish information from the study , a copy of the manuscript must be provided to the sponsor for review at least 60days before submission for publication or presentation. Expedited reviews will be arranged for abstracts, poster presentations, or other materials. If requested by the sponsor in writing, the investigator will withhold such publication for up to an additional 60days to allow for filing of a patent application.

The sponsor will not mandate modifications to scientific content and does not have the right to suppress information. For multicenter study designs and substudy approaches, secondary results generall y should not be published before the primary endpoints of a study have been published. Similarly , investigators will recognize the integrity of a multicenter study by not submitting for publication data derived from the individual study site until the combined results from the completed study have been submitted for publicatio n, within 18months after study end date, or the sponsor confirms there will be no multicenter study publication. Authorship of publications resulting from this study will be based on the guidelines on authorship, such as those described in the Internation al Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE )Recommendations for the Conduct, Reporting, Editing and Publication of Scholarly Work in Medical Journals, which state that the named authors must have made a significant contribution to the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analy sis, or interpretation of the data for the work; and drafted the work or revised it critically for important intellectual content; and given final approval of the version to be published; and agreed to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriatel y investigated and resolved. Registration of Clinical Studies and Disclosure of Results The sponsor will register and disclose the existence of and the results of clinical studies as required b y law."

HEMATOLOGIC Leukostasis There were isolated cases of leukostasis reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib. A high number of circulating lymphocy tes (>400,000/µL ) may confer increased risk. These subjects should be closely monitored. Administer supportive care such as hydration and/or cytoreduction as indicated. Ibrutinib may be temporaril y held and the medical monitor should be contacted. Cytopenias Treatment -emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocy topenia, and anemia) were reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib. Monitor CBCs monthly . Lymphocytosis Upon initiation of single -agent treatment with ibrutinib , a reversible increase in lymphocy te counts (ie, ≥50% increase from baseline and an absolute count > 5,000/µL), often associated with reduction of lymphadenopathy , has been observed in most subjects (66%) with CLL. This observed lymphocy tosis is a pharmacod ynamic effect and should not be considered PDin the absence of other clinical findings. InCLL , lymphocy tosis ty pically occurs during the first month of ibrutinib therap y and typically resolves within a median of 14 weeks. NON -HEMATOLOGIC Bleeding -related Events There have been reports of bleeding events in subjects treated with ibrutinib, both with and without thrombocy topenia. These include minor bleeding events such as contusion, epistaxis, and petechiae, and major bleeding events, some fatal, including gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, and hematuria. In an in vitro platelet functio n study , inhibitory effects of ibrutinib on collagen -induced platelet aggregation were observed. Use of either anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents concomitantly with ibrutinib increase sthe risk of bleeding. A higher risk for major bleeding was observed with anticoagulant than with antiplatelet agents. Consider the risks and benefits of anticoagulant or antiplatelet therap y when co-administered with ibrutinib. Monitor for signs and s ymptoms of bleeding. Ibrutinib should be held at least 3 to 7 days pre-and post-surgery , depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding. Subjects with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied. See Section 8.2for guidance on concomitant use of anticoagulants, antiplatelet therap y and/or supplements. See Section 4.3for guidance on ibrutinib management with surgeries or procedures."
105,page_105,"JNJ-54179060 (ibrutinib) Clinical Protocol 54179060CLL3011 Amendment 4 106 Approved , Date: 19 December 2019Infections Infections (including sepsis, bacterial, viral, or fungal infections) were observed in subjects treated with ibrutinib therapy . Some of these infections have been associated with hospitalization and death. Consider prophy laxis according to standard of care in subjects who are at increased risk for opportunistic infections (see Section 8.1). Although causality has not been established, cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and Hepatitis B reactivation have occurred in subjects treated with ibrutinib. Subjects should be monitored for signs and symptoms (fever, chills, weakness, confusion, vomiting, and jaundice), and appropriate therapy should be instituted as indicated. Interstitial Lung Disease Cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) have been reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib. Monitor subjects for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD. Ifsymptoms develop, follow the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section 6.1.1.2 ).If symptoms persist, consider the risks and benefits of ibrutinib treatment and follow the dose modification guidelines (Section 6.1.1.2 ). Cardiac Arrhythmias Atrial fibrillation ,atrial flutter, and cases of ventricular tachyarrhythmia including some fatal events, have been reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib, particularly insubjects with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, acute infections, and a previous history of cardiac arrhythmia . Periodically monitor patients clinically forcardiac arrhythmia . Subjects who develop arrhy thmic symptoms (eg, palpitations, light-headedness , syncope, chest discomfort, or new onset of dyspnea) should be evaluated clinically , and if indicated, have an ECG performed. For cardiac arrhythmias which persist, consider the risks and benefits of ibrutinib treatment, and follow the protocol dose modif ication guidelines (see Section 6.1.1.2 ). Cerebrovascular Accidents Although causality has not been established, cases of cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic attack, and ischemic stroke including fatalities have been reported with the use of ibrutinib in the post-marketing setting, with and without concomitant atrial fibrillation and/or hypertension. Regular monitoring and appropriate treatm ent of conditions that can contribute to the occurrence of these events is recommended. Tumor Lysis Syndrome Tumor lysis syndrome has been reported with ibrutinib therap y. Subjects at risk of tumor lysis syndrome are those with high tumor burden prior to treatment. Monitor subjects closel y and take appropriate precautions . Non-melanoma Skin Cancer Non-melanoma skin cancers have occurred in subjects treated with ibrutinib. Monitor subjects for the appearance of non -melanoma skin cancer."
106,page_106,"JNJ-54179060 (ibrutinib) Clinical Protocol 54179060CLL3011 Amendment 4 107 Approved , Date: 19 December 2019Diarrhea Diarrhea is the most frequently reported non-hematologic AE with ibrutinib monotherapy and combination therap y. Other frequently reported gastrointestinal events include nausea, vomiting, and constipation. These events are rarely severe and are generally managed with supportive therapies including antidiarrheals and antiemetics. Subjects should be monitored carefull y for gastrointestinal AEs and cautioned to maintain fluid intake to avoid dehy dration. Medical evaluation should be made to rule out other etiologies such as Clostridium difficile or other infectious agents. Should symptoms be severe or prolonged follow the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section 6.1.1.2 ). Rash Rash has been commonly reported in subjects treated with either single -agent ibrutinib or in combination with chemotherap y. Rash occurred at a higher rate in the ibrutinib arm than in the ofatumumab arm in Study PCYC -1112 -CA. Most rashes were mild to moderate in severity . Isolated cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including Stevens -Johnson syndrome (SJS) have been reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib. Subjects should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms suggestive of SCAR including SJS. Subjects receiving ibrutinib should be observed closel y for rashes and treated symptomatically , including interruption of the suspected agent as appropriate.

Woman Not of Childb earing Potential premenarchal A premenarchal state is one in which menarche has not y et occurred. postmenopausal A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. A high follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level (>40 IU/L or mIU/mL) in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT), however in the absence of 12months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measuremen t is insufficient. If there is a question about menopausal status in women on HRT, the woman will be required to use one of the non-estrogen -containing hormonal highl y effective contraceptive methods if she wishes to continue HRT during the study . permanen tly sterile Permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy , bilateral salpingectomy , bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation procedures, and bilateral oophorectom y. Note: If the childbearing potential changes after start of the study (eg, a premenarchal woman experiences menarche) or the risk of pregnancy changes (eg, a woman who is not heterosexually active becomes active), a woman must begin a highl y effective method of contraception, as described throughout the inclusion criteria. If reproductive statu s is questionable, additional evaluation should be considered. Examples of Contraceptives EXAMPLES OF CONTRACEPTIVESaALLOWED DURING THE STUDY INCLUDE: USER -INDEPENDENT Highly Effective Methods Th at Are User -Independent Failure rate of ≤1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Implantable progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb Intrauterine device (IUD) Intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS) Bilateral tubal occlusion Vasectomized partner (Vasectom ized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential and the absence of sperm has been confirmed.

Consider alternative agents with less CYP3A inducti on. A list of common CYP3A inhibitors and inducers is provided in Attachment 5 . Drugs That May Have Their Plasma Concentrations Altered by Ibrutinib In vitro studies indicated that ibrutinib is not a substrate of P-glycopro tein (P-gp), but is a mild inhibitor. Ibrutinib is not expected to have systemic drug-drug interactions with P-gp substrates. However, it cannot be excluded that ibrutinib could inhibit intestinal P-gp after a therapeutic dose. There is no clinical data available. Therefore, to avoid a potential interaction in the gastrointestinal tract, narrow therapeutic range P-gp substrates such as digoxin, should be taken at least 6 hours before or after ibrutinib. Drugs That May Have Their Plasma Concentrations Altere d by Venetoclax Venetoclax is a P-gp and BCRP substrate as well as a P-gp and BCRP inhibitor and weak OATP1B1 inhibitor in vitro. To avoid a potential interaction in the gastrointestinal tract, co-administration of narrow therapeutic index P-gp substrates such as digoxin with venetoclax should be avoided. If a narrow therapeutic index P-gp substrate must be used, it should be taken at least 6 hours before venetoclax. Antiplatelet Agents and Anticoagulants Ibrutinib Warfarin or other vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with ibrutinib. Supplements such as fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be avoided durin g treatment with ibrutinib. Use ibrutinib with caution in subjects requiring anticoagulants or medications that inhibit platelet function. Ibrutinib should be held at least 3 to 7days pre-and post-surgery depending upon the type of surgery and the risk of bleeding (see Section 4.3). Subjects with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied."

No dose reduction is required when study drug is restarted.

Stage II:Involvement of 2or more lymph node regions or lymph node structures on the same side of the diaphragm. Hilar nodes should be considered to be ""lateralized"" and when involved on both sides, constitute Stage II disease. For the purpose of defining the number of anatomic regions , all nodal disease within the mediastinum is considered to be a single lymph node region, and hilar involvement constitutes an additional site of involvement. The number of anatomic regions should be indicated b y a subscript (eg, II-3). Stage III: Involvement of lymph node regions or lymphoid structures on both sides of the diaphragm. This may be subdivided stage III-1 or III-2: stage III-1 is used for patients with involvement of the spleen or splenic hilar, celiac, or portal nodes; and stage III-2 is used for patients with involvement of the para -aortic, iliac, inguinal, or mesenteric nodes.

In alignment with recent health authority guidance, the sponsor is providing options for study -related subject management in the event of disruption to the conduct of the study . This guidance does not supersede any local or government requirements or the clinical judgement of the investigator to protect the health and well-being of subjects and site staff. If at any time the investigator assesses that the risk of treatm ent may outweigh the benefits, study treatment will be interrupted, and stud y follow -up will be conducted. Scheduled visits that cannot be conducted in person at the study site will be performed to the extent possible remotel y/virtually or delayed until such time that on-site visits can be resumed. At each contact, subjects will be interviewed to collect safet y data. Key efficacy endpoint assessments should be performed if required and as feasible. Subjects will also be questioned regarding general health s tatus to fulfill any phy sical examination requirement. Every effort should be made to adhere to protocol -specified assessments for subjects on study treatment, including follow up. Modifications to protocol -required assessments may be permitted after consultation between the subject and investigator, and with the agreement of the sponsor. Missed assessments/visits will be captured in the clinical trial management system for protocol deviations. Discontinuations of study treatment and withdrawal from the study should be documented with the prefix “COVID -19-related” in the Comments electronic case report form (eCRF). The sponsor will continue to monitor the conduct and progress of the clinical study , and any changes will be communicated to the sites and to the health authorities according to local guidance. Modifications made to the study conduct as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic shou ld be summarized in the clinical study report."

The remote method that is used for contact with the subject must be allowable per local regulations and fully documented in the subject source record. Protocol -specified laboratory assessments and physical examinations should be obtained locally , if possible. Where local laboratories are used, it is important to ensure appropriate documentat ion of laboratory reference ranges. After reviewing all available information, and if the investigator assesses that continued treatment is acceptable, contact the site manager to discuss alternative solutions for the provision of study treatment to subjec ts (see alternatives below). The remote contact with the subject, the local laboratory results, and the sponsor discussion should be documented in the subject source record. Similarly , at a minimum, a comment must be entered in the Comments eCRF clearl y designating as “COVID -19-related” and acknowledging the discussion between the investigator and the sponsor. If the subject is not willing or able to go to a local clinic/laboratory , remote contact (eg,telephone, videoconference, or other channels) with the subject is recommended, as well as a thorough review of the subject’s medical history , prior labs, and most recent disease evaluation. The remote method chosen must be allowable per local regulations and fully documented in the subject source record. If a ppropriate, treatment should be interrupted until new laboratory assessments are made. However, if the investigator assesses that continued treatment is acceptable despite the absence of new laboratory tests, contact the site manager to discuss alternative solutions for the provision of study medication to subjects (see possible alternatives below). Proper documentation of all discussions and decisions should be made in the subject source record and in the Comments eCRF. If any change in subject status is identified that may impact the subject’s safet y, then study treatment should be interrupted until the subject can be assessed. Any changes instudy treatment (dose, frequency , interruption) needs to be clearl y documented as “COVID -19-related”. When pandemic conditions improve, travel restrictions arelifted, and the subject is willing and able to come to the clinic, subjects should be scheduled for an in-clinic, follow -up visit. All deviations from protocol -required assessments should be documented in detail within the subject’s source record and should be clearly designated as “COVID -19-related ”. It must be documented if a visit is conducted remotel y. Source documentation should detail how each assessment was collected (eg, remote vs. on -site, central vs. local laboratory, vital signs taken at home by caretaker vs. delegated in -home nursing)."

The conversation with the subject must be documented in the subject source records. The subject must name the individual who will pick up study drug on their beha lf. This is necessary for site staff to confirm the study drug is provided to the appropriate individual, ensure proper chain of custod y of study drug, and to maintain subject privacy . Identification of who will pick up the study drug must be confirmed and documented in the subject source record. Investigative site staff may deliver study drug directly to the subject’s home. The chain of custody and transit conditions must be clearly documented within the subject source record. If no other alternative is feasible, direct -to-patient shipment of study drug from the site may be considered with prior approval from the sponsor. Site staff need to obtain permission from the subject and record this in the subject source record for direct -to-patient shipments. It is important to note this process is not allowed by the health authorities in all countries and a specific approval process must be followed with the sponsor before moving forward. If requested by the site, the sponsor will investigate local requirements andconfirm health authority requirements for direct -to-patient shipment. If approval is granted by the sponsor, specific procedures including shipment conditions, preferred courier services , and documentation requirements will be communicated by the sponsor to the site. If a subject is able to come to the site for a Cy cle visit but anticipates being unable to come to the next Cycle visit, the investigator may dispense study treatment for the current cycle and an additional cycle, after agreement with the sponsor’s medical monitor. Prior to continuing treatment with the additional study treatment, the subject should obtain protocol -specified laboratory assessments and physical examinations locally , if possible, and the investigator should conduct a remote contact as described above. After reviewing all available information, if the investigator assesses that continued treatment is acceptable, the subject may continue treatment using the previously supplied additional study treatment. Proper documentation of all discussions and decisions should be made in the subject source record and in the Comments eCRF. For subjects who have reason to believe they have been exposed to COVID -19 but do not yet have a confirmed diagnosis and/or are not showing symptoms of infect ion: The investigator should consider the risk/benefit of continuing ibrutinib based on the individual subject’s underly ing condition and the potential risks associated with COVI D-19. If the subject becomes symptomatic at any point, refer to guidance below for subjects with symptomatic COVID -19 infection."

Given that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV -2)is a new pathogen, a more cautiou s approach would be appropriate, with interruption for confirmed cases of SARS -CoV -2 infection of an y grade. On-site Monitoring Visits In case on-site monitoring visits are not possible, as per institution policies, the sponsor’s site managers may contact the investigator to arrange remote monitoring visits. Additional on-site monitoring visits may be needed in the future to catch up on source data verification. All of the above measures are recommended for consideration on a temporary basis during the COVI D-19 pandemic to enable continuity of treatment and to ensure that subject assessments, particularl y those assessing relapse and safet y, continue as outlined in the protocol without imposing health risk to subjects, their families, and site staff. Every effort should be made to complete all protocol -required assessments. Investigators should use their clinical judgment and risk/benefit assessment in determining if a subject can continue study treatment in the absence of on-site clinic visits. If remote visits are not possible, or if in the investigator’s judgment, appropriate safet y monitoring is not feasible in a remote setting, the investigator should consider temporaril y interrupting study treatment (for a maximum of 28 consecutive days, unless reviewed and approved b y the sponsor) or discontinuing study treatment."
