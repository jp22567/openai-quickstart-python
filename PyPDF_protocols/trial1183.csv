Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 18/Protocol WN39434, Version 3Study Design Description of Study Study WN39434 is a Phase III, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, multicenter, 24 -week ,efficacy ,and safety study of 10 mg of oral balovaptan QDin adults (18years old or older) with ASD, followed by a 2-year open -label extension period for subjects completing the double -blind treatment period . Subjects providing informed consent will undergo screening within 4weeks prior to the first double -blind study drug (balovaptan or placebo) administration. Eligible subject s will be randomized in a 1:1ratio in a blinded fashion to either 10 mg of balovaptan or matching oral placebo QD for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint isthe change from baseline at Week24on the Vineland Adaptive B ehavior Scales Vineland -IItwo-domain composite (2DC) score. Thus, for subject s remaining in the full study, the approximate length of the study will be 144weeks or 3 4months (screening [approximately 4 weeks], double -blind treatment [24weeks], and an open -label extension period [104 weeks] with a follow -up period of 12 weeks after completion of thetreatment phase) . Subjects will be recruited from international sites ,including sites in North America and limited rest of t he world (ROW )countries . Subject s who prematurely discontinue from study treatment or from the study will not be replaced. However, all subjects should be followed and their data (specifically, vital sign measurements, adverse events, concomitant treatm ent, Vineland -II, CGI-S, CGI- I, PedsQL 4.0 Core) collected up to and including the W eek 24 visit, regardless of their adherence to treatment. Randomization will be stratified by baseline Vineland -II two d omain composite (2DC) ( the average of Communication and Socialization domains) (60 vs. 60), sex (male vs. female), geographical region (North America vs. ROW ), and age ( 25 years vs.  25 years). The main analysis of the primary and secondar y efficacy endpoints will occur once the final data from all visits, up to and including W eek 24, have been collected and cleaned and the database has been locked. An interim futili ty analy sis will be performed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) when approximately 50% of subjects complete the W eek 24 visit. The iDMC will meet regularly to oversee safety throughout the trial and its activities will be described in a separate iDMC char ter. Secondary and exploratory endpoints will examine core autism sy mptoms (social interaction, social communication, and functional deficits), associated sy mptoms, impact on health -related qualit y of life, and broader impacts on study partners and family. Safety will be examined via adverse events, clinical laboratory values, electrocardiograms ( ECGs ), physical and neurologic examinations, and safety outcome assessments such as suicidality. Screening Period Subjects who are willing and who have given thei r consent to participate in the study will undergo a screening procedure within 4 weeks before the first study drug administration (Day 1). Subjects must meet all of the eligibility criteria in order to qualify for the study (see the inclusion and exclusi on criteria). The screening period can be extended to a total period of 6 weeks in cases when a laboratory blood test needs to be repeated for confirmation during the screening interval or for other relevant clinical, administrative, or operational reasons. Subjects must fulfill all the entry criteria for participation in the study . Double -Blind Treatment Period All subjects will undergo 24 weeks of double -blind treatment. The study will be unblinded following the primary database lock when the last enrol led subject has completed the double -blind treatment period and all the data have been collected and cleaned . Randomization (Day 1) will occur only after asubject has met all eligibility criteria. At the baseline visit (Day 1), s ubjects will undergo a s eries of assessments outlined in the schedule of activities. Breaks should be allowed between tests when necessary. If necessary, the baseline visit can be split into 2 consecutive day s, and the sec ond day will be considered the baseline visit date (Day 1). If either the W eek 12 or Week 24 visit is split over 2 days, study drug (balovaptan or placebo) must be administered QD after the completion of all assessments."
19,page_19,"Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 19/Protocol WN39434, Version 3After the pre dose assessments have been completed , each subject will receive an oral dose of balovaptan or placebo according to randomization . After completion of the post dose evaluations and following a medical check -up by a physician, the subject will be discharged from the study center. Although st udy visits will be conducted on site, checks for signs and s ymptoms of infection will be conducted every 2 weeks either at a site visit or by telephone call conducted by site staff. Asageneral rule, thetestsequence forallassessments should remain t hesame foragiven subject asestablished atscreening andbaseline.

It will be possible for assessments (e.g., the Vineland -II interview and subject assessments) to be conducted in parallel if the site has sufficient qualified raters available. Importantly, the sequence established at screening and baseline should remain the same for a given subject; however, subject assessments should be prioritized. At visits when blood samples areobtained , the order of assessments should be as follows: 12-LeadECGs Vital signs Physical and neurologic examinations Blood samples Note : ECGs and vital sign assessments should be completed before other invasive assessments such as blood samples and should occur following a short period when the study participant is able to res t (typically, at least 5 minutes), Open -Label Extension Period All subjects who complete the 24 -week double -blind treatment period areeligible for participation in the open -label extension period of the study.

The final follow -up visit for safety and limited efficacy will be conducted 12 weeks after the Week 24 visit for subjects who do not enter the open -label extension period or at the end of the open -label extension period for all other subjects. For subjects who discontinue treatment prematurely and will not retu rn for the Week 24 visit, the final follow -up visit should occur 12 weeks after the final dose. Independent Data Monitoring Committee All available safety data will be assessed on a regular basis by an iDMC. It is anticipated that these assessments will occur approximately every 6months . The iDMC will also undertake evaluation of any efficacy interim analyses. Details about the iDMC will be provided in the iDMC Charter. Number of Subject s Approximately 350 subjects will be enrolled in the study . Target Population Inclusion Criteria Subjects must meet the following criteria for study entry: Signed Informed Consent Form Males or females, age 18 years or older at time of signing Informed Consent Form Subject meets the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Version 5 (DSM -5) criteria for ASD for an autism diagnosis and is confirmed using A utism Diagnostic Observation Schedule , Second Edition (A DOS-2)criteria If the ADOS -2assessment has been performed by a certified rater and documented within 12 months of the screening visit, there isno requirement to repeat it. Social Responsiveness Scale , Second Edition ( SRS-2), proxy version, total t-score 66at screening A full scale IQ score 70 on the W echsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence®, Second Edition (W ASI®-II) The score should be confirmed by assessment during screening. Previous test results on the W ASI or equivalent scales such as Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Fourth Edition ( WAIS-IV) (including all subdomain scores) are accepted if the test has been performed within 12 months prior to screening by an appropriately qualified rater. Ability and willingness to fully comply with study visit schedule and regular assessments and fluency in the language of the site"
21,page_21,"Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 21/Protocol WN39434, Version 3Subject’s participation in the study or discontinuation of prohibited medication will not pose undue risks to the subject , in the investigator’s opinion Subject has an appropriate study partner, in the opinion of the investigator The study partner is someone who has regular and sufficient periods of contact (including regular conversations and face -to-face interactions) with the subject to be able to report on the subject’s status on relevant study assessments. The study partner should have sufficient capacity to evaluate social and commu nication changes in the subject and should be available throughout the entire duration of the study. The study partner will not be eligible to be a study participant in this study. Only at visits that do not require a study partner’s input on assessment s can a subject be accompanied by someone other than the study partner if the study partner is not available. Every effort should be made to have the same study partner participate throughout the subject's participation in the study. For women of childbe aring potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a contraceptive method with a failure rate of 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 28days after the last dose of study drug A wom anis cons idered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state ( 12continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1%per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone - releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices . The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovul ation, sy mptothermal, or post ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Women must agree to use an effective form of c ontraception during all phases of thestudy . No specific contraception methods for males are required. Note: The Sponsor does not require the use of male contraception because of the minimal seminal dose transmitted via sexual intercourse. Treatment with permitted medication s (at a stable dose for 12 weeks before screening) and behavioral therapy regimens (regimens stable for 6 weeks before screening), with the intent that such treatments remain stable throughout the study and with no expected changes before the W eek 24 visit Exclusion Criteria Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from study entry: General Exclusion Criteria Subjects who meet thefollowing general exclusion criteri onwill be excluded from study entry: Pregnan cyor breastfeeding , or intention to become pregnant during the study Females of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test result immediately prior to initiation of study drug. Neurologic and Ps ychiatric Exclusion Criteria Subjects who meet any ofthefollowing neurologic and psychiatric exclusion criteri awill be excluded from study entry: Previous initiation of new or major change in psychosocial intervention (including investigational) within 6 weeks prior to screening"

Hence, the total length of the study is estimated to be approximately 45years. Investigational Medicinal Products The investigational medicinal product s for this study arebalovaptan and matching placebo. Test Product (Investigational Drug) One tablet of study drug (balovaptan o r placebo) should be taken orally QD in the morning , with or without food. The tablet should be swallowed whole with something to drink . The first dose of the study drug will be administered on Day 1 after all pre dose baseline assessments have been conducted. At subsequent visits, study drug should not be taken until all protocol -mandated study assessments are completed, unless otherwise specified in the protocol . Stati stical Methods Database lock to enable the analy sis of the 24 -week, placebo -controlled phase of the study will occur once all subjects have either completed the 24- week assessment or withdrawn from the study early, and all data required for analysis have b een cleaned and verified. After database lock, t reatment assignments will be unblinded to the Sponsor . The final analysis of the 24 -week placebo -controlled period will be performed after database lock. The final analy sis of all data collected in the stud y, including the open- label extension, will occur after all subject s have completed the study. Details of theplanned statistical analyses me ntioned below in this section will be fully specified in theStatistical Analysis Plan , which will be finalized prior to the locking the study database and unblinding the study . Primary A nalysis The primary efficacy analy sis for this trial will compare balovaptan with placebo at W eek24. The following null (H 0) and alternative (H a) hypothe ses will be tested ata two -sided 0.05 level: H0: MEAN balovaptan = MEAN placebo versus Ha: MEAN balovaptan ≠ MEAN placebo for which the MEAN ROand MEAN placebo refer to the mean change from baseline for balovaptan and placebo, respectively. The analysis of the primary endpoint, the change from baseline at W eek 24 on the Vineland -II 2DC score, will be performed by means of a nalysis of covariance. The model will include the corresponding endpo int baseline score as covariate and treatment, age group, sex ,and geographical region as fixed effects. Based on this analy sis, least square means, standard errors, treatment difference ,and corresponding 95% confidence intervals will be reported. The effects on continuous secondar y endpoints, as well a s the short -term effect at 12 weeks will be similarly analyzed. As a supplementar y analy sis, a mixed-model repeated measurement (MMRM) analy sis,will be performed. The MMRM model will include the corresponding endpoint baseline score as a covariate, with visit, treatment, age group, sex ,and geographical region as fixed effects, and treatment by visit interaction; visit will be fitted as a repeated effect with unstructured correlation across visits within each subject . Determination of Sample Size The sam ple size of 350 randomized subjects (175 subjects per arm) provides 85% power to detect a difference in means between treatmen ts in the change from baseline at Week24 on the Vineland -II 2DC score of at least 4.0 points, assuming a two-sided 5% significance level and a standard deviation of about 12.5 points .A blinded interim analy sis of the change in Vineland- II 2DC score from baseline may be performed by the Sponsor to allow an increase in the sample size if necessary to achieve appropriate s tudy power."

The analysis will be performed by the external independent Data Coordinating C enter that generates the unblinded results reviewed by the iDMC on a regu lar basis. The iDMC will review the unblinded results for the primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline at W eek 24 in the Vineland- II 2DC score) and for the Adaptive Behavior Composite and the three individual Vineland- II domains standard scores. The iDMC will be given clear criteria, detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan, regarding what would constitute futility, and it is expected to recommend stopping the trial if the futility analysis results meet those criteria. If the analysis of the pri mary endpoint results at the time of this interim analysis indicates that the conditional probability of success for the trial is less than a prespecified threshold, then the committee may recommend that the trial be terminated for futility. The iDMC willcommunicate to the Roche Data Review Board (DRB) only this recommendation (whether or not to stop the study for futility); detailed results of the futility analysis will not be shared with the Sponsor unless specifically requested by the DRB .Roche DRB Chair (or designate) will make the final decision regarding stopping the trial. No adjustment for multiple comparisons will be made to the α -level for this analysis, as the decision rules for the futility analysis will not allow for the opportunity to stop the study early for overwhelming efficacy .

BACKGROUND 1.1 BACKGROUND ON AUTISM SPECTRUM DISO RDER Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) isaneurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent deficitsinsocialcommunication andsocial interaction andrepetitive patterns of behaviors, interests, oractivities. Theprevalence ofASD isbetween 1in 50 and 1in88children(Levy et al. 2009; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 2012) and is approximately 1 in 42 boys and 1 in 189 girls (CDC 2016). Core symptoms of ASD areusually observ edby3 years of age, although ty pical language developmen t might delayidentification of symptoms . It is estimated that approximately 1.2% of the overall population in the United States lives with ASD (Buescher et al. 2014), and it has been reported to be similar in the population in the United Kingdom (Brugha et al. 2011). Diagnosis rates in the United Kingdom for ASD in children are currently esti mated to be 1.1% of the total population, thus suggesting that the prevalence rates between adults and children do not differ. ASD is a disorder diagnosed in children that continues to have a life -long burden that follows the patient from childhood throug hout adulthood. Although initialsymptoms may beidentified betw een 12 and 24months, typically ASD does not manifest asaformal diagnosis, andevenifadiagnosisismade, this may not be stable (Kleinman et al. 2008; Chawarska et al. 2009). D eficits insocialint er action manife stthemselves as impaireduse of non-ver balcommunic ation,delayed and reduced interactions withpeers, abse ntsharingofenjoy able experiences andint erest withpeers, and lack of social judgm ent. Abno rmalitiesincommunica tioninclude a delay inverballanguage development, im pairedexpressivelanguag e,deficient language pragmati cs,aswellasstereotyped, repetit ive, or idiosyncratic useoflanguage . Females with impairments in social and communication function are typically more intellectually impaired (Fombonne et al. 2011; Stacy et al. 2014). Stereoty ped and repetitive beha vior manifests as a pr eoccupa tionwith stereoty ped or restrictedinterests,adhe re nce to routin es,rigidity,perseverativ e,motormannerisms,andpreoccupati onorfascination withparts of item s,andunusual visual exploration. In addition to these core deficits, individuals with ASD suffer from a range of co -morbid conditions, including irritability, depression or anxiety, attention deficits, obsessive -compulsive symptoms, seizures, and sleep disruption. Furthermore, adults with ASD are at increased risk of suicide compared with the general population. Individuals with ASD die on average 18 years before the general population (Hirvikoski et al. 2016). In addition , autistic adults without a learning disability were 9times more likely to die by suicide. This could be a reflection of the isolation and depression many people with ASD experience as data show that approximately 35% of young adults (ages 19 23 years) with ASD are unemployed or do not complete postgraduate education after leaving high school (Shattuck et al. 2012)."
30,page_30,"Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 30/Protocol WN39434, Version 3Theetiology of ASD is highly g enetic, although environmental factors also contribute . Herit abilityestimatesfrom fam ilyand twin st udies suggest that abou t 90% of vari ance canbeattribut edto genetic f actors(Levy et al. 2009). At pres ent, nopharmaco logical treatment existsfor the core deficits of ASD,and currentlyavailable treatments address only associated beha vioralproblems (Wink et al. 2010). Non-pharm acologicaltreatments have been dev eloped to addressthecore symptoms ; however,efficacy has not been p rovenin large cli nical trials (Warren et al. 2011). Thehypothalamic neuropeptides vasopressin (alsoknown asanti-diuretic hormone) and oxytocin, inaddition totheirwell-defined roles inthecontrol ofosmotic balance andin reproduction, appear tohave promi nentroles intheregulati onofhigher brainfunctio ns, such aslearning andmemory, emotional control, andsocial behaviors. Vasopressin mediates itseffect viavasopressin receptors (vasopressin 1a [ V1a],vasopressin 1b [V1b], andvasopressin 2 [ V2]), which areallmembers of theG protein coupled receptor family. V1a andV1b lead tointracell ularincreases in calcium throughthe phosphatidyl -inositol pathway,whereas V2iscoupled toadenylyl -cyclase andcyclic aden osinemonophosphate production. V1a receptors arethe primary subtypefound in theCNS, expressed inseveral areas of thelimbic system (hypothalamus, septum, hippocampus, and amygdala) butarealso present inseveral tissues(vascular smooth muscle, liver, kidney, platelets, and spleen) (Loup et al. 1991; Ostrowski et al. 1994; Ostrowski 1998) . V1b receptors arealso present inseveral brain regions butappear to bethe most important fortheincrease incorticotropin-releasing hormone induced adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion. V2receptors arepresent intherenal collec ting duct andmediate theantidiuretic effectsofvasopressin. Studies inanimals and humans have implicated thevasopressin system inthe modulation ofbehaviors related tobothcore andassoci atedsympt omsofASD. In non-human mammals, V1areceptors aredistributed inbrain regionsassociatedwith controlofstress a ndanxiety andsocial andaffiliative behaviors, including paren talcare, pair-bonding, s ocialmemory, andsocialaggression. Vasopressin levels have been shown tobe elevated during stress, asinduced bytheforced swim testinrats (Ebner etal. 2002) . Central administration ofaV1peptide antagonist hasshown anxioly ticeffec tsinanelevated plus -maze test, astandard animal model ofanxiety (Liebsch et al. 1996), andantidepressant -likeeffec tsinthe forced swim test, amodel of depressive beha vior. Similarly, V1areceptor knock out mice also showreduced anxiety in open -field,light-dark box, andelevated plus- maze tests (Bielsky et al. 2004; Egashira etal. 2007). Inaddition, central injection ofarginine vasopressin (AVP) inrodents (voles and hamsters) hasbeen showntoinduce offensive aggressive behavior (Winslow et al. 1993; Delville et al. 1996) , which canbeprevented byaV1areceptor antagonist (Ferris et al. 2006) . Scratching andgrooming, reminiscent ofobsessive -compulsive behavior, canalso beobserved inmice after central injection ofvasopressin (Meisenberg 1988) ."

Multiple studieshave shown genetic associati onsofthe AVPR 1Agene withASD, mainly withgenetic markers inthepromoter region ofthegene, which includes microsatel lites. However, it isunclear whichmicrosatellite allelesshow association withASD orspeci ficclinic al ph enotypes (Kantojärvi et al. 2015) . Consist ent withbehavioral studies inanimals (see above ),these riskalleles have been found to modulate activation of theamygdala during emotional face processing (Meyer -Lindenberg et al. 2009) andtobeassocia tedwithspecific personality traits in healthyvolunte ers(Ebstein et al. 2012) . Similarly, intranasal administration of vasopressin wasshown tomodulate theactivity ofanetwork involved in theprocessing ofemotional information withspecific effectsinthe subg enual cingul ate regions (Zink etal. 2010) . Additional evidence fora roleofvasopressin inmodulating behaviors ofrelevance to ASD is provided bystudies showing increased cerebrospinal levelsofvaso pressin in obsessive -compulsive disorder andaggressive beha vior(Zink et al. 2010) . Also, increased levels ofAVP inplasma ofsubjec tswithASD havebeen reported (Boso et al. 2007) ,although other researchers have been unable toreplicate this observation. In summary, there is a high unmet medical need for pharmacological treatments of these core symptoms of the disorder. 1.2 BACKGROUND ON B ALOVAPTAN Balovaptan isapotent andhighly selective human V1a receptor antagonist thatblocks theactivati onoftheV1aGprotein coupled receptor."

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd 33/Protocol WN39434, Version 3 1.2.2 Clinical Studies 1.2.2.1 Safety and Tolerability To date, balovaptan has been investigated in five completed Phase I studies in healthy volunteers (Studies BP25694, BP28318, BP28977, BP29279, and WP40038), and one completed proof-of-mechanism study (BP29412). Clinical pharmacology studies investigating the effect of CYP3A modulators on the pharmacokinetics of multiple balovaptan doses (WP40608 and WP40609) are clinically complete. Please refer to the Balovaptan Investigator's Brochure for detailed information. A Phase II study (BP28420, ""Vanilla"") in adult subjects with ASD has been completed and the recruitment for a Phase II study (BP30153, ""aV1ation"") in 5- to 17-year-old subjects with ASD was started in November 2016 and is ongoing. Study BP28420 was a proof-of-concept, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study that evaluated the efficacy, and safety of 1. 5, 4, and 10 mg/day of balovaptan compared with placebo in male adults (aged 18 −45 years) with ASD. The scheduled duration of treatment was 12 weeks. Key inclusion criteria included a Social Responsiveness Scale , Second Edition (SRS -2) total t -score ≥66, a Clinical Global Impression −Severity (CGI-S) Scale score ≥ 4 (moderately ill), and an intelligence quotient (IQ) score ≥ 70 generated on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence ®, Second Edition (WASI®-II). The study was conducted in a staged fashion as outlined in Figure 1. Figure 1 Study BP28420: Overview of Study Design Note: RO5285119 is the former name for balovaptan. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in social communication deficits in adult individuals with ASD, as measured by the SRS-2. In addition, a number of secondary efficacy endpoints were also evaluated, including the change from baseline in adaptive functioning and skills, as measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (Vineland -II), change from baseline in behavior and symptoms"

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 34/Protocol WN39434, Version 3as measured by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), the Repetitive Behavior Scale Revised (RBS -R), the Anxiety, Depression, and Mood Scale (ADAMS), and the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement (CGI -I). Inall, 223 subjects were enrolled in the study and 186 subjects completed the study. Ofthe 186 subjects who completed the study, 67 subjects received placebo, 26 received 1.5 mg once a day (QD), 69 subjects received 4 mg QD, and 30 subjects received 10mgQD. Two hundred thirteen subjects were included in the intent -to-treat (ITT) analysis dataset. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in social communication deficits, as measured by the SRS -2 total t-score after 12 weeks of treatment . The data analysis showed no significant treatment effects on the SRS -2 total t-score. The estimated effects for placebo in the three analysis datasets were 13.1, 11.4, and 8.3, which are in agreement with the placebo effect observed in recent trials (Berry -Kravis etal.2016). An effect size of 0.3 favoring balovaptan was observed between 10 mg and placebo. Several assessments were analyzed as secondary outcome measures of core symptoms, including the following: the Vineland- II Adaptive Behavior S tandard Composite score (hereafter referred to as Vineland -II composite score), the ABC, CGI -I, RBS-R, and ADAMS. The outcome of the assessment of the Vineland -II Composite score demonstrated a dose- dependent improvement in the composite score. The three individual domains of the Vineland -II Composite were also analyzed. Results show meaningful treatment effects, especially with the 10 -mg dose, for the Socialization and Communication domains. Balovaptan appeared to be safe and well tolerated in adult mal e subjects with ASD. Notreatment -emergent safety concerns were identified. A total of eight serious adverse events were reported for 4 subjects in Study BP28420. The serious adverse events included sinus node dysfunction (at the 1.5 -mg dose), syncope (4 -mg dose), and suicidal ideation (placebo). One subject (in the 1.5 -mg a rm) experienced four serious adverse events: two episodes of rhabdomyolysis, acute psychosis, and agitation. No serious adverse events were reported in the 10 -mg/day balovaptan treatment group. One death due to suspect edheart failure was reported 16weeks after treatment was withdrawn in the individual with the reported serious adverse event of syncope. Except for the case of rhabdomyolysis, all other serious adverse events, including the syncopal event and death due to suspected heart failure, were assessed by the respective investigators as not related to study treatment."

Subject s providing informed consent will undergo screening within 4weeks prior to the first double -blind study drug (balovaptan or placebo) administration. Eligible subject s will be randomized in a 1:1ratio in a blinded fashion to either 10 mg of balovaptan or matching oralplacebo QDfor 24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint isthe change from baseline at Week 24on the Vineland -II two-domain composite (2DC) score. Thus, for subject s remaining in the ful l study, the approximate length of the study will be 144weeks or 3 4months (screening [approximately 4 weeks], double -blind treatment [24weeks], and open -label extension period [104 weeks] with a safety follow -up period of 12 weeks after completion of double -blind treatment period or open- label extension period) . Subject s will be recruited from international sites ,including sites in North America and limited rest of the world (ROW ) countries . Subject s who prematurely discontinue from study treatment o r from the study will not be replaced. However, all subject s should be followed and their data (specifically ,vitalsign measurements , adverse events , concomitant treatment, Vineland -II, CGI -S, CGI -I, PedsQL 4.0 Core) collected up to and including the Week 24 visit ,regardless of their adherence to treatment. Randomization will be stratified by baseline 2DC score of the Vineland -II score ( 60 vs. ≥60), sex (male vs. female), geographical region (North America vs. ROW ), and age (25 years vs. 25 years) .The main analysis of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will occur once the final data from all visits ,up to and including W eek24,have been collected and cleaned, and the database has been locked. An interim futility analysis willbeperformed by an independent Data Monitoring C ommittee (iDMC) when approximately 50% of subjects complete the Week 24 visit. The iDMC will meet regularly to oversee safety throughout the trial and itsactivities will be described in a separate iDMC charte r(see Section 3.1.1.5 for further details) . Secondary and exploratory endpoints will examine core autism symptoms (social interaction, social communi cation ,and functional deficits) , associated symptoms, impact on health- related quality of life (HRQoL), and broader impacts on study partners and family . Safety will be examined via adverse events, clinical laboratory values, electrocardiograms (ECGs), p hysical and neurologic examinations, and safety outcome assessments such as suicidality."

All subjects completing 24 weeks of double -blind treatment will be eligible to enter the open -label treatment period with 10mg of balovaptan QD (see Figure 2). Figure 2Study Schema QDonce a day. Aschedule of activities for the double- blind and open -label extension treatment periods are provided in Appendix 1and Appendix 3,respectively. The schedule of activities for thefollow -up period is provided in Appendix 2. The total duration of the study (from screening through to study completion) for each subject will be approximately 144 weeks as described in the following sections. 3.1.1.1 Screening Period Subject s who are willing and who have given their consent to participate in the study will undergo a screening procedure within 4 weeks before the firststudy drug administration (Day 1). Subjects must meet all of the eligibility criteria in order to qualify for the study (see Sections 4.1.1 and4.1.2 ). The screening period can be extended to a total period of 6 weeks in cases when a laboratory blood test needs to be repeated for confirmation during the screening interval"
43,page_43,"Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 43/Protocol WN39434, Version 3or for other relevant clinical, administrative, or operational reasons. Subjects must fulfill all the entry criteria for participation in the study . 3.1.1.2 Re-Screening In exceptional cases, subjects not meeting the eligibility criteria can be re -screened once and uncertainties should be discussed with the Medical Monitor or designee. Re - screening will not be allowed if a subject previously does not meet the disease -specific inclusion criteria (e.g., Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule , Second Edition [ADOS -2] score , SRS, WASI -II). In cases where re -screening occurs, these assessments should not be repeated . 3.1.1.3 Double -Blind Treatment Period All subjects will undergo 24 weeks of double -blind treatment. The study will be unblinded following the primary database lock when the last enrolled subject has completed the double -blind treatment period and all the data have been collected and cleaned . Randomization (Day 1) will occur only after asubject has met all eligibility criteria. At the baseline visit (Day 1), s ubjects will undergo a series of assessments outlined in the schedule of activities (see Appendix 1). Breaks should be allowed between tests when necessary. If necessary, the baseline visit can be split into 2 consecutive days, and the second day will be considered the baseline visit date (Day 1). If either the Week 12 or Week24 visit issplitover 2 days, study drug (balovaptan or placebo) must be administered QD after the completion of all assessments. After the pre dose assessments have been completed , each subject will receive an oral dose of balovaptan or placebo according to randomization .

47,page_47,"Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 47/Protocol WN39434, Version 3It is anticipated that it may take from 18 to 28months to recruit all subjects for the study. Hence, the total length of the study is estimated to be approximately 45years. 3.3 RATIONA LE FOR STUDY DESIGN 3.3.1 Rationale for Balovaptan Dose and Schedule The double -blind treatment period of this study will allow the evaluation of the sa fety and efficacy of 10 mg of oral balovaptan tablets QD compared with placebo. Results from Study BP28420 suggest that 10 mg of balovaptan QDis the only dose level of the dose levels tested to have shown consistent efficacy across multiple domains of the Vineland -II and on other instruments explored. The safety profile of balovaptan across dose cohorts was similar . The 10 -mg balovaptan QD dose was associated with the largest improvement on the 2DC score of the Vineland -II, as well as individually on the Vineland -IIComposite and on the Socialization and Communication domains of the Vineland -II scales in Study BP28420. Th e 10-mgdose was also associated with greater concordance across the domains of the Vineland -II compared with other doses. Furthermore, a graphical evaluation of patient -level responses inStudy BP28420 shows that the 10 -mg balovaptan QD dose was associated with a greater proportion of positive response outcomes on the Vineland -II Composite score compared with either of the ot her two doses tested. Although the 4- mg balovaptan QD dose group had more subjects and resulted in a meaningful effect on the Vineland -II Composite score, the outcomes were overall less consist ent than those observed with the 10 -mgQD dose of balovaptan . Additional support for the use of a single- dose arm of 10 mg of balovaptan QD comes from the PedsQL 4.0 Coreresults in Study BP28420. The PedsQL 4.0 Core is a generic assessment of HRQoL for children, adolescents ,and adults (Varni et al. 1999, 2001) and provides subject insights into perceived treatment benefit (self -reported assessment), whereas the Vineland -II Composite offers the external perspective provided by a study partner during the structured interview and completion of the survey form. The Pe dsQL 4.0 Core was an exploratory measure in Study BP28420. Clinically meaningful improvements, as measured by the PedsQL 4.0 Core, were seen only with the 10 -mg QD dose, which produced a clinically relevant change above the minimal clinically important di fference threshold of 4.4 points on self -report at W eek12 (Day 84) (Varni etal. 2003)."
48,page_48,"Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 48/Protocol WN39434, Version 3Furthermore, the S ponso r’s internal study data suggest that occupancy of the V1a receptor reaches near maximal saturation with the 10- mg dose of balovaptan. 3.3.2 Rationale for Use of Vineland -II Adaptive Behavior Scales 2DC Score as the Primary Efficacy Endpoint The Vineland- II hasbeen used extensively in ASD research and include s standardization and validation in diverse populations, including in individuals withautism, Asperger syndrome ,or pervasive developmental disorder (Sparrow et al. 2005; Dawson et al. 2010; Virues -Ortega et al. 2013; Aman et al. 2015) . A recent Autism Speaks sponsored Working Group panel recommended the Vineland -II scales as suitable (adequate reliability and validity and responsiveness to intervention) to quantify social communication deficits in clinical trials of subjects with ASD (Anagnostou et al. 2015). The Vineland -II is organized into five domains measuring adaptive behavior of individuals from birth to 90 years old, including assessment of the performance of daily activities required for personal and social sufficiency (Sparr ow et al. 2005). To support reliability in interview conduct and structure, the Vineland -II Survey Interview, which is a semi -structured interview of the study partner administered by a trained interviewer and takes approximately 45 60minutes to complete , will be used. The Vineland -II will be administered and scored according to the manual (Sparrow et al. 2005). In this study, a novel composite score, the Vineland -II 2DCscore , has been selected as the primary endpoint, defined as the arithmetic mean of the Communication domain standard score and the Socialization domain standard score . Concepts measured in the Communication and Socialization domains of the Vineland -II map closely to the respective communication and socialization deficits in the subject -centered conceptual model of ASD generated through interviews conducted with people with ASD and their parents ( Willgoss et al. 2017). As such, the Vineland -II 2DC score enables a comprehensive assessment of social communication deficits in people with ASD. Vineland -II Socialization and Communication domain standard scores are reliable and valid (Sparrow et al. 2005) and have been used independently as endpoints in clinical trials of ASD (Scahill et al. 2016). To explore the measurement properties of the new Vineland -II 2DC score, which combines these two independently validated scales into a single score, the Sponsor has conducted a psychometric analysis of the score using data from Study BP28420 ( Roche internal data). The data show that the Vineland -II 2DC score is reliable, valid , and sensitive to change and support sthe Sponsor’s"
49,page_49,"Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 49/Protocol WN39434, Version 3proposal to combine the two domains into a single endpoint. Furthermore, the data were discussed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Eur opean Medicines Agency who have provisionally approved the use of the Vineland -II 2DC score as the primary endpoint for Phase III trials. 3.3.3 Rationale for Use of Responder Definition A clinically meaningful response is defined as a6-point improvement on the Vineland -II 2DC score at Week 24. This responder threshold was determined through anchor -and distribution- based analyses conducted on data from Study BP28420. Estimates anchored to global clinical impressions of verbal communication, non -verbal communi cation, social skills ,and overall ASD severity ranged from 6.0 to 7.2 points. Distribution- based estimates included 0.2 SD and 0.5 SD at baseline and 1 the standard error of the mean and ranged from 3.16 to 7.90 points. A threshold of 6points was sel ected following discussions with a panel of global ASD experts who agreed that individual change of this magnitude over a 24 - week period would be indicative of a clinically relevant response to treatment. 3.3.4 Rationale for Subject Population Study W N39434 will include both males and females. The prevalence of ASD has been reported to be approximately 1 in 42 boys and 1 in 189 girls (CDC 2016). Furthermore, females with impairments in social and communication function are typically more intellectually impaired and are less likely to meet the eligibility criteria stipulating an IQ score 70; only 1in 8 to 9 ASD subjects with IQ score 70 is reported to be female (Fombonne et al. 2011; Stacy et al. 2014). Therefore, the proportion of females who would be r ecruited is expected to be approximately 12 % of the total study population. To ensure that the subject population is representative of ASD epidemiology the proportion of female subjects will be limited to a maximum of 20% of the entire study population . Randomization of subjects will be stratified by sex. Study W N39434 is designed as an international study that will recruit subjects from regions, including North America and the RO W. The proportion of subjects from the ROW is expected to be approximately 20% of the total study population. Randomization of subjects will be stratified by region (North America vs. ROW ) to increase the reliability of subgroup analyses within each region. To limit the impact of diagnostic heterogeneity, eligible male and female subjects ages 18 must meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Version 5 (DSM -5)criteria for ASD, which will be confirmed using the ADOS -2. The ADOS -2 is a semi -structured, standardized assessment of communication, social interactio n, play/imaginative use of materials, and restricted and repetitive behaviors in ASD and is referred to as the ""gold standard"" observational assessment for diagnosing ASD (Ozonoff et al. 2005; Kanne et al. 2008)."
50,page_50,"Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 50/Protocol WN39434, Version 3Subjects with confirmed ASD who are exhibit ing impairments in social communication will be studied. For this study, the SRS -2 will be performed during screening; only subjects with a study partner completed (proxy) SRS-2 total t-score 66, consistent with moderate or severe symptoms, will be randomized. These assessments ensure that subjects demonstrate relevant deficits in social communication and social interactions and that, collectively, these symptoms result in a moderate- to-severe phenotype. Another dimension along wh ich subjects are commonly categorized is the degree to which intellectual disability is co- morbid with their ASD symptoms. From an assessment framework, there is no consensus on which cognitive measures are the most useful for subject categorization. In this study, the WASI®-II will be employed to ensure randomized subjects score above a ""cognitive floor"" (i.e., IQ score 70) and do not have intellectual disability, consistent with the ASD literature (Siegel et al. 1996). Full scale IQ and subscale score s will be collected. 3.3.5 Rationale for Use of Placebo To date, no pharmacological therapies have shown effectiveness treating the core symptoms of ASD and none is registered for its treatment in any global region. Pursuant to the Helsinki Declaration, when standard treatment of a disease exists, placebo should generally not be used in clinical trials (ICH 2000). However , Paragraph 33 of the Declaration supports the stance that placebo can be acceptable in the setting where no proven standard therapy exists. Given that no standard therapy exists for the treatment of ASD, a placebo -controlled trial is acceptable, provided that appropriate subject consent and safeguards are instituted to minimize the risk of serious or irreversible harm resulting from exposure t o placebo. 3.3.6 Rationale for Study Duration There are no published studies showing significant pharmacological effects on communication and social behaviors in ASD as measured by the Vineland -II. Nevertheless, behavioral interventions have shown benefits. Fo r example, Virues -Ortega and colleagues reported a systematic review and meta -analysis of the effect of the TEACCH program ( Virues -Ortega et al. 2013). Some of the included studies u sed the Vineland -II,and the duration of those studies ranged from 10to36 weeks, suggesting that the minimum length of a study to detect gains in adaptive behaviors in subjects with ASD, as measured by the Vineland- II,is in between these numbers. It is thoug ht that atreatment duration of 24 weeks would allow sufficient exposure to adequately and efficiently assess clinically meaningful responses in both social cognition and functional social outcomes as well as characterize the safety and tolerability profile of balovaptan ."
51,page_51,"Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 51/Protocol WN39434, Version 33.3.7 Rationale for Biomarker A ssessments ASD is a heterogeneous but highly heritable disease, with heritability estimates ranging from 64 % to 91% in twin studies and ranging from 31% to 71% in whole genome genotyping studies (Autism Spectrum Disorders W orking Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium 2017). Given that variants in the V1A receptor gene are among those previously associated with ASD risk (Tansey et al. 2011), not all subjects may be equally likely to benefit from treatment with a V1A antagonist like balovaptan. Additionally, V1Aantagonism is associated with rescue of social impairments and repetitive behavior in the CNTNAP2 knockout model of autism. This gene has also been strongly linked to ASD (Peñagarikano and Geschwind 2012). Therefore, biomarker samples that may be predi ctive of efficacy will be collected for genotyping the V1A receptor gene as well as the CNTNAP2 gene, prior to dosing , and will be assessed in an effort to identify those subjects who are most likely to benefit from balovaptan . Beyond the defined biomark ers above, available assessments from the optional Research Biosample Repository (RBR) (see S ection 4.5.9 ) will be utilized to evaluate the potential of novel biomarkers unrelated to the proposed mechanisms. 4.

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 52/Protocol WN39434, Version 3Subject’s participation in the study or discontinuation of prohibited medication will not pose undue risks to the subject, in the investigator’s opinion Subject has an appropriate study partner, in the opinion of the investigator The study partner is someone who has regular and sufficient periods of contact (including regular conversations and face -to-face interactions) with the subject to be able to report on the subject’s status on relevant study assessments. The study partner should have sufficient capacity to evaluate social and communication changes in the subject and should be available throughout the entire duration of th e study. The study partner will not be eligible to be a study participant in this study. Only at visits that do not require a study partner’s input on assessments can a subject be accompanied by others if the study partner is not available. Every effort should be made to have same study partner participate throughout the subject's participation in the study. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use a contraceptive meth od with a failure rate of 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 28days after the last dose of study drug A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not reached a postmenopausal state ( 12contin uous months of amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of 1%per year include bilateral tubal ligat ion, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone -releasing intrauterine devices, and copper intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Women must agree to use an effective form of contracept ion during all phases of the study. No specific contraception methods for males are required. Note: The Sponsor does not require male contraception because of the minimal seminal dose transmitted via sexual intercourse (Banholzer et al. 2012 ) (see Section 1.2.1 ). Treatment with permitted medications (at a stable dose for 12 weeks before screening) and behavioral therapy regimens (regimens stable for 6 weeks before screening), with the intent that such treatments remain stable throughout the study and with no expected changes before the Week 24 visit"

Such standard -of-care or ""background"" medications may include a variety of classes acting through different m echanisms to treat psychiatric symptoms commonly associated with ASD. It is also common for individuals with ASD to be engaged in a large variety of non -medicinal therapies, including individual, group, and behavioral -based psychotherapies. All psychothe rapies and medications to treat coexisting psychiatric symptoms and medical conditions should be documented on the eCRF and continued at a stable frequency and dosage from screening through the completion of the trial; any changes should be reported on the appropriate eCRF. Examples ofallowed medications include the following: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibi torand serotonin -norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressan ts,includingfluoxetine Atypical antipsychotics (e.g., aripiprazo le, risperidone) Melatonin Benzodiazepines, only on an as -needed basis"

66,page_66,"Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 66/Protocol WN39434, Version 3Lead placement should be as consistent as possible. ECG recordings must be performed after the subject has been resting in a supine position for at least 5minutes. All ECGs are to be obtained prior to other procedures scheduled at th esame time (e.g., vital sign measurements, blood draws) and should not be obtained within 3 hours after any meal. Circumstances that may induce changes in heart rate, including environmental distractions (e.g., television, radio, conversation ),should be avoided during the pre -ECG resting period and during theECG recording. For safety monitoring purposes, the investigator must review, sign, and date all ECG tracings. Paper copies of ECG tracings will be kept as part of the subject 's permanent study file at the site. Digital recordings will be stored at a central ECG laboratory. The following parameters will be provided as non -eCRF data : heart rate, RR interval, QRS interval, PR duration, uncorrected QT interval, and QT interval corrected through use of Fridericia’s formula (QTcF )based on the machine readings of the individual ECG tracings or, ifconsidered appropriate by the Sponsor, ECGs may be analyzed at a central laboratory. If at a particular postdose timepoint the mean QTcF is 500 ms and/or 60 ms longer than the baseline value, another ECG must be recorded, ideally within the next 60minutes, and ECG monitoring should continue until QTcF has stabilized on two successive ECGs. The Medical Monitor should be notified. Standard -of-care treatment may be instituted per the discretion of the investigator. If a PK sample is not scheduled for that timepoint, an unscheduled PK sample should be obtained. A decision on study drug discontinuation should be made, as described in Section 4.6.1 . The investigator should also evaluate the subject for potential concurrent pro-arrhythmic risk factors (e.g., electrolyte abnormalities, concomitant medications known to prolong the QT interval, severe bradycardia). 4.5.8 Clinical Outcome Assessments Subjects, study partners, and clinicians will use an electronic device to complete electronic clinical outcome assessments (eCOAs) with the exception of the ADOS -2 and WASI®-II (IQ) scales . All item-level, domain -level, and relevant total score data will be transmitted electronically to a centralized database at the eCOA vendor. The ADOS -2 and W ASI®-II data will be transferred to the electronic device by site staff and then transmitted as descri bed for all other scales. The data can be accessed by appropriate study personnel securely via the worldwide web. Entries should be reviewed for completeness by the site staff during the visit. Sites should only use paper forms for the scales specified. A backup device will be provided to each site in the event of device issues. Rater qualification for specific outcomes assessments, including, but not limited to, the Vineland -II, ADOS -2,and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM -A) scales will be reviewed per the criteria established by the eCOA vendor.

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 67/Protocol WN39434, Version 3If the same qualified rater is not available within the visit window, delaying the visit is preferred to changing the rater. The same rater or clinician will perform the Vineland -II together with the same study partner throughout the study as established at the baseline visit. Also , the same clinician should complete the Clinical Global Impression scale sfora specific subject for the duration of the study. Demonstrating good reliability and validity, the Vineland- II is recognized as an appropriate outcome measure in clinical ASD trials and will be used as the primary outcome measure in future ASD trials conducted by Roche. The Vineland- II assessment will be administered by qualified raters as a semi -structured interview performed with a reliable study partner. The Rater Academy will provide raters the opportunity to improve their skills in interviewing part icipants so that they can qualify as eligible raters for the this study (refer to Appendix 7for more details). 4.5.8.1 Vineland -II Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition TheVinela nd-IIisaninstrument thatmeasures communication, daily living skills, social izatio n,maladaptive behavior (notassessed in thisstudy) , and motor skills (not administered in adults and will not be assessed in this study ) (Sparrow et al. 2005 ).The Survey Interview Form (i.e., a semi -structured interview) will be administered to a subject’s reliable study partner in this study, during which the rater will ask the study partner open -ended questions relating to the subject’s activities and behavior.

The collection, storage, and analysis of RBR specimens will facilitate the rational design of new pharmac eutical agents and the development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for individualized drug therapy for subject s in the future. Specimens for the RBR will be collected from subjects who give specific consent to participate in this optional research. RBR specimens will be used to achieve the following objectives: To study the association of biomarkers with efficacy, adverse events, or disease progression To increase knowledge and understanding of disease biology To study drug response, including drug ef fects and the processes of drug absorption and disposition"

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 74/Protocol WN39434, Version 3To develop biomarker or diagnostic assays and establish the performance characteristics of these assays 4.5.9.2 Approval by the Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee Collection and submission of biological samples to the RBR is contingent upon the review and approval of the exploratory research and the RBR portion of the Informed Consent Form by each site's Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) and, if applicable, an appropriate regulatory body. If a site has not been granted approval for RBR sampling, this section of the protocol (Section 4.5.9) will not be applicable at that site. 4.5.9.3 Sample Collection One optional sample forDNA extraction will be collected per the schedule of activities in Appendix 1; however, if it is notcollected during theschedul edvisit, itmay becollect edat anytime (after subject randomization) during theconduct oftheclinicalstudy. Thesample collected forDNA extraction may besent tooneo rmore laboratories for analysis of germline or somatic mutations via whole genome sequencing (W GS)or other genomic analysis methods . Genomics is increasingly informing researcher's understanding of disease pathobiology. WGS provide sa comprehensive characterization of the genome and exome, respectively, and, along with clinical data collected in this study, may increase the opportunity for developing new therapeutic approaches. Data will be analyzed in the context of this study but will also be explored in aggregate with data from other studies. The availability of a larger dataset will assist in identification of important pathways, guiding the development of new targeted agents. For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual. RBR specimens are to be stored until they are no longer needed or until they are exhausted. However, the R BR storage period will be in accordance with the IRB/EC -approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority requirements). 4.5.9.4 Confidentiality Specimens and associated data will be labeled with a unique subject identification number. Subject medical information associated with RBR specimens is confidential and may be disclosed to third parties only as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or separate authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the subject, unless permitted or required by law."
75,page_75,"Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 75/Protocol WN39434, Version 3Given the complexity and exploratory nature of the analyses of RBR specimens , data derived from these analyses will generally not be provided to study investigators or subject s unless required by law. The aggre gate results of any conducted research will be available in accordance with the effective Sponsor policy on study data publication. Data generated from RBR specimens must be available for inspection upon request by representatives of national and local health authorities, and Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators, as appropriate. Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from the use of the RBR data will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened prop erty of the Sponsor, except where agreed otherwise. 4.5.9.5 Consent to Participate in the Research Biosample Repository The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses participation in the RBR. The investigator or authorized designee will explain to each subject the objectives, methods, and potential hazards of participation in the RBR. Subject s will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their consent at any time and for any reason during the storage period. A separate, specific signature will be required to document a subject 's agreement to provide optional RBR specimens. Subject s who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature. The investigator should document whether or not the subject has given consent to participate and (if applicable) the date(s) of consent, by completing the RBR Research Sample Informed Consent eCRF. In the event of an RBR participant's death or loss of competence, the participant's specimens and data will continue to be used as part of the RBR research. 4.5.9.6 Withdrawal from the Research Biosample Repository Subjects who give consent to provide RBR specimens have the right to withdraw their consent at any time for any reason. After withdrawal of consent, any remaining samp les will be destroyed or will no longer be linked to the subject. However, if RBR specimens have been tested prior to withdrawal of consent, results from those tests will remain as part of the overall research data.

Therefore, unnecessary withdrawal of subjects should be avoided and all efforts should be taken to motivate subjects to comply with all the study specific procedures and to be followed until the end of the 24-week placebo controlled treatment period. Every attempt should be made to keep subjects on study drug throughout the duration of the trial. Before permanently discontinuing study drug (either initiated by the subject or the investigator), an interruption should be considered. Subjects, who temporarily discontinue study drug for any reason, should restart as soon as medically justified in the opinion of the investigator. The investigator should show due diligence and explore all possible options to reach a subject who f ails to return to a visit. The site must document all attempts to try to contact the subjectin the subject's medical records and source documents. In order to avoid loss -to-follow -up, the investigator should ask the subject at the study start for the contact details of a relative or friend who can be contacted in case the subject cannot be reached. Subjects should not be with drawn from follow -up unless a subje ct explicitly withdraws consent to be contacted. All efforts should therefore be made to minimize the number of subjects who withdraw consent. If premature withdrawal from the study occurs for any reason, the investigator must determine the primary reason for a subject's premature withdrawal from the study and record this information in the subject's medical records and on the eCRF. 4.6.1 Study Treatment Discontinuation Subject s must permanently discontinue study treatment if they experience any of the followi ng: Any medical condition that the investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize the subject’s safety if he or she continues to receive study treatment"

Subject s who discontinue study treatment prematurely will not be replaced. All subject s who withdraw or discontinue from the study treatment early will be asked to return as soon as possible (and within 1 week after the last dose of study drug) for an early termination visit, when the primary and secondary efficacy assessments will be performed. Subjects will also be asked to return for assessments of the primary and secondary efficacy outcomes at the end of the 24-week planned visit, regardless of their adherence to treatment. If the time between the early termination visit and the 24 -week planned visit is fewer than 6 weeks, then subjects are exempted fr om the 24 -week planned visit. If the time between the early termination visit and the previous visit is fewer than 6 weeks, then subjects are exempted from completing again all the primary and secondary assessments at the early termination visit. 4.6.2 Subject Discontinuation from Study Subjects have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 87/Protocol WN39434, Version 35.2 SAFETY PA RAMETERS A ND DEFINITIONS Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording adverse events, including serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest, performing protocol -specified safety laboratory assessments, measuring protocol -specified vital signs, ECGs, and conducting other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the study. Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in Section 5.4. 5.2.1 Adverse Events According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subjec t administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution. An adverse event can therefore be any of the following: Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated wi th the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a known condition) (see Sections 5.3.5.8 and5.3.5.10 for more information) Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation from study drug Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those that occur prior to assignment of st udy treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies)"
88,page_88,"Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 88/Protocol WN39434, Version 35.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately Reportable to theSponsor) A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria: Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the subject at immediate risk of death) This does not include any adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death. Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.9) Results in persistent or significant d isability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event results in substantial disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to study drug Is a significant medi cal event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the subject or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above) The terms ""severe"" and ""serious"" are notsynonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to Adverse Events Severity Grading Scale ; see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache without any further findings). Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event recorded on the eCRF. Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting ins tructions). 5.2.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable tothe Sponsor) Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; s ee Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). Adverse events of special interest for this study are as follows : Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy's Law (see Section 5.3.5.6 ) Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study drug, as defined below: Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is"
89,page_89,"Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 89/Protocol WN39434, Version 3considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in a subject exposed to a medicinal product. This term applies only when a contamination of the study dr ug is suspected.     5.3 METHODS A ND TIMING F OR CA PTURING A ND ASSESSING SAFETY PARAMETERS The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections 5.45.6. For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ). 5.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each subject contact. All adverse events, whether reported by the subject or noted by study personnel, will be recorded in the subject ’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events). Any other adverse event should not be reported. After initiation of study drug, all adverse events , regardless of the relationship to study drug, will be report ed until 6 weeks after the last dose of study drug."
90,page_90,"Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 90/Protocol WN39434, Version 3After a period of 6 weeks from the last dose of study drug, investigators should only report any deaths, serious adverse events, or other adverse events of concern that are believed to be related to prior treatment with study drug (see Section 5.6). 5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be ad opted for eliciting adverse event information at all subject evaluation timepoints. Examples of non-directive questions include the following: ""How have you felt since your last clinic visit?"" ""Have you had any new or changed health problems since you wer e last here?"" 5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of A dverse Events Table 4 provides guidance for assessing adverse event severity. Table 4Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale Severity Description Mild Discomfort noticed, but no disruption of normal daily activity Moderate Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity Severe Incapacitating with inability to work or to perform normal daily activity Note: Regardless of severity, some events may also meet seriousness criteria. Refer to definition of a serious adverse event (see Section 5.2.2 ). 5.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events Investigators should use their knowledge of the subject , the circumstances surrounding the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating ""yes"" or ""no"" accordingly. The following guidance should be taken into consideration: Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (as applicable) Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments Known association of the event with the disease under study Presence of risk fa ctors in the subject or use of concomitant medications known to increase the occurrence of the event Presence of non treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the occurrence of the event For subject s receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for each protocol -mandated therapy."
91,page_91,"Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 91/Protocol WN39434, Version 35.3.5 Procedures for Recording A dverse Events Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. Avoid colloquialisms an d abbreviations. Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.3.5.1 Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms For adverse events, a diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by one adverse event re port based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 5.3.5.2 Adverse Events That A re Secondary to Other Events In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events ( e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious secondary events. A medically significant secondary adverse event that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF. For example: If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If a severe GI hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be reported separa tely on the eCRF. If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is unclear as to whether the events are associated. 5.3.5.3 Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between subject evaluation timepoints. Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF. The initial severity (intensi ty or grade) of the event will be recorded at the time the event is first reported. If a persistent adverse event becomes"
92,page_92,"Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 92/Protocol WN39434, Version 3more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Details regarding any increases or decreas es in severity will be captured on the Adverse Event Intensity or Grade Changes eCRF. If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated by changing the event from ""non -serious"" to ""serious,"" providing the dat e that the event became serious and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events. A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between subject evaluation timepoints and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recor ded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.3.5.4 Abnormal Laboratory Values Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: Is accom panied by clinical symptoms Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a change in concomit ant therapy Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., ALP and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adv erse Event eCRF. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below th e normal range (e.g., ""elevated potassium,"" as opposed to ""abnormal potassium""). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event. For exampl e, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as ""hyperkalemia."" Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.3 for details on recording persistent adverse events)."

A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: Is accompanied by clinical symptoms Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recor ded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.3 for details on recording persistent adverse events). 5.3.5.6 Abnormal Liver Function Tests The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3ULN) in combination with either an elevated total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as defined by Hy's Law ). Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the following: Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with total bilirubin 2ULN"

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 94/Protocol WN39434, Version 3Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with clinical jaundice The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abno rmal laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.2) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either as a serious adverse event or a nadverse event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 ). 5.3.5.7 Deaths All deat hs that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1 ), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be rec orded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ). Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinc t event. The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, ""unexplained death"" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), ""unexplained death"" should be replaced by the established cause of death. The te rm ""sudden death"" should not be used unless combined with the presumed cause of death (e.g., ""sudden cardiac death""). Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as described in Section 5.6. 5.3.5.8 Preexisting Medical Conditions A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. W hen recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., ""more frequent headaches""). 5.3.5.9 Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Autism Spectrum Disorder Medical occurrences or symptoms of deterioration that are anticipated as part of ASD should be recorded as an adverse event if judged by the investigator to have unexpectedly worsened in severity or frequency or changed in nature at any time during the stu dy.

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 98/Protocol WN39434, Version 3Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse events to the local health authority and IRB/EC. 5.4.1 Emergency Medical Contacts Medical Monitor Contact Information for A ll Sites Medical Monitor: ,M.D. (Primary) Mobile Telephone No.: Medical Monitor: , O.T. Mobile Telephone No.: To ensure the safety of study subject s, an Emergency Medical Call Center Help Desk will access the Roche Medical Emergency List, escalate emergency medical calls, provide medical translation service (if necessary), connect the investigator with a Roche Medical Responsible (listed above and/or on the Roche Medical Emergency List), and track all calls. The Emergency Medical Call Center Help Desk will be available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Toll -free numbers for the Help Desk, as well as Medical Monitor and Medical Responsible contact i nformation, will be distributed to all investigators. 5.4.2 Reporting Requirements for Serious A dverse Ev ents and Adverse Events of Special Interest 5.4.2.1 Events That Occur prior to Study Drug Initiation After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported. The paper Clinical Trial Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided to investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or emai l address provided to investigators. 5.4.2.2 Events That Occur after Study Drug Initiation After initiation of study drug, serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will be reported until 6 weeks after the last dose of study drug. Investigator s should record all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours after learning of the event) on the Adverse Event eCRF and submit the report via the electronic data capture (EDC) system. A report will be generated and sent to Roche Safety Risk Management by the EDC system. In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the paper Clinical Trial Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided to investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing"

Once the EDC system is available, all inf ormation will need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system. Instructions for reporting serious adverse events that occur beyond 6 weeks after the last dose of study treatment are provided in Section 5.6. 5.4.3 Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies 5.4.3.1 Pregnancies in Female Subject s Female subjects of childbearing potential should use the contraception method defined by the protocol for the duration o f the trial and for 28 days after receiving their last dose of balovaptan and should take all appropriate precautions to avoid becoming pregnant. Regular pregnancy tests will be performed during the study. Female subject s of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within 90 days after the last dose of study drug. A paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators. Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF . The investigator should discontinue study drug and c ounsel the subject , discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. In the event of pregnancy, the investigator must counsel the subject as to the risks of continuing with the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. Given there are insufficient, w ell-controlled data from studies testing the use of balovaptan in pregnant or breastfeeding women, all dosing of balovaptan must be suspended until the end of pregnancy and breastfeeding. Monitoring of the subject should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. Any serious adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or afte r the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. In addition , the investigator will submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available . 5.4.3.2 Abortions A spontaneous abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as the Sponsor considers abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 )."

A therapeutic or elective abortion performed for reasons other than an underlying maternal or embryofetal toxicity is not considered an adverse event. All abortions should be reported as p regnancy outcomes on the paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form. 5.4.3.3 Congenital A nomalies/Birth Defects Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female subject or a female partner of a male subject exposed to study drug should be classi fied as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). 5.5 FOLLOW -UP OF SUBJECT S AFTER A DVERSE EVEN TS 5.5.1 Investigator Follow -Up The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the invest igator, the subject is lost to follow -up, or the subject withdraws consent. Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial -related procedures until a final outcome can be reported. During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the subject ’s medical record to facilitate source data verification. If, after follow-up,return tobaseline status orstabiliza tioncannot be establish ed, an explanation should berecorded ontheAdverse Event eCRF. All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome andreported according totheinstructions provided inSection 5.4.3. 5.5.2 Sponsor Follow -Up For serious adverse events, adverse events of special interest, and pregnancies, the Sponsor or a designee may follow up by telephone, fax, email, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case. 5.6 ADVERSE EVENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER TH E ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING PERIOD The i nvestigator is not required to actively monitor subjects for adverse events after the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as 6 weeks after the last dose of study d rug). However, t he Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware"

Independent from the causality assessment, the following serious adverse events and non-serious adverse events of special interest will be reported to the FDA on an expedited basis: death, arrhythmia, syncope, dyspnea, palpitations, and chest pain . To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will assess the expectedness of these events to balovaptan using the following reference document: Balovaptan Investigator's Brochure The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed. An i DMC will monitor the incidence of these events during the study. An aggregate report of any clinically relevant imbalances that do not favor the test product will be submitted to health authorities. 6. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS AND ANAL YSIS PLAN Database lock to enable the anal ysis of the 24 -week ,placebo -controlled phase of the study will occur once all subjects have either completed the 24- week assessment or withdrawn from the study earl y, and all data required for analysis have been cleaned and verified. After database lock, treatment assignments will be unblinded to the Sponsor . The final analysis of the 24- week placebo- controlled period will be performed after database lock .

Randomized subjects who receive incorrect therapy from that intended will be summarized in the group according to their planned randomized treatment. The ITT population will be the primary population for all analyses of primary and secondary efficacy variables. 6.2 DETERMINA TION OF SAMPLE SIZE The sample size of 350randomized subjects (175 subjects per arm) provides 85% power to detect a difference in means between treatmen ts in the change from baseline atWeek24 on the Vineland -II 2DC score of at least 4.0 points, assuming a two-sided 5% significance level and a standard deviation of about 12.5 points .A blinded interim analysis of the change i n Vineland -II 2DC score from baseline may be performed by the Sponsor to allow an increase in the sample size if necessary to achieve appropriate study power . 6.3 SUMMA RIES OF CONDUCT OF STUDY The number of subject s who enroll, discontinue, or complete the study will be summarized by treatment group .

Intercurrent events that occur after treatment initiation and either preclude observation of the variable or affect its interpretation might occur. The appropriate strategy to treat intercurrent events will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan . As a general principle, if treatment discontinuation is due to: Study drug related reasons (e.g., treatment -related adverse event, or lack of efficacy) then the actual “off -treatment” values will be used in the analysis Not study drug related reasons (e.g., lost to follow -up), then “imputed hypothetical” values, as if subjects had continued receiving study drug, will be used in the analysis The primary statistical analysis will be performed according to a combination of ""treatment -policy strategy ""and ""hypothetical strategy ""in order to account f or the different types of inter current events . The Sponsor will put mechanisms in place to ensure that, as much as possible, all subject s are followed and their data are collected, up to and including the W eek 24 visit, regardless of their adherence to treatment ( ""retrieved dropout ""strategy). In case missing data are still present ,imputati on techniques may be considered separately for each treatment arm by using values while the subject was ""on-treatment.""

104,page_104,"Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 104/Protocol WN39434, Version 36.5.5 Primary Efficacy Analysis The primary efficacy analysis for this trial will compare balovaptan with placebo at Week24. The following null (H 0) and alternative (H a) hypotheses will be tested at a two-sided 0.05 level: H0: MEAN balovaptan = MEAN placebo versus Ha: MEAN balovaptan ≠ MEAN placebo for which the MEAN ROand MEAN placebo refer to the mean change from baseline for balovaptan and placebo, respectively. The analysis of the primary endpoint, the change from baseline at Week 24 on the Vineland -II 2DC score, will be performed by means of analysis of covariance. The model will include the corresponding endpo int baseline score as covariate and treatment, age group, sex ,and geographical region as fixed effects. Based on this analysis, least square means, standard errors, treatment difference, and corresponding 95% confidence int ervals will be reported. The effects on continuous secondary endpoints ,as well as the short -term effect at 12weeks will be similarly analyzed. As a supplementary analysis, a mixed-model repeated measurement (MMRM) analysis , will be performed. The MMRM model will include the corresponding endpoint baseline score as a covariate, with visit, treatment, age group, sex ,and geographical region as fixed effects, and treatment by visit interaction; visit will be fitted as a repeated effect with unstructured co rrelation across visits within each subject . 6.5.6 Secondary Efficacy Analy ses Similar hypotheses will also be tested for the secondary continuous efficacy parameters. Methods for controlling the type I error in the testing of secondary endpoints as well as their hierarchical order will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan. Categorical endpoints, such as theCGI-I and change from baseline of CGI -S, will be analy zed by means of logistic regression after dichotomizing the results into two categories (i mproved and not improved), considering the CGI -S baseline value as a covariate, andtreatment, age group, sex and geographical region as factors . Logistic regression will be performed also for the responder endpoint, considering the Vineland -II 2DC score at baseline as a covariate, andtreatment, age group, sex ,and geographical region as factors . 6.5.7 Subgroup A nalyses The results of selected efficacy variables will be summarized within subgroups using descriptive statistics. The following variables will be u sed to define the subgroups: Baseline 2DC score of the Vineland -II (60 vs. 60)"

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 105/Protocol WN39434, Version 3Sex (male vs. female) Geographical region (North America vs. ROW ) Age (25 years vs. 25 years) Additional exploratory analyses of efficacy results may be performed using an MMRM model, with subgroup, treatment -by-subgroup interaction, and subgroup -by-time interaction terms included along the independent effects described above. Such exploratory analyses will be performed if the descriptive statistics results indicate substa ntial differences between the subgroups. 6.5.8 Exploratory Analyses The exploratory endpoints will be summarized using tables, listings ,and graphs as appropriate. 6.5.9 Futility Analyses One or more interim futility analyses willbe performed during the study. The analysis will be performed by the external independent Data Coordinating Center that generates the unblinded results reviewed by the iDMC on a regular basis, as described in Section 3.1.1.6 . The iDMC will review the unblinded results for the primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline at Week 24 in the Vineland -II 2DC score) and for the Adaptive Behavior Composite and the three individual Vineland -II domains standard scores. The iDMC will be given clear criteria, detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan, regarding what would constitute futility, and it is expected to recommend stopping the trial if the futility analysis res ults meet those criteria. Ifthe analysis of the primary endpoint results at the time of this interim analysis indicates that the conditional probability of success for the trial is less than a prespecified threshold, then the committee may recommend that the trial be terminated for futility. The iDMC will communicate to the Roche Data Review Board (DRB) only this recommendation (whether or not to stop the study for futility); detailed results of the futility analysis will not be shared with the Sponsor u nless specifically requested by the DRB. Roche DRB Chair (or designate) will make the final decision regarding stopping the trial. No adjustment for multiple comparisons will be made to the -level for this analysis, as the decision rules for the futility analysis will not allow for the opportunity to stop the study early for overwhelming efficacy.

Non -linear mixed effects modeling (using the software, NONMEM) will be used to analyze the concentration time data of balovaptan . The starting model will be a model developed based on data from previous Phase I/II studies (Roche Report No. 1081347). The data collected in this study may be pooled with data collected in previous studies as appropriate to inform the population -PK model. Population and individual primary PKparameters (e.g. ,clearances and volumes) will be estimated. Secondary PK parameters such as AUC and maximum plasma concentration will be derived from the individual post -hoc predictions. In addition, measured plasma concentrations of M2 (as applicable) and M3 metabolites will be summarized by timepoint and the relationship of parent and metabolite ,as well as the influence of covariates of interest may be explored graphi cally. Plasma concentrations of balovaptan, its metabolites M2 (RO7045402) as applicable ,and M3 (RO5273004) will be measured using a specific and validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method. Graphical exploration of the relationship between balovaptan exposure and the Vineland -II 2DC score and other selected clinical efficacy and safety endpoints will be performed.

DATA COLLECTION A ND MANAGEMENT 7.1 DATA QUA LITY ASSURA NCE The Sponsor will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality checking of the data. Data entered manually will be collected via EDC through use of eCRFs. Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system. In the event of discrepant data, the Sponsor will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. Discrepancies in vendor data (e.g. ,central laboratory and e COA) will be managed outside of the EDC system. The Sponsor will produce an EDC Study Specification document (Data Quality Review Plan andData Management Plan) that describes the quality checking to be performed on the data. Central laborat ory data and e COA data will be sent directly to the Sponsor, using the Sponsor’s standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data. eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail. System backups for data stored by the Sponsor and records retention for the study data will be consistent with the Sponsor’s standard procedures. eCOA data will be collected through the use of an electronic device provided by a vendor (see Section 7.3for details) . 7.2 ELECTRONIC CA SE REPO RT FORMS eCRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -designated EDC system. Sites will receive training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion. eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in accordance with i nstructions from the Sponsor. All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff. eCRFs should be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee. At the end of the study, the investigator will receive subject data for his or her site in a readable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the study records. Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is required. 7.3 ELECTRONIC CLINICA LOUTCOME DA TA Subject s, study partners, and clinicians will use an ele ctronic device to capture eCOA data. The device is designed for entry of data in a way that is attributable, secure, and accurate, in compliance with U.S. FDA regulations for electr onic records (21 CFR,"
108,page_108,"Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 108/Protocol WN39434, Version 3Part 11). The data will be transmitted to a central ized database maintained by the electronic device vendor. Theelectronic data will be available for view access only ,via a secure vendor web portal . Only identified and trained users may view the data, and their actions will become part of the audit trai l. The Sponsor will have view access only. System backups for data stored by the Sponsor and records retention for the study data will be consistent with the Sponsor’s standard procedures. Once the study is complete, the data, audit trail, and trial and system documentation will be archived. The investigator will receive subject data for the site in both human -and machine- readable formats on an archival -quality compact disc that must be kept with the study records as source data. Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is required. In addition, the Sponsor will receive all data in a machine -readable format on a compact disc. 7.4 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification and review to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered onthe eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which subject data are recorded and documented for the f irst time. They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, PROs , evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, subject files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico- technical departments involved in a clinical trial. Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan. This includes any protocol data to be entered directly onthe eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data.

Inaddition, any subject recruitment materials must be approved by the IRB/EC. The Principal Investigator is responsible for providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and procedures established by the IRB/EC. Investigators are also responsible for promptly informing the IRB/EC of any protocol am endments (see Section 9.6). In addition to the requirements for reporting all adverse events to the Sponsor, investigators must comply with requireme nts for reporting serious adverse events to the local health authority and IRB/EC. Investigators may receive written IND safety reports or other safety -related communications from the Sponsor. Investigators are responsible for ensuring that such reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with health authority requirements and the policies and procedures established by their IRB/EC, and archived in the site’s study file. 8.4 CONFIDENTIA LITY The Sponsor maintains confidentiality standards by coding each subject enrolled in the study through assignment of a unique subject identification number. This means that subject names are not included in data sets that are transmitted to any Sponsor location. Subject medical information obtained by this study is con fidential and may be disclosed to third parties only as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or separate authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the subject , unless permitted or required by law. Medical information may be given to a subject ’s personal physician or other appropriate medical personnel responsible for the subject’s welfare for treatment purposes. Given the complexity and exploratory nature of exploratory biomarker analyses, data derived from these anal yses will generally not be provided to study investigators or subject s unless required by law. The aggregate results of any conducted research will be available in accordance with the effective Roche policy on study data publication (see Section 9.5). Data generated by this study must be available for inspection upon request by representatives of national and local health authorities, Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators, and the IRB/EC for each study site, as appropriate."
