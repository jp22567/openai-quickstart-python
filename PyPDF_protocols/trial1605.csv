Page 6 of 75 Abstract Background The most common growth -related injury is Osgood Schlatter, which affects up to 1 in 5 physically active adolescents . It can cause long -term pain and potential discontinuation of sports and physical activity, with sequela well into adulthood. No effective treatments have been documented, and clinical practice is characterized b y a wealth of conflicting advice and modalities. A novel treatment approach has shown promising results in a small single -cohort study. Therefore, we aim to compare this novel treatment with usual care in 10 -16-year -old adolescents with Osgood Schlatter. Methods This single -center pragmatic, double -blinded, randomized, controlled superiority trial, will have a two -group parallel arm design. Participants will undergo 3 months of treatment, followed by 2 months of self - management with self -reported knee func tion (KO OS-child ‘Sport/rec’) at 5 months as the primary endpoint. In this protocol, we outline the planned methods and procedures, including the statistical analyses plan. Discussion This trial comparing a novel treatment with usual care for adolescents with Os good Schlatter could result in an evidence -based treatment that is ready for implementation in clinical practice, benefitting patient outcomes and clinicians.

Page 7 of 75 Introduction Background and rationale {6a} Being physically active during adult life is key for health and prevention of disease and carries additional benefits during adolescence , such as improved academic abilities and cognitive function.3–6 Besides somatic advantages, participating in sports for adolescents fosters meaningful social networks, lowers the risk of criminal activity, drinking, and substance abuse.7–9 The levels of physical activity declines during early adolescence , and less than 20% are currently meeting recommendations for moderate -vigorous physical activity or sp orts participation.10 As adolescence is a period of increased autonomy, behaviors established during this period could potentially last into adulthood.11,12 Several barri ers exist to physical activity and sports participation during adolescence, such as the risk of injury and pain during activity. In line with this, l ower limb pain is the most frequent cause for seeking prima ry care during adolescence ,13 as 40% of active adolescents experience knee pain,14 and up to half of sports active adolescents regularly take pain medication for injury -related pain.15 In addition, almost a third of adol escents quitting their sport reports injuries or pain as the main reason.16 Osgood Schlatter affects up to 1 in 5 physically active adolescents and is the most common growth -related injury.17–21 The condition affects the knee, specifically the proximal tibial apophysis (the weakest part of the muscle -tendon -bone co mplex) .22,23 Osgood Schlatter can lead to long -term pain, swelling, and most notably , potential discontinuation of sports and physical activity, with potential sequela into adulthood.3,24 –32 Osgood Schlatter might also predispose to maladaptation in the maturing bone,33,34 inhibition of muscle activation,35 or more serious traumat ic knee injuries, such as tendon -avulsion and ligament tear.29,36,37 Increased loading from sports participation seems to be a trigger as adolescents who practice more have a higher rate of Osgood Schlatter.38 Data have also shown that adu lts who suffered sports -related injuries during youth are prone to musculoskeletal problems and poor health and having suffered knee pain before adulthood increase the risk of chronic pain later in life.39,40,41 In addition, i nvestigations into longstanding knee pain in adolescence ha ve shown that suffering from knee pain is related to lower quality of life, general health , and sports participation.31,42 Research into Osgood Schlatter and other lower limb apophysitis is only just emerging despite its first documentation in 1903.43,44 Only trial s on injection therapy exists, and the recommended types of modali ties for conservative management of Osgood Schlatter is abundant and conflicting in the literature , reflecting the lack of evidence in this area for first -line conservative treatments .43,45 –50"

Page 8 of 75 The notion that adolescent knee pain is self -limiting with a favorable prognosis i s widespread but recent data suggest this is not the case , as even when treated, it can be long -lasting.42,45,47,51 –54 This presumpti on might partly explain the state of the current management of Osgood Schlatter , being characterized by a wealth of advic e, from total cessation of sport, participation under the pain -limit, play -through -pain, wait -and-see, and cast-immobilization; to pass ive therapies such as shockwave therapy, ultrasound therapy, laser therapy, injections, surgery, vitamin -supplements, cryotherapy, dry -needling, massage, stretches, and manual manipulations.31,43,45 –47,49,55 –58 Need for a trial This highlights the need for an effective conservative management approach. Our group rec ently published data from a cohort of adolescents with patellofemoral pain who received an intervention based on a self - management approach containing g radual exposure to sports and physical activity using a guidance tool based on pain response and progres sive exercise therapy.59 This was associated with a 86% rate of successful outcomes a fter 12 months, with 81% being back to sport and physical activity, and 67% being pain -free.59 In line with this, our group explored a similar intervention in a smaller cohort of adolescents with Osgood Schlatter and had comparable promi sing results.60 With our current knowledge, a robust comparison of our novel approach to a standardized usual care treatment package in a well -powered randomized setting is highly warranted. This would also require a mapping and synthesis of the curr ent usual car e practice as no standards exist . Review of the current literature We have performed a basic systematic literature review on trials in adolescents with Osgood Schlatter to ensure that the trial is not redundant or wasteful .61 We searched MEDLine, CENTRAL and EmBase using t he search ter ms: (‘osgood’ OR ‘schlatter’) in June 202 1. A systematic review that evaluated interventions for Osgood Schlatter was found, concluding , “Carefully controlled studies on well -described treatment approaches are needed to establish which conserv ative treatme nt options are most effective for patients with OSD ”.62 In addition, three trials are re gistered on c linicaltrials.gov . One aims to evaluate cast immobilization with complete rest (completed 2016) , another myofascial massage over usual care (currently recruiting), and a third comparing stretching with cryotherapy, NSAIDs, and relative rest (l ast updated 2013) . Therefore, the rationale and scientific justification for this trial, remains."

Page 9 of 75 Primary aim The primary aim is to in vestigate the effect of 3 months of a novel treatment approach compared to standardized usual care after 5 mont hs, measu red on the KOOS -child ‘Sport/rec’ subscale, in adolescents with Osgood Schlatter. Research question Therefore, we propose the followin g research question: Is a novel 3 month treatment approach superior to standardized usual care for improving patient -reported knee function after 5 months in patients with Osgood Schlatter? Our research question fulfills the FINER -criteria, as it is considered both Feasible, Interesting, Novel, Ethical and Relevant.63 These criteria are important when attempting to optimize features of trial design to maximize the usefulness of clinical trials.64–66 The research question is based on the PI COT model with the following denotations for each item: Population: 10-16-year -old adolescents with Os good -Schlatter Intervention: 3 month of a novel treatment approach Comparator: 3 month of s tandardized u sual care Outcome: Patient -reported knee functio n on KOOS -child ‘Sport/rec’ subscale Time frame: Primary endpoint after 5 months Objectives This tria l has several objectives that have been outlined according to the SMART -model (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time Bound )67 in table 1. Hypothesis The hypothesis for the primary aim, is that the mean KOOS -child ‘Sport/rec’ subsc ale change score at month 5 is larger for the novel treatment approach compared to standardized usual care in adolescents with Osgood Schlatter."

Page 10 of 75 Secondary aims • Compare secondary and tertiary patient -reported, clinical and objective mea sures of improvement and adverse effect , also at secondary timepoints at 3 months, and at long -term follow -up after 8, 10, 12, 24 , and 48 moths (table 5). • Supply detailed trajectories of treatment response by collecting weekly self -reported measures and data from activity se nsors during the entire 5 month study period using visualizations and mixed effect analysis models . • Explore factors associated with effe ct moderation or mediation to determine who will possibly benefit more or less of treatment, and the possible mechanisms responsible. • Investigate the experience of undergoing the intervention and identify potential barriers or facilitators to treatment and adherence . • Evaluated features and procedures of the trial to assess operational feasibility Timepoints The primary and secondary fixed endpoints are chosen based on the fact that our previous cohort had trajectories of pain, knee -function , and sports par ticipation that were not fully recovered at 12 weeks,60 and that some participants had not progressed fully through the exercise regime. Thus, we decided to add a period of complete self -management by adding 2 months to the timeline before the primary endpoint . We have found this alteration to be feasible in clinical practice.68 This will also allow the novel treatment approach to work in a real self -management setting , rather than only during the course of the supervised treatment .

The full clinical trial protocol is based on the PREPARE Trial Guide and follows the reporting items from the SPIRIT checklist in th e order proposed by the Trials Protocol Template, and is supplemented by items from the WHO protocol recommendations ; the Danish Committee on Health Research Ethics, and the Transparency Checklist.1,2,69 –72 The reporting of the results will adhere to the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Repo rting Trials ) guidelines for reporting a) parallel group randomized trials, b) extension for pragmatic trials, and c) non -pharmacologic treatment interventions.73,74 Description of interventions follows current best -practice guidelines for reporting exercise -based interventi ons.75–77 The trial procedures will adhere to non -pharmaceutical standards of Good Clinical Practice E6(R2).78 The embedded Statistical Analysis Plan will follow recommendations from the PRE -SPEC framework (P RE-SPEC cification of stat istical analysis strategies in clinical trial s)79 complemented with guidelines from the EMA (E9), JAMA, and field guidelines.80–82 Analytic al code for the primary outcomes will be share d along the primary publication .83 Data will be reported in sufficient detail to allow inclusion in potential future meta -analyses.84 To increase the transparency, validity , and robustness of the trial, we have post ed this protocol as a"
12,page_12,"Pre-print of the SOGOOD trial protocol. H -21028912. Version 1.2, last updated 30-DEC-2021. Not peer reviewed. Page 13 of 75 timestamped pre -print publication to the Clinical Trials.gov repository before commencement of data collectio n as a supplementa ry to the registr ation (NCT05174182 ). However, sections describing the contents of the experimental intervention ( and supple mentary leaflets and precise descriptors) have been uploaded to the Figshare repository under embargo until primary publication to prevent premature uptake of the experimental intervention until data on its efficacy is established (10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5730008.v1 ). Therefore, some SPIRIT items ( 6b, 11a-d, 30 ) are not completely adhered to in this protocol. Pre-registration and pre -print publication of protocols ensures greater adherence to a priori decisions regarding data collection and analyses and is thus associa ted with higher dissemination rate85,86 and lower risk of bias.87 In addition, it appears to address prevalent QRPs (Questionable Research Practices)88,89 and produce more conse rvative estimates90,91 and increased rate of null -findings.92–94 We chose features of trial design based on the following: Superiority framework: As our preliminary stud y60 has shown promising results for patients having tried other treatments and with a significant duration of symptoms, we hy pothesize that the experimental intervention is superior , and the tria l design and analyses -plan reflects this hypothesis , e.g. by utilizing one - sided hypothesis testing for statistical analysis . Two -group parallel -arm design: This design was chosen as th e design is simple and therefore easier to understand for patients and clinicians, is simple to include in meta -analyses, has higher external validity than other designs, and incurs fewer statistical issues.95 Pragmatic framework: Using the PRECIS -2 tool (P Ragmatic -Explanatory Continuum Indicat or Summary) for categorizing our trial, we found our design to be most ly pragmatic (score 38 of 45) in terms of clinical domains (figure 6, table 9), making the potential results fit for real -world implementation with high ecological validity.96 This is in line with our own successful implementation of the interv ention in the clinic.68 Some domains, in terms of follow -up and adherence measuring, are more explanatory in nature, making these features less fit for a clinical setting.96,97 Patient involvement Osgood Schlatter patients undergoing treatment in our department have been involved in discussions of th e design of this trial in relation to their visits at the department, which have both informed and changed initial decisions regarding tri al design. In an unstructured open manner, patients have been asked about their preference, acceptability , and other i nputs, mainly regarding 1) number and duration of appointments during an intervention , 2) duration of the entire intervention , 3) type of outcomes relevant for them , 4) contents of the experimental intervention , and 5) relevance and importance of the resea rch question and comparisons, and have thus provided a valuable basis for this protocol which could lead to increased"

In addition, following the analysis, new patients will be invited to discuss the interpretation of the results of the trial, as well as dissemination aspects , and receive compensation for their inputs . Relevant public and clinical stakeholders will be engaged in a possible implementation process once dissemination via peer -reviewed journal publication is completed. Embedded pilot study We will have the first 15 participants act as pilot -participants. This will not incur any additional burden to participants or change their e xperience or procedures in any way compared to the current intended setup , but trial personnel will record extra data during months 0-3 on the pilot obje ctives (table 3). Pilot studies are the best way to assess the feasibility of a large, expensive full -scale study and avoid any adverse consequences or unforeseen pitfalls during the large -scale trial, and ensure that all the different components work toge ther.99–101 If the aim and features of the pilot trial is aligned with the main trial and participant data are deemed compatible, their data be included in the analysis of the main tr ial.100 The key difference from a pilot study and the main study are feasibility objectives and criteria for success that should reflect an operational perspective and aim but otherwise run as a miniature version of the main study.99,101 –103 If the pilot study results in the inclusion of data from pilot -participants data in the main study analyses and we also amend trial procedures, the amendments will be reported with justifications in the main report. In line with this , we have posed 4 possible outcomes (table 2) of the pilot study, based on the below criteria (table 3). Table 3.

Page 15 of 75 Embedded qualitative study A qualitative study is nested in the trial to understand barriers and facilitators to adhering to the interventions and describe the participant -perspective of undergoing the interventions as a whole. Ten interviews will be performed with 5 participants f rom each group . We expect that this number of participants will be sufficient to reach data saturation. Interviews will be face -to-face or by telephone and will take approximately 20 -40 minutes. All interviews will be conducted by a researcher trained in qualitative research and will be based on the semi -structured method with open questioning. Interviews will be recorded and afterwards transcribed verbatim. Participants will be emailed the transcript and asked to correct any errors. During analyses , the tr anscripts will be anonymized. Interviews will be analyzed for themes and as a narrative description of the experience of undergoing the interventions. The reporting will follow the JARS –Qual standards (Journal Article Reporting Standards - Qualitative Rese arch Design).104 Methods: Participants, interventions, and outcomes Study setting {9} All trial -related procedures will take place at Hvidovre Hospital, Capital Region, Denmark. Participants will attend procedures r elated to enro llment, imaging , and end -of-study visits at the Department of Orthopedic Surgery, while visits pertaining to intervention delivery and clinical outcome assessments will be performed at the Department of Physiotherapy, located adjacent to the latter. Key i nclusion and exclusion criteria {10} The diagnosis of Osgood Schlatter will be made by a trained physiotherapist according to the following diagnostic criteria:105 ▪ Insidious onset of pain or swelling of the tibial tuberosity for ≥6 weeks provoked by at least 2 of the following positions or activities; prolonged sitting or kneeling, squatting, running, hopping/jumping, stair walking , or during multidirectional sports ▪ Tenderness on palpation of the tibial tuberosity or pain during resisted isometric knee extensions Adolescents aged 10 -16 fulfilling these criteria at enrollment and report h aving either 1) markedly reduced sports participation , or 2) are severely affecte d by pain during participation during the past (representative) 6 weeks, w ill be eligible for inclusion. This will be assessed by having potential participants answering two pres -specified questions on th ese two domains."

Other reports from patients or the literature suggest even more variation in approaches.31,43,57 We have therefore performed a step -wise mixed -methods sub -study (figure 1) to investigate current standard of care in the most common settings in Denmark (Sports Physiotherapists mainly from private primary practice, and Orthopedic Surgeons caring for these patients invited from all public secon dary care orthopedic departments in Denmark). Results were the n combined with reports from patients seen in our clinic (n=34) who were questioned in detail on what mo dalities and advice they had previously received.111 The results were mostl y compatible with the recent international survey of clinicians treating Osgood Schlatter.58 With the findings from this process , we have developed a patient -aimed leaflet, which will contain vignettes and elaborations of the multimodal approaches included in the standardized usual care package ( figure 1), which will be impleme nted through four visits (at months 0, 1, 2, 3) with a physiotherapist (mirroring the plan of care of the experimental group)."

Page 20 of 75 Experiment al intervention: A novel treatment approach (Arm 1) {11a} Rational e and scientific background The experimental intervention was first comprised and tested in a large cohort of 10 -14-year -old adolescents with a similar condition (patell ofemoral pain) and was associated with a successful outcome after 12 weeks.59 Afterwards, the interventi on was changed slightly to target adolescents with Osgood Schlatter and then pilot -tested in a cohort of 51 participants.60 In this cohort, most participants needed more time to progress through exercises and sport, and we have therefore piloted extend ing the intervention further in the clinic, with more success on these as pects.68 We have also found that adolescents with Osgood Schlatter had markedly decreased strength in knee extension and hip abduction compared to a control group or even to a group of adolescents with patellofemoral pain.112 Exercises with pain have been shown superior to pain -free exercises in short -term mana gement of chronic pain,113, and pain of up to 5 NPRS is usually to lerated in exercise programs for tendon -related conditions in adults .113,114 Exercises with pain is a safe and effective way to increase gradual tolerance to loading activities and to decrease pain -response by inducing hypoalgesia and mitigating central and peripheral sensitization.115,116 It has also been shown that exercise as a modality is effective for pain -related bel iefs, such as kinesiophobia (fear of exercise), pain self-efficacy, and fear -avoidance behavior.117,118 In adolescents with knee pain performing simple knee extension and flexion, increased kinesiophobia seems to necessitate additional neurological resources to compensate for pai n-disrupted processing.119 Experimental studies have shown reductions in pain sensitivity after exercise,120,121 including dynamic (concentric and eccentric contractions) and isometric resistance training.121 Just a few weeks of res istance training can improve pain and function in musculoskeletal pain conditions,122 and seems superior to other non-pharmacological modalities.123 Patella tendon pain or damage can lead to quadriceps inhibition,35 a disorder that responds well to resistance training.124 In addition to being an appropriate and safe modality for Osgood Schlatter, strength training also carries a wealth of other health and performance benefits ,125–133 especially for adolescents.134 In line with this, isometric exercises with a long time under tension (10 -30 s) can be a good initial loading mode as it allows a high exerc ise volume with lower peak joint forces and has been shown to improve tissue quality in the patella tendon, induce strength and hypertrophy,135,136 whilst allowin g athletes to continue their sports participation.135,137,138 Short rest periods ( ≤30 s) stimulates metabolic load and results in lower mechanical load and are, therefore, a safe and effective way to promote adaptations through anabolic/metabolic pathways.139,140 Moreover, tendons have high collagen turnover during adolescence,"
20,page_20,"Pre-print of the SOGOOD trial protocol. H -21028912. Version 1.2, last updated 30-DEC-2021. Not peer reviewed. Page 21 of 75 with no turnover in the remaining lifespan;141 and especially the distal part of the patella -tendon is susceptible to adaptations from exer cise.138 This highlights the need for a healthy stimulus during this phase of maturation. Taking away the pain -evoking stimuli of loading from sports and vigorous physical activity while simultaneously introducing high volume exercise i s ther efore likely a key to allow subsequent gradual exposure to sports more successfully. The guidance through the return -to-sport process will be based on the clinical e xposure therapy , which is defined “by repeatedly and systematically approaching stimu li tha t trigger pain -related distress or symptom preoccupation is counteracted, and the participant will gradually gain an increased tolerance to pain and pain -related distress”142 and aims to stop or slow the cycle of preoccupation with symptoms, avoidance behavior, and pain. Exposure -based interventions are particularly effective in reducing pain -related fear and the perceived harmfulness of physical activity, also by challe nging catastrophic interpretations of movements or activities.143–147 Adolescents thus have to self -manage the dose of exercise and loading from sports and phy sical activity through the NPRS, putting decision -making on regression/progression in their hands. A self -management approach aimed at behavior -change has been identified as key for patients to adapt when facing social, emotional , and physical challenges w hen su ffering from persistent musculoskeletal pain or pain disorders, and shifting the expectations of a cure to an active approach is central to continued management and is suggested to prevent long -term disability and pain.148–152 In addition, Pain Self -efficacy, that is the belief in one’s ability to manage and complete a task despite pain, seems to improve by employing self -management strategies.118 The approach also supports participants in the step -wise path towards reaching self - management mindsets - and behavior change .153 Incorporating the parents is important during the intervention , as data have shown parents’ protectiveness, catastrophizing, and mood is predictors of youth pain intens ity, unpleasantness, and catastrophizing.154 Further, parents play a critical role in managing pain i n their children and improving function.149 The intervention will be delivered with age -appropriate language and incorporate vignettes during adjunctive pain manage ment education.155,156 Arm A will therefore contain an active approach with self -management of load and progressive exer cise therapy, delivered through 4 one -on-one visits lasting approximately 20 minutes ( at months 0, 1, 2, 3 ) over 3 months with a physiotherapist and an accompanying leaflet with written and illustrated exercise description, and advice and informatio n."

Page 22 of 75 This intervention will also fit well with the high -value care recommendations for care in musculoskeletal pain and sports medicine.157–159 The contents of the experimental intervention ( and supplementary leaflets and precise descriptors) have been uploaded to the Figshare repository under embargo until primary publication to prevent premature uptake of the experimental intervention until data on its efficacy is established (10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5730008.v1 ) Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated inter ventions {11b} If scheduling or the availability of equipment hinders the participant from following the exercise dosage, the treating physiotherapist will , together wi th the participant , try to amend the programme to better suit the preferences and contex t of the participant while still aiming for the correct dose and form in accordance with the original approach to the fullest extent possible. Intervention adherence {11c} Making exercises enjoyable, social , and convenient has been identified as the most likely barriers to exercise adherence in adolescents with musculoskeletal pain.160 In line with this, the exercises prescribed in both groups are designed to be performed with only little if any exercise -equipment and are time -efficient (1 - 20 minutes per day/every other day). We also encourage the participants to attend their regular s ports team practices and perform the exercises in that environment, rather than potentially skipping practice altogether , and thereby gaining a social aspect of performing the exercises.161 In both groups, the intervention personnel will remind participants to adhere to their respective intervent ions at visits at months 0, 1, 2, and 3. Reminders will firstly focus on the importance of adhering to dose and form of exercises and to the advice o n load ing by their own autonomy.161 Secondly, the personnel will engage participants in potential context -based barriers to adherence and foster rea listic expectations. Through weekly monitoring , participants are asked about their adherence to exercise and other group -specific modalities the past week . Also, we ask if they have currently returned to sports participation. In addition to weekly reports on adherence, participants will be asked at visits at months 1 and 3 about their current exercise dose and to demonstrate the exercises, which will then be rated by the observing therapist on a standardized form . To ensure honest answers regarding adherenc e, data from weekly monitoring will be unavailable to the treating physiotherapist, and the participant will be informed of this blinding at enrollment. Capturing detailed adherence of participants will allow post -hoc interpretation of the study results be yond the intention -to-treat approach.162"

We do not expect a high occurrence of concomitant treatment, but if this should occur, we will explore potential post - hoc moderat ion or subgroup analysis to better understand this aspect and its i mplications on the results of the trial. Participants will be instructed to not take any pain medication on the same day of testing to ensure that this does not affect any measurements . No post -trial treatment is planned.

Page 25 of 75 Primary outcome KOOS -child ‘Sport/rec ’ subscale The primary effect of the intervention will be evaluated using the KOOS -child (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score – Child), designed sp ecifically for adolescents and youths aged ≥10 experiencing knee problems.166 The KOOS -child contains 5 independent subscales with domains ‘Pain’ (11 items), ‘Symptoms’ (7 items), ‘Activities of Daily Living’ (11 items), ‘Sport/rec’ (7 items), and ‘Qu ality of Life’ (6 items). The questions are answered on Likert scales from 0 to 4 points and pertains to the prior week. The scoring of each subscale is normalized to a 0 -100 score , 0 being extreme symptoms and 100 being no symptoms. Four subscales (exclud ing ‘Activities of Daily Living’ due to low responsiveness68,1 12) will be recorded and presented, but the subscale ‘Sport/rec’ will be prioritized based on study aims and feedback and preferences from patient representatives and will thus provide properties for sample size calculation. The four included subscales have low detectable change on the group level (1.86 -2.66 points), acceptabl e standard error of measurement (5.69 -8.14 points), and substantial/near -perfect test -retest reliability ( ICC 0.78 -91). Secondary and tertiary outcomes Patient Acceptable Symptom State The question pertaining to Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS) is designed in collaboration with patient representatives. The recall period will be one week, and the outlook period a ‘few months’ as in previous applications in musculoskeletal con ditions with fluctuating symptoms.167 The phrasing of the PASS will be (approximate English translation): ”If you consider your knee pain during the past week, and how it affects your ability to do activities of dail y living (for example participating in school, in sports, and socially), woul d you consider your current symptom state acceptable for the next few months?”. The proportions of yes/no in each group will be captured and compared at designated time points . KOOS Child ‘Quality of Life’ , ‘Symptoms’ and ‘Pain’ subscales The above subsca les will be collected and change scores compared in the same manner as the primary ‘Sport/rec’ subscale. Frequency and intensity of pain flares A pain flare in this study is def ined as any time a participant reports pain of NPRS ≥4 through weekly monitor ing. As an outcome, a 4 -week average of number of pain flares during week 18-22 (frequency of pain flares) and the worst pain the past week at week 22 (intensity of pain flare) will be calculate d and compared.

Finally, participants will rate their problems with Pain/Discomfort in the 3 -point Likert EQ-D5-Y. Participation in sports and physical activity According to WHO recommendations , a daily minimum of 60 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA, such as biking, running/exercising/ high -intensity training ) is needed to stay healthy for 5 -17-year - olds.169 Thus , being at eith er under or above this cutoff during a 4 -week average from week 18-22 will be assessed, in addition to a continuous comparison between the two groups of minutes of MVPA during the same time period. Sel f-reported levels of physical activity are highly under -reported from trials -participants, and sensors increase the precision.170 Minutes of MVPA will be captured using waterproof threeaaxis 12 Hz accelerometers (SENS®, Copenhagen, Denmark) applied once to the participant’s thigh during the enrollment visit using an adhesive patch (35 cm2, 8 g). The sen sors have shown 92±5% discriminate agreement when distinguishing between different activities (light sleep, deep sleep, lying/sitting, standing, sporadic walking/slow biking, walking, biking, running/exercising/ high -intensity training).171 Physical activity data will also allow posthoc analyses of exposure. In addition to physical activity, the level of participation in sports will be captured t hrough weekly monitoring . Participants will be asked if the y have been participa ting in sports in the preceding week and for how many hours . Return to sport time will be defined as the first week participating in sports, followed by one more week also with sports participation. Participants will also be asked durin g clinical visits if their return to sport was at their pre -injury level or less/more and if they are satisfied with the current extent of their sports participation. Morpholo gy Involv ement of the tendon is common in patients with Osgood Schlatter,172,173 and associated signs of bursitis and severity have shown to be prognostic of a worse outcome.32 A series of Osgood Schlatter patients has been described for whom less hyperemia on color doppler ultrasound was associated with milder symptoms.105 Hyperemia on color doppler ultrasound (ad modum modified Öhberg 1 -4) will therefore be assessed for the patella tendon and tibial tubercle ( yes/no ) at baseline , month 3, month 5, and month 8. High inter -rater reliability of color doppler evaluations in the patella tendon has been established ,174, and we are currently investigating the reliability and clinical relevance of the full ultrasound protocol being"

Firstly, by rating the pain level after performing the Anterio r Knee Pain Provocation test (we have recently shown this tes t to be associated with KOOS ‘Sport/rec’ and NPRS , and response over time for adolescents with knee pain ).175 Secondly, by a NPRS 0 -10 rating from performing the maximal isometric knee extension strength test and the countermovement jump (mean of three trials). Thirdly, by manual palpation of the tibial tubercle for known pain (y/n). Finally, t o evaluate local hy peralgesia , specifically at the tibial tubercle, we will use handheld algometry to detect the pressure (kPa) needed to evoke pain (going from no pain to the slightest sensation of pain) on the tibial tubercle on both knees. The intra -day and intra -tester r eliability has been found to be >0.98 (ICC 3.1) for two similar sites; the center of the patella and the muscle belly of the tibialis anterior in young a dults with longstanding knee pain.176 Knee function Knee pain is known to reduce muscle function.177 To evaluate the capacity of the quadriceps femoris muscle inserting at the site of pain , handheld dynamometry wil l be used to measure maximal isometric force generation , which will be normalized to body weight and le ver-length (Nm/kg). This test has shown inter - tester reliability of ICC: 0.76 -0.96178,179 with a low standard error of measurement (5 -11%)179 and good validity compared to the gold standard of isokinetic strength assessment.178,180,181 We have recently investigated the inter -tester reliability of this test in an Osgood Schlatter cohort and found acceptable reliability .182 As a measure of power and a sports -specific skill, a countermovement jump will be performed to record jump height (cm) and power -production (watts) , using high -speed video analysis via a smartphone app (My Jump 2) . The test has been found feasible in adole scents,183 been validated against the gold standard of using a force -plate,184–186 and is highly relia ble.184,186 –189 Adolescents with Osgood Schlatter have been reported to have tighter knee -extenso r muscles, but it’s unclear if this is thought to be a contributing cause or derived effect or if this is merely is a characteristic of increased musculoskeletal maturation.38 We will compare the change in knee flexion angle , assessed by smartphone -inclinometry during a modified Thomas Test . Different apps based on the standard smartphone level -function have been investigated with near -perfect validity with other digital methods (video -analysis, digital inclinometers) an d with good to excellent inter -and intra -tester reliability and low error of measurement and detectability .190 However, w e will utilize the built -in level app in iPhone 7 (Apple, USA) as the apps investigated in the literature are no longer available for download .

Page 28 of 75 acceptable reliability.182 Global rating of change To assess patient -assessed improvement or worsening, we will ask participants to rate their perceived level of change from their first visit on a 7 -point Likert scale ranging from ‘Much worse’ to ‘Much better ’. GROC - scales have been found to have sufficient reproducibility and responsiveness.191 Usual Activities We will ask participan ts to rate their problems with an important activity using the Patient -Specific Functional Scale. They are asked to name a single important activity of their own choosing . Participants then rate their functional limitation with activity on a 0 to 10 scale, where 0 corresponds to being unable to perform activity and 10 is being able to perform activity at same level as before knee pain. At follow -up assessments , participant s are asked to rate the previously nominated activity on the same scale.192 For other conditions, the PS -FS has shown to be valid, reliable, and responsiv e.193 In addition, the EQ -D5-Y question on problems w ith ‘Usual Activit ies’ will be collected. Pain Beliefs To capture the level of kinesiophobia, that is, the fear of pain due to movement or exercise, a type of fear- avoidance behavior, the patient -reported 17 -item Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK -17) will be used.194 The instrument has good reliability and validity,195,196 and has demonstrated good psychometric properties when used by adolescents.197 Self-rated Health Recent studies have shown that self -rated adolescent health is associated with death, multimorbidity, primary care utilization, medicine use, social welfare benefits,198–201 as well as persistent musculoskeletal pain.202 Self-rated health will be collected through the 0 -100 VAS for general health. The EQ-D5-Y question s pertaining to ‘Self -care’ and ‘Mobility’ will be omitted due to low responsivenes68 and the question on ‘Anxiety/depression’ will only be used for mediation/moderator analysis and baseline descriptives . Our application of the questions on ‘Usual Activities’ and ‘ Pain/discomfort’ is described early in this section. Test - retest reliability of the EQ -D5-Y has shown a percentual agreement of 70 -99%.203 Serious and non -serious adverse events The potential occurrence of adverse events (AEs) in either treatment group will be reported as amount and proportions, and described in prose regarding severity, timing , and duration .204 If sufficient data is observed"

A telephone consultation with the treating physiotherapist is planned for month 2 (week 9), that can also res ult in a clinical visit if needed. Two months (9 weeks ) after end-of-treatment, participants will attend the primary clinical follow -up visit at 5 months (22 weeks), followed by the final clinical visit at 8 months. Subsequently, long -term digital -only fol low-up will be captured at months 10, 12, 24, and 48. See figure 2 for detailed study -flow, and table 5 for the study schedule."

In absence of more robust populati on-specific data, we will utilize this 9 point difference as a target for effect detection. We consider this to be a meaningful change and a relevant between -group difference. This change als o exceeds the smallest detectable group -level change (2.66 points ) and the standard error of measurement (8.02 points).166 In order to detect such a change with a standard deviation of 16 points (from the n=16 sample), an α level (type I/false positive error rate) of 5% and power ( β-1, or probability of avoiding t ype II/false negative error rate) of 90%, 5 5 (54.8) participants per group would be needed based on an i ndependent one -sided t -test (R 4.0.2, Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria; RStudio 1.0.153, power.t.test package). To account for a po tential 15 % dropout rate59 a total of 130 participants will be included. Figure 4. E ffect size vs sample size plotted This will correspond to a 0.56 Cohens d 'medium' effect size at 90% power (figure 4). The smallest effect size reliably detectable will thus be >0.482 (Cohens d ‘small’ effect size) at ≥80% power (Jamovi 1.2.25, jpo wer module) , surpassing the trivial (<0.2) and small (>0.2) effect size thresholds. In the event of no dropouts and all 130 participants retained in the study, power is increased to 94.2%. We also consider this sample size to be operationally feasible with in the given timeframe and with the resources available to our group."

Based on historical patient flow and past studies in this population , the planned recruitment rate is expected to be around 10 -15 participants per month during non - holiday periods. Thus, inclusion is expected to l ast up to two years , from January 2022 to January 2024. First contact Accordingly, all 10 -16-year -old patients referred for potential Osgood Schlatter complai nts to the department from other hospitals or general practice, or having contacted the study director themselves, will be screened for eligibility by telephone by the study director before potential ly being invited to enrollment visit. Assignment of int erventions: allocation Sequence generation {16a} Participants will be allocated to either standardized usual care or the experimental intervention with a 1:1 allocation ratio. To perform adequate se quence generation, we will use The Robust Randomization A pp207 (RRApp v3.0.1, https://clinicalresearch -apps .shinyapps.io/rrapp/ ) for a computer -generate sequence in random sized blocks with no stratifications, extracted by a person not otherwise involved in the trial. Concealment mechanism {16b} To conceal allocation and prevent selection bias, the sequence w ill be implemented using sequentially numbered in sealed opaque envelopes. A person not otherwise involved in the trial will be given the randomization sequence and 65 envelopes containing a pap er reading ‘ group 1 ’ and 65 envelopes containing a paper readi ng ‘group b’. The paper is sandwiched between t wo black pieces of cardboard, making it impossible to see through even with strong under -lighting. The envelopes have been sealed with glue. They will then order and number the envelopes according to the orde r from the randomization sequence."

Page 33 of 75 Implementation of allocation {16c} During the study period, staff involved in data collection and analysis will be blinded to randomization sequence and block size . Only the personnel responsible for including particip ants will have the ability to view group allocation , but only after the participant is irreversibly included in the study and have been allocated to their group . Assignment of interventions: Blinding Who will be blinded {17a} Outcome assessors and the st atistician performing analysis will be blinded in every way to group allocation. To yield valid results from the trial, we will blind intervention -receivers (participants) to treatment allocation and contents of the intervention they are not receiving. Th is will be done by providing minimal information to participants about the contents of either intervention until after gr oup allocation, nor will they be informed if they are in the experimental ( Group A) or usual care group ( Group 1). The written and verb al information prior to inclusions will state that the two groups both contain first line treatment modalities such as di fferent advice and exercises, offered as current practice based on the most recent literature. One reason for not informing participan ts about the contents of the interventions is that knowledge about the actual content would increase the likelihood of co ntamination, as participant s might want to implement parts of one intervention into the other or vice versa, for example , by doing stre tches in addition to the exercises in the experimental group. This would contaminate the experimental intervention leadin g to a possible underestimation of the efficacy of the intervention in question. Secondly, by keeping participants blind ed to treatment allocation, the adverse effects, such as disappointment of not receiving one or the other intervention, could be avoided . This is important because these effects could negatively affect the outcomes, with a risk of an overestimation of the effect of the i ntervention in question. This blinding aspect of participants with minimal information about treatment contents will incr ease the validity of the results. We consider this blinding aspect ethically warranted , as firstly, no current standardized recommendat ions or best practice of care for Osgood Schlatter exists , and s econdly, there is a considerable variation in the current type and extent of treatment modalities offered for Osgood Schlatter patients.58,111 To minimize bias (performance - and verification bias), the intervention personnel will not be aware which, if any, of the two treatments is the experimental or the comparator, or if the trial is inves tigating superiority/non -inferiority/equivalence. Differ ent personnel will deliver each intervention and will not be aware of the contents of the intervention in the opposite arm. However, due to the nature of the"

Page 34 of 75 interventions, it is required that they ar e aware of the group allocation of participants in order to deliver their assigned i ntervention, and they also need to engage participants in conversations about their current pain and symptoms, and their level of physical activity and sports , in order to guide participants through their respective treatments . Blinding intervention personnel to group allocation and some outcomes is therefore not feasible and is not performed , but they will not have access to any data collected by the outcome assessor during clinical testing and ultrasound scanning, nor the patie nt-reported instruments. Procedure for unblinding if needed {17b} As the study director and the Medical Advisor is unblinded to group allocation , unblinding is not expected to be necessary during th e trial. Study personnel Intervention personnel will be 6-10 different trained physiotherapists, not be involved in other aspects of the trial . Personnel responsible for doing outcome collection will be 1 -2 physiotherapists, not involved in other aspects of the trial and will be blinded to group allocation. Personnel responsible for diagnosis, inclusion, end -of-study visit will be one physiotherapist (KK) and a potential trained replacement, who will not be blinded to either group allocation or outcome mea sures. The Medical Advisor will be a Chief Orthopedic Surgeon (PH), who will examine participants in need of a second opinion regarding initial diagnosis, AEs, or other sudden health deterioration in participants. A biostatistician (TK) blinded to group allocation in the dataset will perform the a nalyses . Study training The PI has extensive experience delivering the experimental intervention, with all the chosen clinical outcome assessments from previous trials,32,59,68,112,175,182,189 and clinical work in the target population. In addition, the PI have managed the process of constructing the usual care -intervention through investigation with clinical field experts.111 Therefore, the PI will train the other physiotherapists in the respective interventions and clinical outcome assessments. All personnel will be trained in the nature of contamination effect and be trained in how to avoid unblinding when engaging par ticipants."

Intention -to-treat analyses , that is, analysis according to group allocation , will be performed as the standard analysis strategy unless otherwise denoted, to 1) investigate the effectiveness of being offered the experimental intervention over usual care, and 2) to maintain the bala nce of known and unknown confounders from randomization. We will employ a similar analysis strategy for other ratio -interval scale outcome variables. For non -interval scale variables, d ifference s between groups will be analyzed by logistic regress ion mode ls, and non -normally distributed residuals for ratio -interval scale outcomes will be compared by non parametric boot strap tests. To supply detailed trajectories and inferences of treatment response over time , we will fit mixed -effects models for t he imagi ng outcomes ( months 0, 3, 5, 8); time -to-return to sport, weekly hours of sports participation, pain -flares , and sensor -based physical activity (weeks 0 to 22); clinical outcomes ( months 0, 1, 3, 5, 8 ); and remaining patient -reported outcomes ( mont hs 0, 1, 3, 5, 8, 12, 24, 48 ). Mean and SD values will be reported if data appear approximately normally distributed. If data are non - normally distributed, they will be presented as median and interquartile range (IQR). We will report 95% confidence intervals, ex act p -values to the third decimal, and discussions of minimal detectable change (MDC) and minimal important change (MIC) when relevant/possible. Frequency data will be reported as ""No. (%)"" . Our standard option for all variables, is to be analyzed with the highest resolution pos sible, meaning no collapsing or dichotomization to retain as much information as possible in the dataset. However, some assessor -dependent scales, such as ultrasound scoring of the (un-normal maturation -related ) fragmentation qualit y of the tibial tubercle bone, contains the potential values “none” (1), “unclear”, (2), “little”, or “apparent/extensive” (4). The same applies to some other ultrasound measures and clinical examination findings. Depending o n the distribution of responses into these categories, we might choose to exclude data from the “unclear” category or collapse the “little” and “apparent/extensive” categories if we estimate the number of responses to be too low to make meaningful inferences.

By default, we will not perform adjustments for multiple comparisons as we have arranged our hypotheses in a prioritized order, and we will also conduct and report hypotheses testing in this pre -specified order.164,212 We will however adjust for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni corrections when multiple tests are performed for outco mes within the same construct or objective (e.g. the effect of group on acute pain response during loading, measured through 2 different outcomes: pain [0-10 NPRS] during maximal isometric knee extension test, and pain [0 -10 NPRS] evoked from the Anterior Knee Pain Provocation test). Potential Covariates Previous studies have shown that overuse knee injuries, as well as injuries to the growth plate , in sports active adolescents are higher during peak height velocity and the year leading up to this point,213–217 which is thought to be primarily due to vulnerable growth -related condition s, such as Osgood Schlatter.213 This has been supported by data showing higher growth velocity for Osgood Schlatter patients than cont rols.218 The effect of either treatment for participants being enrolled during their peak height velocity ( -1.49 years to +0.99 years PHV offset219,220) is therefore expected to be modified negatively, compared to participants being either post peak h eight velocity or being more than 1 year before PHV . Similarly, reaching skeletal maturity either late or on average is a risk factor for developing Osgood Schlatter compared to early maturation.221,222 Based on algorithms for calculating anticipated age of peak height velocity,223,224 we will classify participants as early maturers (<10.94 years for girls and <12.64 years for boys), average maturers (10.94 -12.94 years for girls and 12.64 -14.64 years for boys) and late maturers (>12.94 years for girls and >14.64 years for boys).225 The severity of Osgood Schlatter has previously been classified through sonography ad modum Flaviis, ranging from stage 1 -4, with 4 being the most severe , and we have accordingly found this classification and"

Page 43 of 75 the signs of infr apatellar bursitis, to be a predictor of prognosis for Osgood Schlatter patients.32,173 We will therefore potentially include peak height velocity (pre and circa), maturati on timing (average and late), and Flaviis stage as covariates in the primary model. Other variables are prognostic for general adolescent knee pain (symptom duration, sex, pain intensity/frequency, symptoms of anxiety/depress ion, self-rated health) ,54 but not for Osgood Schlatter specifically, and thus these variables will only be potentially included in a post -hoc model. Interim analyses {21b} No interim analyses or stopping rules are planned , due to very low safety concerns and to preserve statistical power . Until the final patient has attended their month 5 visit, no early look or exporting of data will be done. However, an evaluation of feasibility outcomes will be performed after including n=15 participants to decide if potential study amendments will resu lt in these 15 participants being included in the primary dataset (see “ Embedded pilot study ” section). Methods for additional analyses (e.g. subgroup analyses) {20b} Besides the sensitivity analyses otherwise specified (covariate adjusted, mixed -effects, moderation, mediation), we will perform sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of the primary intention -to-treat analysis, to examine the effect of adherence according to the pre -specified compliance criteria (doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5730008.v1 ). As a supplementary analysis , we will perform per -protocol analyses with dropouts omitted . Handl ing of non-adherence and any statistical methods to handle missing data {20c} Multiple imputations will be used to handle missing data. Imputation m odels for missing variables will be fitted using linear or logistic regression models, with included independent v ariables that are believed to have the best predictive value for the given missing variable. Plans to give access to the full protocol, participant level -data and statistical code {31c} To increase transparency and dissemination, all statistical code and fully anonymized dataset will be shared to an open -access repository (such as YODA, Z enodo , or Figshare) with a digital objective identifier once all planned p ublications are accepted or published as pre -print.226,2 27 Publication -specific datasets will potentially be posted along with published manuscripts in line with journal policies. If full anonymity cannot be achieved by removing unique data and identifies, a synthetic dataset will be created , which will mimi c the original dataset by preserving the statistical properties and the relationships between variables.228 Specific"

Effect moderation and mediatio n Some subgroups of participants may have some common characteristics that determine their likelihood of improving outcomes, or whether they respond better or worse to any of the interventions. Moderation analysis will be based on dependent variables at bo th the primary timepoint at month 5 and also for the last clinical follow -up at month 8 . All potential moderator variables will be collected prior to randomization. Solely evaluating the effect of an inte rvention leaves the question of what the underlying mechanisms responsible for success are that can explain why the intervention worked. The contents of the intervention in this study targets such intermediate factors that lies in the causal pathway betwee n exposure to treatment and effect on the outcomes (figure 3). Figure 3. Visual example of mediator in the causal pathway Mediator variables will be collected after baseline and before month 5 , except for imaging variables which will also be analy zed with dependent variables from the month 8 timepoint.

Together, they also form the steering - and writing committee , which will oversee the trial and decide on authorships and assume stewardship of the data. No specific data monitoring comm ittee is convened. Adverse event reporting and harms {22} In our p ublished pilot -study60 and during pilot -testing the intervention in the clinic,68 we have not observed any adverse events suspected to be linked to undergoing the treatmen t, although this was not assessed in a systematically participants w ill be informed in writing and verbally about the blinding aspects and potential risks and discomforts of participati ng in the study prior to enrollment. As with usual activites, participa nts’ symptoms may similarly temporarily flare up during testing. Esp ecially the anterior knee provocation test is designed to provoke anterior knee pain symptoms , specifically. Also, the algometric pressure will inflict short -term low levels of pain when going from 0 to 1 on the numeral pain rating scale (0 being ‘no pain’ and 10 being ‘worst pain imaginable’) . The imaging used in the study is diagnostic ultrasound that uses high - frequency soundwaves, with no ionizing radiation exposure and no discomfort during the scan. Usual care sometimes consists of invasive therapies s uch as injections and surgery, or other painful modalities, such as shockwave or dry -needling , however, the treatments and advice in the in the current study are solely based on straps, cryotherapy , exercises, and advice and education, and no actual or serious or non -serious adverse events are expected.229 As such, the potential benefits (on the individual and public level) of the study far outweigh the potential risks. To assess potential or any suspe cted harms and adverse events (AEs), participants will be asked during all clinical visits and the telephone consultation at month 2, through open -ended questioning about any new symptoms or illnesses, accidents, reasons for care -seeking, and knee -related questions on pain, locking, swelling, discoloration, or clicking experienced during exercises or other trial -related procedures, whether it can be attributed to the treatment or not. In addition, Serious (grade 3 -5) unexpected side effects or serious AEs w ill be reported to the Capital Regional Ethics Committee in Denmark within 7 days after the study director has become aware of the incident. Serious AEs will be assessed by the study director and the Medical Advisor (PH) for possible relations with the ass essments and/or intervention to consider whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE can be caused by either. The study director will be notified of new AEs by personnel responsible for interventions or outcome assessments (at month 0, 1, 2, or 1 3) and will telephone the participant as soon as possible thereafter for further investigation ; or when consulting the participants in person at month 5 or 8 . When needed, the participant will be seen by the Medical Advisor"

Adver se events will be gra ded according to the severity on from Grade 1 -5 Using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adve rse Events (CTCAE) grading:230 1. Mild: Asymptomatic or minor symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; no intervention needed 2. Moderate: Minimal, local, or non -invasive intervention indicated 3.

Life-threatening consequences (i.e., immediat e risk of death); urgent intervention indicated 5. Death related to adverse event The occurrence will be reported according to the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences thresholds of occurrence ,231 however, the anticipated sample (n=130) wi ll only allow to inferences regarding very common or common harms: • Very common ≥ 1/10 • Common (frequent) < 1/10 AND ≥ 1/100 • Uncommon (in frequent) < 1/100 AND ≥ 1/1000 • Rare < 1/1000 AND ≥ 1/10000 • Very rare < 1/10000 Steps to minimize pain, risk, and inconve niences To minimize pain during testing, the participants are told that they can always abort the test if the pain is felt as ‘too muc h’ or they start feeling fearful or uncertain of their symptoms during testing, but are ultimately told that potential pain felt during testing are not harmful and will pass shortly, as is our experience from >1000 test s. During knee extension strength tes t, if the adolescent feels the metal of the gauge on their shinbone through the padding of the dynamometer, extra padding will be placed on the shin. During the algometric test, we will use an upper boundary of 1000 kPa not to cause any bruises if particip ants does not report pain at this level of pressure (corresponding to 1 newton/mm2 or 10 kg/cm2). Justification of risk s and drawbacks, and future therapeutic reward There are no anticipated severe risks or drawbacks. All potential risks and drawbacks h ave been described and are considered minimal , with potential benefits far outweighing these both on the individual participant level and the public level . The choice to include 10 -16-year -olds was made, as this is the age where Osgood Schlatter occurs. The current sample of adolescents will receive a state -of-the-art examination, treatment ,"

If the experimenta l intervention proves effective , it could easily be implemented in current practice, potentially benefiting the many adolescents suffering from Osgood Schlatter in the future. In addition, this study will uncov er the effect of the two different interventio ns on other central outcomes such as pain mechanisms, performance, tissue morphology, as well as potential prognostic factors and potential mechanisms responsible for success through mediation analysis. Finally , the long -term follow -up assessments will hel p clarify if the effects are sustained with a potential for better quality of life, disease prevention, health , etc. through increased participation in sports and physical activity. Compensation to patients No participants will receive reimbursement for their travel expenses related to participation in the study, nor will participants be offered compensation of any kind. During treatment at Hvidovre Hospital, the participants will be covered under the Danish P atient Compensation Act (LBK no 995 of 14/06/2 018, chapter 3 §19) (In Danish: Patienterstatningen), which is a scheme that deals with compensation claims of patients treated in the public health system in Denmark who has sustained an unintended or unexpect ed injury or harm.

The participant is asked to hold on to the othe r side of the be d behind them with both hands and keep their upper body upright . Before testing, the following instructions a given: “In this test, you must push a hard as you possible can, that is, 100% / maximum, from the moment I say “go” until I say “s top”. So, I am g oing to say “3 -1-2-go-press -press -press -press -stop.” We are doing 3 trials on each leg after a familiarization trial at appx 50% of your maximum effort. There is going to be 30 seconds between trials, and let me know if you feel any pain du ring testing.“ The assessor holds the leg in the starting position to allow full rest between trials. If the participant feels any pain during testing, they are asked to rate it on the NPRS. The position will be at 60º knee flexion and the angle of the be lt on the dynamo meter/shin will be 90º, both verified by handheld goniometry. This test has shown an inter -tester reliability of ICC: 0.76 -0.96 with a low standard error of measurement (5 -11%)179 and good validity compared to the gold standard of isokinetic strength assessment.180 The dynamometer used is a MicroFet 2 (Hoggan, Scientific L.L.C., Salt Lake City, USA) with a sampling rate of 100hz. The force (newtons) obtained from the dynamometer will be normalized to lever length (knee joint line to the point of fixation in meters) and body weight (kg) to allow appropriate comparisons between particip ants (Nm/kg).

The probe measuring 1 cm2 will be placed perpendicular on the pre -palpated tibial tubercle and pressure applied at appx 30 kPa/s. To minimize the risk of the probe sliding during testing, the skin is stretched to t he side. To avoid excessive pressure applied, 1000 kPa will be used as a safety threshold. Participants will be lying supine with a solid tube under the knee during testing, while at appx 20º knee flexion. The participants will be instructed to press the button as soon as the pressure evokes pain, which will alarm the as sessor to cease the application of pressure.

From here, participants will be instructed to lie back down and grab their index knee and hold it towards their chest, while the non -index leg is fully relaxed. In this position, the distal muscle belly of the quadriceps femoris is gently palpated and shaken to ensure there is no palp able tension. Then, by using a digital goniometer centered on the anterior tibial crest at the midpoint between the malleolus and the knee joint, the offset angle from horizontal is measured.

The protocol is performed on each knee at baseline , starting with the right knee . All positive findings will be documented , and the sonographs and videos saved in REDCap. The protocol consists of primarily longitudinal sonographs from the patella pole to the tibial tubercle. Although Osgood Schlatter is a condition of the tibial tubercle or the adjacent tissue, our clinical experience is that a sec ondary proxima l involvement of either the proximal patella tendon or the patella pole is not uncommon, and we have thus included measures within this region as well , to also assess these structures systematically at baseline. We will however only perform f ollow -up imagi ng for distal structures and for symptomatic knees. Some of the singular measures are contained in the classification systems. Thus, all singular measures collected will be (table 8): • Cartilage thickening of patella pole and the tibial tuber cle (Yes [1] o r no [0]) .105,240 –242 • Tendon thickening : thickening of the proximal patella tendon or dist al patella tendon: the subjective rating of the tendon appearing thickened (1) or not (0) .242,243 • Bursitis signs of the infrapatellar bursa: If the infrapate llar fat pad appears e ither with fluid build up or with hyperemia, raters will denote signs of bursitis (1), and none if nothing abnormal is detected (0).54,242 • Un-united ossicle : If the secondary ossification center or an ossicle (deemed as cortical bone, rather than a more irregular calcified fragment) appears unattached superficial to site of fusion of the metaphysis and physis on the tibial tubercle (1) or not (0) . 242,244 • Bone fragmentation of the patella pole and the tibial tubercle: subjective rating of the fragmentation qual ity of the bo ne surface (excluding normal fragmented/fissuring maturation -related appearance of the metaphysis -physis junction) as either unclear (0), none (1), apparent (2).240,242,244 Classification systems (table 7): • Severity ad modum Flaviis : We will use the Flaviis cumulative system to grade part icipants in severity -stages, as described in table 7, depending on swollen cartilage (1), swollen cartilage combined with a fragmented or hypoechoic outline of the ossification center, tendon thickening (3),"

The physiotherapist is a certified sonographer from the Danish Association of Sports Physical Therapy and has 3 months of experience performing the protocol in adolescents with anterior knee pain, primarily in Osgood -Schlatter patients. He has been trained and supervised in performing the protocol and interpreting the sonographs by a professor (JLO) in rheumatology specialized w ithin the field of using ultrasound as a diagnostic modality of overuse injuries in m uscle -tendon tissue. Ultrasound equipment, settings, and position Participants position: Participants will be seated in a resting position, halfway lying on their back with the headrest raised at approximately 70°, knees resting on a plint at about 30° knee flexion, and resting their feet on the heels. During color doppler assessment, partici pants will have their knees fully extended, and for evaluation of the infrapatellar bursa, the sonographer can choose to flex the knee to approximately 90° flexion at their discretion to acquire the best view and sonograph of a suspected positive finding. Participants will be able to co -view the sonographs during scanning."

Page 71 of 75 Rater position: During the scanning of both knees , the rater is seated next to the partic ipant, operating the probe with their right dominant hand. Probe placement: The probe is place d on the midportion of the patella tendon in the longitudinal/sagittal plane centered along with the continuity of the patella tendon. The probe is moved distal ly/proximally until the apex of the patella is in the proximal part of the sonograph. From here, the probe is moved distally until the tibial tubercle is in the middle/distal part of the sonograph , and measures are collected and rated along the way. All fi ndings are confirmed by performing sweeps in medial -lateral plane and transerval sweeps, and the rater saves the best representation of the finding on the longitudinal plane, potentially supplemented by transveral sonographs. During doppler evaluation , minimal pressure is applied to the probe , and a thick visible layer of gel is applied to not constr ict potential vessels. Equipment and settings: All ultrasound imaging will be captured using an Arrieta V70 (Hitachi, Japan) scanner and an L64 linear probe a t 18–5 MHz (Hitachi, Japan). In collaboration with a consultant from the equipment supplier , an optimized preset was made for the study allowing only changes in depth, gain and focus. The settings for the preset are as follows: • Depth: 2. 0 cm (usually adjus ted to 3.0 cm when assessing doppler) • Gain: 80 • Focus: 1 .1 cm • Doppler speed : 2.03 cm/s • Doppler fre quency : 10.42 MHz • CG: 140 • Placement of doppler ROI window: Anteriorly and maximized • Frequency : High (approximately 18 MHz)"

PRagmatic -Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary – PRECIS ‘Wheel’ Table 9. PRECIS -2 scores for trial domains Domain Score Rationale 1 Eligibility Criteria 4 Participants included will resem ble those that present in the clinic to a large degree , and concomitant complaints are also allowed to some degree. 2 Recruitment Path 4 As there are limited treatment options, participants are usually not contained in the health care system. For thos e that do seek treatment, we will supply nearby GP clinics and private physio clinics with contact information for potential participants. Similarly, near by sports clubs will be provided the same material. Moreover, all patients who are referred for specia lized care in the uptake area of our orthopedic department will be screened for eligibility. Finally, we will supplement the above recruitment channels wi th social media adverts for those that are not currently in the health care system, targeting 40-55-year-old (potential parents) in the uptake area. As such, we are attempting to potentially offer recruitment to the entirety of the local potential populati on. 3 Setting 3 The intervention and outcome assessments will take place at the physiotherapy depa rtment in the hospital. 4 Organization 4 The intervention is comprised by field experts, but the personnel trained to deliver the intervention will not have extensive experience with either the intervention or the target -population. Post -trial dissemin ation to other clinicians will consists of le aflets, intervention descriptions , and a clinician manuscript ."
