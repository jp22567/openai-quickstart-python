BACKGROUND Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide and ranks the third on the incidence of cancer -related death. There are more than 500 ,000 new cases diagnosed annually worldwide. The incidence and prevalence of HCC are on rising trend with the majority of the disease burden is in Asia where viral hepatitis B is endemic. (1) Surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and liver transplantation (L T) represent the only chance of cure for HCC patients. Despite more aggressive surgical approach has been adopted in most Asian countries, yet curative intervention s remain only amendable in 30% of patients. (2) Most patients are diagnosed with intermediat e or advanced stage diseases; the long-term cure rate is only 0 -10%. For those with inoperable disease, trans -arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the most widely used local therapy and is the standard of care for intermediate stage HCC. (3 -4) Our previous randomized trial is one of the landmark studies to demonstrate the survival benefit in these patients. (3) However, its efficacy is limited in those with large tumor burden and vascular involvement. Shim et al. reported the 2 -year survival of HCC patients receiving TACE is 42% versus 0% for tumor sizes of 5 -7cm and ≥ 8cm, respectively. (5) Tumor response is even more rarely seen in patients receiving oral multi - kinase inhibitors. (6 -7) To date, there is no effective down -staging strategy in unresectable HCC due to limited response of various therapeutic approaches . There is a huge unmet need for more effective therapy for locally advanced HCC. 1.1 SBRT Until recently, external radiotherapy has a limited role in the management of HCC. Stereotactic body radi otherapy (SBRT) has been introduced to treat liver malignancy since l990s. (8) SBRT refers to the utilization of a few fractions of a potent dose of highly conformal radiation with excellent geometric precision, therefore able to deliver tumoricidal dose t o the tumor while sparing the adjacent normal structures. Several prospective series have demonstrated that a local control rate of 87 -100% at 1 -year, overall survival of 60 -69% at 2 -year and limited toxicity. (9 -12) Data from literature and our group sugg ested that SBRT might offer a better response rate and more durable control than TACE in locally advanced HCC patients. Large - scale randomized phase III trial is ongoing in evaluating the combining SBRT and systemic therapy Sorafenib versus Sorafenib alone . (13) 1.2 TACE Plus SBRT Further, meta -analysis has demonstrated TACE plus radiotherapy (RT) are more therapeutically beneficial than TACE alone. (14) There are several reasons for the potential synergism between the two treatment modalities: RT can kill the residual cancer cells after TACE, especially those at the tumor periphery that remain viable through the blood supply from the collateral circulation (15); secondly, TACE damages large numbers of cancer cells, which promotes the residual cells from a n on-proliferative phase into cell proliferation, and thus become more radiosensitive (16); thirdly, TACE also decreases the tumor volume, which in turn reduces the radiation field and adverse events (17); in addition, the retention of"
8,page_8,"START -FIT v 4 (Date: 27 Apr, 2021) 9 chemotherapeutic agent s from embolization in liver tumor cells has a radio -sensitizing effect and accelerates tumor necrosis (18); finally, our group has reported the lip iodol enabled more accurate localization of HCC during SBRT. (19) Our team had reviewed 73 intermediate to a dvance d stage HCC patients who received a single dose of TACE followed by SBRT. T he median size of the tumor is 11.2cm , and 25% of them have the vascular invasion. The objective response rate (ORR) was 68%, the 1 -year local control (LC) rate was 93.6%, the median progression -free survival (P FS) was 7.2 months, and median overall survival ( OS) was 19.8 months. Twelve (16.4%) patients had treatment response were amendable for subsequent surgical resection , median OS was not yet reached for those who have operated. There was no patient developed radiation -induced liver disease (RILD) (20). Further, we also retrospectively compared the outcomes of TACE plus SBRT versus TACE in patients with intermediate HCC using propensity score matching (1:2). There was a sign ificant improvement in median OS after TACE+ SBRT when compared to TACE alone (23.9 months vs. 10.4 months, p<0.001). Also, there was a significant improvement of 3-year PFS (26.6% vs. 8.3%, p=0.03). (Unpublished data) In a recent ly published phase II rand omized trial, 90 unresectable HCC patients with vascular invasion were randomized to receive TACE+ RT versus Sorafenib; the TACE+RT was associated with significantly better 12 -week PFS rate (77.8% vs. 26.7%; p<0.001), median time to disease progression (30 weeks vs. 8 weeks; p<0.001), and median OS (55 weeks vs. 43 weeks; p=0.04) than Sorafenib alone. (21) Taken together, combined TACE and SBRT is a more powerful local treatment than TACE alone, yet distant control remains a key challenge for unresectable H CC patients. 1.3 Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICI) Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) represent another breakthrough in the management of advanced HCC patients. Preclinical data have shown that HCC’s tumor microenvir onment is immunosuppressive; (22 ) the o verexpression of inhibitory proteins PD -1 and CTLA -4 on the exhausted T -cells has rendered the checkpoint inhibitors a promising therapeutic option. (23 ) The first published report on checkpoint inhibition in HCC is a phase II trial using the CTLA - 4 inhib itory antibody tremelimumab. The trial enrolled 21 patients with hepatitis C –related cirrhosis. Among 17 evaluable patients, three (18.0%) had a partial response, and an additional 10 (58.8%) had stable disease, with a median time to progression of 6.5 mon ths. However, nearly half (45%) of all patients experienced grade 3 or higher toxicity, primarily transaminase elevations. Typical immune -related toxicities such as rash (65%) and diarrhea (30%) were common, but no patients required corticoste roid treatmen t for toxicity. (24 ) Later, the checkmate -040 phase I/II trial was recently published, among 214 of advance d HCC patients received anti -PD1 Nivolumab 3mg/Kg every 2 weeks, the objective response rate (ORR) was 20%, the median duration of response was 9.9 m onths, and the toxi city profile was manageable. (25) The favorable ORR and durability of response have lead to FDA accelerated approval of Nivolumab in HCC patients who have previously been treated with Sorafenib."
9,page_9,"START -FIT v 4 (Date: 27 Apr, 2021) 10 There is evidence of synergistic effect f rom the combination of immunotherapy regimes with SBRT. Radiation could induce immunogenic cell death and convert the irradiated tumor into an in -situ vaccine to prime the immune system fo r the checkpoint inhibition. (26 ) Pre -clinical data have demonstrate d that the combination of SBRT and checkpoint inhibition resulted in better local tumor regression and abscopal (out -of-field) effect when compared with the use of eithe r single modality treatment. (27 -28) Early clinical reports in melanoma and lung cancer patients have provided further support for the efficacy and safet y of this novel combination. (29-30). In the randomized phase III PACIFIC trial in stage III non -small cell lung cancer, patients were randomized to receive anti -PD-L1 Durvalumab or placebo after completion of chemo -radiation, the PFS was significantly longer in patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors (16.8 months versus 5.6 months, p<0.0001). (31) Based on our pilot work and the recent evidence, we propose a phase II trial to test the conc ept of combin ed TACE and SBRT followed by immune checkpoint inhibitor as a neo -adjuvant treatment in unresectable HCC patients. 2.

STUDY INTERVENTION 6.1 Investigational Product An investigational product, also known as investigational medicinal product in some regions, is defined as a pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a refer ence in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used for an unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form."
16,page_16,"START -FIT v 4 (Date: 27 Apr, 2021) 17 The investigational product should be stored in a secure area a ccording to local regulat ions. It is the responsibility of the Investigator(s) to ensure that investigational product is only dispensed to study subjects. The investigational product must be dispensed only from official study sites by authorized personnel according to local regulations. In this protocol, the investigational products is Avelumab for injection. 6.2 Non-investigational Product Other medications used as support or escape medication for preventative, diagnostic, or therapeutic reasons, as compo nents of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be considered as non -investigational product. 6.3 TACE 6.3.1 Procedure Procedure of TACE will be standardized . A femoral artery puncture will be performed under local anesthesia. Celiac and superio r mesenteric arterial and porto -venogram will be done to delineate arterial anatomy, to exclude main portal vein occlusion and to define size and number of tumor nodules. The right or left hepatic artery will then be super -selectively catheterized. An emul sion of a mixture of cisplatin (1mg/ml) with lipiodol in a volume ratio of 1 to 1 will be prepared. A maximum of 60ml (equivalent to 30mg of cisplatin) mixture will be injected slowly under fluoroscopic monitoring. The amount of mixture used will depend on tumor size, number and arterial blood flow. The aim is to deliver a sufficient amount of emulsion to tumor without ret rograde flow. In case of bi -lobed HCC or super -selective cannulation is not possible, the emulsion will be in jected to hepatic artery pro per that distal to origin of gastro -duodenal artery. This will be followed by embolization with gelfoam pellets of 1mm diameter mixed with 40mg of gentamicin. 6.3.2 TACE adverse event Common (60 -80%) Post-embolization syndrome (RUQ pain, nausea, fatigue, fever, ileus and transient raised of liver enzymes), usually self -limiting and recover within 7 -10 days Uncommon side effects (<5%) Hepatic decompensation, liver abscess, cholecystitis, bile duct injury, gastroduodenal ulceration and renal dysfunction"

SBRT can be commenced if there is no grade 3 or 4 toxicity , bilirubin ≤3.0 mg/dL, C hild Pugh score ≤7 and the treating physician recommends continuation. Otherwise, a delay in SBRT should occur until toxicities resolve. 6.4 SBRT SBRT screening and plannin g will be performed by radiation therapists, medical physicists , and oncologists. Treatment will be delivered by a 6MV/10MV linear accelerator at 4 weeks (or within 21 -35 days) after TACE 6.4.1 Immobilization and Simulation Patients will be positioned supine in an Alpha Cradle or equivalent immobilization device will be cu stom made for each patient. Treatment planning CT scans will be required to define gross tumor volume (GTV). Multi -phasic IV contrast is recommended for the planning CT (arterial phase and/or delayed phase imaging recommended for GTV delineation, and venou s phase for portal vein thrombosis d elineation). If oral contrast is used at simulation, similar timing and volume of oral contrast is to be used at the time of treatment. Breath -hold CT or average phase CT (from 4D -CT) may be used as the baseline CT for radiation therapy planning. All scans used for target delineation should be fused to each other so that the livers are registered to each other for target delineation. Registra tion will be performed with the best -fit liver -to-liver image registration, focus ing on the region of the PTVs if deformation or rotation occurs between scans. Breathing motion management is recommended if breathing motion is >5 mm. Motion ma nagement can be addressed using respiratory gating, active breathing control (ABC), or abdomina l compression . 6.4.2 Target volumes Gross tumor volume (GTV) is defined as HCC focus that is visualized on contrast imaging, usually best seen on arterial phase (as hyperintensity) or washout out at portovenous/ delayed phase. Clinical target volume (CT V) is defined as GTV with expansion to include th e lipodol stained area. Planning target volume (PTV) will provide margin around each CTV to compensate for respiratory motions. Individualized margin will be added to CTV to form the planning target"
18,page_18,"START -FIT v 4 (Date: 27 Apr, 2021) 19 volume (PTV) to compensate for respiratory motions. The margin recipe depends on the motion management solution utilized. Typically, a minimum PTV of 4mm around each CTV is required and the maximum permitted PTV is 20mm. 6.4.3 Dose Specifications Treatment Sched ule: Treatment will be delivered in 5 fractions. The time between fractions should be between 24 and 72 hours, with treatment delivered t o all targets over 5 to 15 days. Prescription Dose: Absorbed dose: 27.5 Gy - 50 Gy in 5 fractions. The prescription do se may be 50 Gy, 45 Gy, 40 Gy, 35 Gy, 30 Gy or 27.5 Gy in 5 fractions, based on normal tissue constraints. The minimal planned prescription dose to PTVs is 27.5 Gy. The dose to multiple PTVs may be different. The goal is to use the highest allowable prescr iption dose to the primary target, while respecting normal tissue constraints. Dose prescription is based on the volume of normal tissues irradiated (correlated with mean liver dose), as well as proximity of stomach, duodenum, small and large bowel (GI lum inal structures) to the target volumes, as normal tissue constraints must be maintained in this study. Dose Specification: The prescription isodose should encompass 95% of PTV. If there are multiple PTVs, each should be planned for one of the prescription doses listed above, with each specific covering isodose planned to encompass 95% of each PTV, with normalization to the PTV receiving the highest dose. The highest allowable doses to the target volumes that maintain normal tissue constraints should be used . A goal is that 100% of the CTV is encompassed by the prescription dose. Vascular tumor thrombosis (e.g., portal vein thrombosis) dose should be the same as the HCC prescription dose. However, lower doses are acceptable if required to maintain normal tis sue limits, since the cancer density may be lower than parenchymal HCC .

Must use tubing with in line, low protein binding 0.2 micron filter made of polyether sulfone (PES) during administration. The dose amount required to prepare the avelumab infusion solution will be based on the patient’s weight in kilograms (kg). All patients should be weighed within 3 days prior to dosing for each dose to ensure they did n ot experience either a weight loss or gain of >10% from the weight used for the last dose calculation. For weight change less than 10% the decision to recalculate the avelumab dose can be in accordance with institutional practice. If the patient experience d either a weight loss or gain >10% compared to the weight used for the last dose calculation, the amount of study drug must be recalculated. Any unused portion of the solution should be discarded in biohazard waste disposal with final disposal by accepted local and national standards of incineration. 6.5.3 Avelumab Administration Avelumab 10 mg/kg will be administered on Day 1 of each 2 -week study cycle. Avelumab may be administered up to 3 days before or after the scheduled day of administration of each cycle due to administrative reasons. Pre-medication: Avelumab will be administered as a 1 -hour IV infusion. In order to mitigate infusion -related reactions, a premedication regimen of diphenhydramine 25 to 50 mg IV or oral equivalent and paracetamol 500 mg IV or oral equivalent is mandatory approximately 30 to 60 minutes prior to each dose of avelumab. Setting: Avelumab should be administered in a setting that allows for immediate access to an intensive care unit or equivalent environment and administration of therapy for anaphylaxis, such as the ability to implement immediate resuscitation measures. Steroids (dexamethasone 10 mg), epinephrine (1:1,000 dilution), allergy medications (IV antihistamines), bronchodilators, or equivalents, and oxygen should beav ailable for immediate access. Observation period: Following infusions, patients must be observed for 30 minutes post - infusion for potential infusion -related reactions.

At each visit, patient’s performance status and toxicity of treatment will be monitored, and blood test will be checked for complete blood picture, liver function, renal function, clotting profile and alpha -fetoprotein (AFP). A urine or serum pregnancy test needs to be performed at least every month while the subject is on avelumab therapy . Free T4 an d TSH must be performed at least every 8 weeks during avelumab treatment and at end of treatment or 30 days post -treatment safety follow -up (if not performed in the previous 8 weeks ). Upon completion of intervention, patients will be seen at least every 4 months in the first two y ears, and then every 6 months. Blood -borne immune markers will be checked every 4 weeks for the first 2 4 weeks. Extended safety follow -up:  Given the potential risk for delayed immune -related toxicities, safety follow -up must be performed up to 90 days aft er the last dose of avelumab administration.  The extended safety follow -up beyond 30 days after last avelumab administration may be performed either via a site visit or via a telephone call with subsequent site visit requested in case any concerns noted du ring the telephone call."

This endpoint is to reflect the number of patients achieve complete tumor clearance and potentially cure.  Time to progression (TTP) : measured from the date of first study treatment to radiographica lly documented progression according to mRECIST 1.1. This does not include death from any cause."
38,page_38,"START -FIT v 4 (Date: 27 Apr, 2021) 39  Progression -free s urvival (PFS) : measured from the date of first study treatment to radiographically documented progression according to mRECIST 1.1 or death f rom any cause (whichever occurs first). Participants alive and without disease progression or lost to follow -up will be censored at the date of their last radiographic assessment.  Overall survival (OS): measured from date of first study treatment to the da te of death from any cause . Participants alive or lost to follow -up will be censored at the date of their last visit.  Quality of life (QoL) : as assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC -QLQ -C30) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy –Hepatobiliary (FACT -Hep) questionnaires  Safety outcome measures : Incidence, nature, and severity of adverse events graded according to the United States National Cancer Institute The Common Term inology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE 4.0 )  Pathological response : assessed as the percentage of surface with non -viable cancer cells (represented by necrosis or fibrosis, the ultimate stage of necrosis) in relation to the total tumor area and will be equal to: 100% – viable cancer cells (%).

Procedure: after collection of patients’ blood, the sample will be centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 rpm. After removal of the plasma, PBMC will be isolated either by Ficoll -paque or red cell lysis buffer. The isolated PBMC will be washed twice with PBS for immediate analysis or frozen for further investigation. For the phenotyping of the immune cells, PBMC will be stained with different antibodies and examined by flow cytometry. The identification of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells are defined as CD 8+ CCR7+ CD45RA+ and CD4+ CCR7+ CD45RA+, respectively. For the T -reg cell, we define as positive for CD4 and Foxp3. We will also examine the expression of Ki -67 and TIM - 3 in the T -cells to demonstrate the possible cell proliferation and functions. We will also examine the expression of PD -1 and PD -L1 expression on each subset of cell to correlate the pathological response and clinical outcome.  Tumor samples (immune -related markers in surgical specimens) The expression and spatial distribution of immune -related or response -related markers by immunohistochemistry may also include, but may not be limited to, PD -L1, CTLA - 4, CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO, forkhead box P3, granzyme B, OX40, PD1, cleaved caspase 3 and Ki67. 7.7 Safety Reporting 7.7.1 Adverse Events (AE) According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution. An adverse event can therefore be any of the following:"
40,page_40,"START -FIT v 4 (Date: 27 Apr, 2021) 41  Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product  Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a known condition)  Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline  Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other cli nical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation from study drug  Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those that occ ur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsies) 7.7.2 Serious Adverse events (SAE) A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:  Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event act ually causes or leads to death)  Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the Investigator (s), places the patient at immediate risk of death)  This does not include any adverse event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allo wed to continue, might have caused death.  Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life f unctions)  Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to study drug  Is a significant medical event in the Investigator (s)'s judgment (e.g., may je opardize the patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to pre vent one of the outcomes listed above) The terms “severe ” and “serious ” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteri a for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]; the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache without any further findings). Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event recorded in the cli nical database. 7.7.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI ) AESIs (serious or non -serious) are a subset of Events to Monitor of scientific and medical concern specific to the Merck Drugs in this protocol for which ongoing monitoring and rapid"
41,page_41,"START -FIT v 4 (Date: 27 Apr, 2021) 42 communic ation by the Investigator(s) to Merck Drug Safety is required. Such an event might require further investigation in order to characterize and understand it. Infusion related reactions including study intervention hypersensitivity reactions and immune - medi ated adverse reactions (immune -related pneumonitis, immune -related colitis, immune - related hepatitis, immune -related endocrinopathies (thyroid disorders, adrenal insufficiency, new onset type I diabetes mellitus, pituitary disorders), immune -related nephri tis and renal dysfunction and other immune -related AEs (myositis, myocarditis, Guillain -Barré syndrome, uveitis) have been identified as adverse events of special interest for avelumab. Any AE that is suspicious to be a potential immune -mediated adverse re action or infusion related reaction will be conside red an AESI . AESIs do not require expedited reporting unless they are serious. Should the AESI be serious, a SAE form should be filled instead and the reporting process for SAEs should be followed. 7.7.4 Pregnancy Reports Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the Investigator(s) if they become pregnant during the study. 7.7.5 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events Investigator (s) should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating “Yes” or “No” accordingly. The following guidance s hould be taken into consideration:  Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug  Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (as app licable)  Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments  Known association of the event with the disease under study  Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to increase the occurrence of the event  Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the occurrence of the event 7.7.6 Methods of Recording Adverse Events All AEs must be documented in the appropriate section of the CRF. An SAE report form (initial or follow up) must be completed in addition."
42,page_42,"START -FIT v 4 (Date: 27 Apr, 2021) 43 The following aspects must be recorded for each event in the CRF: A description of the AE in medical terms, not as reported by the subject;  The date of onset (start date)  The time of onset (start time)  The date of recovery (stop date)  The time of recovery (stop time)  The severity of the sign and/or symptom or clinically significant abnormal laboratory value according to NCI -CTC, Version 4.0. If no toxicity grade is described for a given sign, symptom or abnormal la boratory value, the Investigator(s) will grade the severity as mid (grade 1), moderate (grade 2), severe (grade 3), or life -threatening or disabling (grade 4).  Death (grade 5) as defined by NCI -CTCAE v.4.0 is mainly regarded as an outcome and will be docum ented accordingly (see below).  The causal relationship to Avelumab, TACE and radiotherapy as assessed by the Investigator (s); the decisive factor in the documentation is the temporal relation between the AE and the study drug. The following judgments of th e causality to study drug or study procedures are to be used:  Not Related = not suspected to be reasonably related to the investigational product. AE could not medically (pharmacologically/ clinically) be attributed to the investigational product under st udy in this protocol  Related = suspected to be reasonably related to the investigational product. AE could medically (pharmacologically/ clinically) be attributed to the investigational product under study in this protocol  Action taken on Avelumab (none, m edication discontinued, dose reduction, medication delayed, reduction of infusion rate).  Other action (none, concomitant medication given, new or prolonged hospitalization, procedural surgery).  The outcome according to the following definitions:  Recovered without sequelae (AE disappeared)  Recovered with sequelae (AE has resulted in permanent disability/incapacity)  Not yet recovered  Not recovered at death  Change in toxicity grade/severity or seriousness (e.g., an AE with no change of toxicity grade but new ly classified as an SAE due to hospitalization.  Fatal (AE resulted in death)  Concomitant medication given: Y es or No (Note: If this question is answered “Y es” the corresponding serious criteria must be ticked)  Subject died  Life-threatening"
43,page_43,"START -FIT v 4 (Date: 27 Apr, 2021) 44  New or prolonged hospitalization  Persistent/significant disability  Congenital abnormality  Important medical event  Seriousness: Yes or No If in any one patient the same AE occurs on several occasions, then the AE in question must be documented and assessed anew each time. 7.7.7 Procedure of Reporting Serious Adverse Events The Sponsor -Investigator(s) primary responsibilities for safety reporting are to identify and follow -up on Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) experienced by participants in the study and to forward the informa tion to the local regulatory authorities and Merck, as required by local regulations (for regulatory reporting) and as required by the ISS agreement (for reporting to Merck). The following reportable events must be submitted to Merck within 2 business day s or 3 calendar days (whichever comes first) using the applicable safety report form provided. The Principal Investigator (s) will assume responsibility for submitting the reportable event(s) to Merck as well as ensuring that any local reporting requirement s are completed in parallel.  Serious Adverse Events (see section 7.4.2)  Exposure during Pregnancy or Breastfeeding (even if not associated with an adverse event)  Occupational exposure (even if not associated with an adverse event)  Potential drug -induce d liver injury (Hy ’s Law cases): These events are considered important medical events and should be reported as SAEs.

It is the responsibility of the Investigator(s) that any necessary additional therapeutic measures and follow -up procedures are performed. 8. STATISTICS 8.1 Statistical Analysis  Patients who complete TACE will be consid ered as the study population for primary and secondary endpoints.  The primary endpoint - the rate of patients amendable to curative surgical intervention will be estimated based on exact binomial distribution.  Objective response rate (ORR) , pathological r esponse rate , and number of patients amendable to curative intervention s and / or radiological CR will be expressed based on exact binomial distribution.  Survival outcomes, including TTP, PFS and OS and their corresponding 95% confidence interval , will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier method .  Patient reported QoL scores will be estimated at baseline, during and following therapy. Scores at each time point will be summarized with descriptive statistics including means, standard deviations, median and range . The changes from baseline during therapy and after therapy will be calculated for each patient and also summarized with means and standard deviations. Linear mixed -effect model will be used to study the longitudinal changes of QoL scores.  All of the repo rted P values will be 1-tailed, and P<0.05 will be considered statistically significant. The analyses will be performed using statistical software package s SPSS and R. Procedures for Handling Missing, Unused, and Spurious Data : All available data will be included in the data listings and tabulations. Where appropriate, imputations of values for missing data for primary and secondary efficacy analyses will be performed as specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan. All data recorded on the CRF will be includ ed in the data listings that will accompany the clinical study report. If, after the study has begun, but prior to the conduct of any analysis, changes made to primary and / or key secondary endpoints, or the statistical methods related to those hypotheses , then the protocol will be amended. Changes to exploratory analyses made after the protocol"

Post hoc exploratory analyses will also be identified in the final report. 8.2 Sample Size Calculation H0: The null hypotheses of no difference in the number of patients who can undergo surgery: similar to the historical result of QMH , 5% of patients can undergo surgical intervention after TACE . H1: The alternative hypotheses of treatment efficacy: the experimental treatment would result in 20% of study population who can undergo surgical resection after treatment response . To detect 15% of differences from 5% to 20% in the number of patients proceeding to surgery, with Type I error of 0.05 and 80% power, assume 10% patients who have withdraw nmay withdraw consent and patient s who cannot be contacted during survival follow -up period, withdrawn subjects are only to before starting their protocol treatment . Patients will not be replaced once their protoc ol treatment start ed. The target accrual is 33 patients. Simon’s two - stage optimal design will be used . In the first stage ten patients will be enrolled. If at least one is amendable to curative surgical intervention , the study can proceed to the second st age and an additional 19 patients could be recruited. If at least 4 of the total 29 patients are amendable to curative surgical intervention , the treatment will be considered worthy of further investigation. 8.3 Early Stopping Rule Excessive toxicity will be monitored , which includes: (a) grade 4 or 5 hepatic; (b) grade 4 or 5 gastrointestinal; (c) grade 4 thrombocytopenia associated with any bleeding or grade 5 thrombocytopenia; (d) any grade 5 treatment -related adverse event. Assuming no more than a 10% rate of the above AEs on TACE, SBRT, or Avelumab alone , the increase to a rate of 30% or greater in the studied treatment will be considered unacceptable, and the study will be stopped prematurely . Upon the recruitment of these 33 patients, if 14 or more patients had treatment -related SAE, the study will be stopped. The corresponding lower bound of exact one - sided 90% confidence interval is 30.5%. The table below shows the stopping guideline scenarios for the first 8, 16 and 24 patients. For example, the study will be stopped when 11 of the first 24 patients develop an acute toxicity. The upper bound for the confidence intervals is 100%."

These documents state that the informed consent of the subjects is an essential precondition for particip ation in the clinical study. 9.2 Subject I nformation An unconditional prerequisite for a patient participating in the study is his/her written informed consent. Adequate information must therefore be given to the subject by the Investigator(s) before infor med consent is obtained. A person designated by the Investigator(s) may give the information, if permitted by local regulations. A subject information sheet in the local language and prepared in accordance with Good Clinical Practice will be provided by th e Investigator(s) for the purpose of obtaining informed consent. In addition to this written information, the Investigator(s) or his/her/their designate will inform the subject verbally. In doing so, the wording used will be chosen so that the information can be fully and readily understood by laypersons. The patient information sheet will be revised whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the consent of patients."
