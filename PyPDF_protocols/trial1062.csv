In this document, the term investigator refers to the individual responsible for the overall conduct of the clinical trial at a trial site. 3.1 Background information For an assessment of benefits and risks of the trial, see Section 18.1. 3.1.1 Type 2 diabetes mellitus Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a progressive metabolic disease primarily characterised by abnormal glucose metabolism. The pathogenesis is heterogeneous involving environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors leading to chronic hyperglycaemia caused by peripheral tissue insulin resistance, impaired insulin secretion due to abnormal beta-cell function and abnormal glucose metabolism in the liver3. Optimal glycaemic control is the treatment goal in subjects with T2DM in order to prevent long-term complications associated with chronic hyperglycaemia 4. Despite the availability of several anti-diabetic drugs, a significant proportion of subjects with T2DM do not achieve the recommended targets for glycaemic control 5,6. 3.1.2 Glucagon-like peptide-1 Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone with a glucose-dependent stimulatory effect on insulin and inhibitory effect on glucagon secretion from the pancreatic islets7,8. Subjects with T2DM have a decreased incretin effect9,10,11,12. However, the insulinotropic action of GLP-1 and thus, the ability to lower blood glucose (BG) levels, is preserved when GLP-1 is administered at supraphysiological levels13. In addition, supraphysiological levels of GLP-1 induce reduction in body weight14. GLP-1 is a physiological regulator of a ppetite and food intake and GLP-1 receptors are present in several areas of the brain involved in appetite regulation15,16. Physiologically, GLP-1 also has a pronounced inhibitory effect on gastric emptying; however this effect seems to diminish upon chronic exposure14,15,16. These mechanisms of action make GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) an attractive pharmacological treatment for T2DM17,18,19. 3.1.3 Oral semaglutide Semaglutide is a long-acting GLP-1 RA structurally similar to liraglutide (Victoza®), a once-daily GLP-1 RA developed by Novo Nordisk and approved worldwide for the treatment of T2DM. Compared to human native GLP-1, which has a short half-life, the semaglutide molecule has three CONFIDENTIAL"

The fatty di-acid side chain and the spacer mediate strong binding to albumin, thereby reducing renal clearance. The amino acid substitution at position 8 makes semaglutide less susceptible to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). The change in position 34 from a lysine to an arginine is included to have only one lysine in the sequence where to a spacer can be attached. Semaglutide is in development for oral once-daily treatment of T2DM. As the bioavailability of GLP-1 RAs is low when administered orally, semaglutide has been co-formulated with the absorption-enhancing excipient sodium N-[8-(2-hydroxybenzoyl) amino]caprylate (SNAC) to increase the bioavailability of semaglutide. The absorption-enhancing properties of SNAC co- formulation are based on the concept developed by SNAC facilitates the absorption of semaglutide in a strictly time and size dependent manner, primarily via the transcellular route. The available data for semaglutide co-formulated with SNAC support that the absorption takes place in the stomach in a localised, buffered environment in close proximity to the tablet erosion. The absorption process is hampered if dosed with food, liquid or in the presence of significant stomach content. The absorption enhancement requires co-formulation between semaglutide and SNAC. Throughout this document “oral semaglutide” will refer to the drug product, that is, semaglutide co-formulated with 300 mg SNAC. 3.1.4 Nonclinical data 3.1.4.1 Semaglutide The nonclinical programme for semaglutide was designed according to the ICH M3 guideline to support the clinical development22. The standard nonclinical data package required to support phase 3 clinical trials has been completed. In addition, 2-year carcinogenicity studies and a pre- and postnatal development toxicity study have been completed. Semaglutide was generally well tolerated in animals (mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys). Two potential safety issues have been identified and these are detailed below. Thyroid C-cell tumours in rodents Treatment-related non-genotoxic proliferative changes in the thyroid C-cells of mice and rats were observed in 2-year carcinogenicity studies with semaglutide; thyroid hyperplasia was preceded by an increase in serum calcitonin. C-cell changes have not been observed in long-term studies in non- human primate. The observed pattern of effects in mice and rats and lack of these effects in the non- human primate and in man suggest that the mechanism by which semaglutide acts on the thyroid C-CONFIDENTIAL"

According to this mechanism, C-cell hyperplasia is mediated by the GLP-1 receptor and is not associated with RET (re-arranged during transfection) gene activation and rodents appear to be particularly sensitive, whereas humans are not. The relevance for human subjects is currently unknown, but considered to be low23. Embryo−foetal development toxicity Semaglutide caused embryo-foetal development toxicity in the rat through a GLP-1 receptor mediated effect on the inverted yolk sac placenta leading to impaired nutrient supply to the developing embryo. Primates do not have an inverted yolk sac placenta which makes this mechanism unlikely to be of relevance to humans and cynomolgus monkeys. In the developmental toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkey, a marked maternal body weight loss associated with the pharmacological effect of semaglutide coincided with increased early foetal loss; however, there was no indication of a teratogenic potential of semaglutide in this species. A review of the results from the nonclinical studies can be found in the investigator’s brochure (IB) for semaglutide (subcutaneous administration), edition 1124and the IB for oral administration of semaglutide (NN9924), edition 725, or any updates of these documents. 3.1.4.2 SNAC SNAC was developed as an absorption-enhancing excipient for the oral route of administration. The nonclinical programme to support clinical phase 3 development and marketing authorisation application submission has been conducted including a 26-week carcinogenicity study in transgenic rasH2 mice and a 2-year carcinogenicity study in Sprague-Dawley rats. Measurements of lactate levels have been included at selected time points around peak concentrations of SNAC in two of the phase 3a trials in the PIONEER programme (PIONEER 1 and 2) with the intention to document that SNAC does not impair cellular respiration in humans. In addition, events of lactic acidosis must be reported as an AE requiring additional data collection, please refer to Section 8.4.1.2 , Section 12.1.5 and appendix B.CONFIDENTIAL"

The doses tested covered total exposures of SNAC in plasma (in terms of area under the curve [AUC]) of 2-fold in the mouse and up to 44-fold in the rat when compared to the mean total exposure of SNAC in humans following a clinical dose of 300 mg SNAC/day. A review of the SNAC results from the nonclinical studies can be found in the IB for oral administration of semaglutide (NN9924), edition 725, or any updates hereof. 3.1.5 Clinical data for oral semaglutide A comprehensive clinical pharmacology programme including 12 trials has been completed, as well as a 26-week phase 2 dose-finding trial involving more than 600 subjects with T2DM. For details on the individual trials, please see the IB for oral administration of semaglutide (NN9924) edition 725, or any updates hereof. 3.1.5.1 Pharmacokinetics In the multiple-dose trial (NN9924-3991), oral semaglutide has demonstrated a long mean terminal half-life (t½) ranging from 153 to 161 hours (~1 week) and a median time to reach maximum observed concentration (tmax) ranging from 1 to 2 hours in healthy subjects. In multiple-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) trials, the exposure to oral semaglutide increased with increasing dose. Overall, the pharmacokinetic properties of semaglutide appeared similar in healthy subjects and in subjects with T2DM. Exposure to semaglutide exhibits a substantially greater dose-to-dose variation following oral administration compared to subcutaneous (s.c.) administration. However, when administered orally once-daily the PK properties of semaglutide, i.e. low clearance and long half-life, will limit the variation in exposure at steady state. Data obtained following investigation of different dosing conditions for oral semaglutide have demonstrated that subjects should take the oral semaglutide tablet in the morning in a fasting state and at least 30 minutes before the first meal of the day.

All tablets of oral semaglutide contain 300 mg of SNAC regardless of the semaglutide dose. SNAC is rapidly absorbed with a median tmax ranging from 0.35 −0.5 hours in healthy subjects and from 0.52−1.43 hours in subjects with T2DM. It is extensively metabolised and no accumulation of SNAC has been observed in clinical trials. 3.1.5.2 Efficacy The efficacy of oral semaglutide in adult subjects with T2DM was investigated in a 26-week phase 2 dose-finding trial (NN9924-3790). In this trial, placebo or one of the following doses of oral semaglutide were administered once daily: 2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg. Results from the trial showed that oral semaglutide effectively lowered glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) and body weight. Placebo-adjusted reductions in HbA 1cwere dose-dependent and statistically significant for all oral semaglutide tr eatment arms at week 26 (range: -0.40% to -1.59%). Placebo-adjusted reductions in body weight were dose-dependent and statistically significant for oral semaglutide treatment doses of 10 mg and above at week 26 (range: -3.61 kg to -6.98 kg). 3.1.5.3 Safety In the clinical trials completed so far, no unexpected safety findings have been identified for oral semaglutide administered up to 40 mg once daily. Consistent with other GLP-1 RAs, commonly reported adverse events (AEs) included nausea and vomiting, most of which were mild to moderate in severity. In line with findings for other GLP-1 RAs, an increase in heart rate and serum levels of lipase and amylase has also been observed in subjects exposed to oral semaglutide. In addition to the 13 completed clinical trials with oral semaglutide, SNAC has been investigated in the programme of orally administrated heparin in combination with SNAC (heparin/SNAC). The heparin/SNAC programme ( ) included 29 phase 1 trials (SNAC doses ranged from 0.172-10.5 g). In three of these trials, SNAC alone was investigated (to a maximum CONFIDENTIAL"

The trials covered formulation development, food effect, hepatic and renal impairment, age-effect and drug-drug interaction. The programme also included a total of three phase 2 and 3 trials in which the effects of orally delivered heparin solution (with >1.5 g SNAC three times a day) was investigated. The overall safety profile of oral semaglutide and heparin/SNAC indicates that SNAC is safe and well-tolerated. For further details, please see the IB for oral administration of semaglutide (NN9924) edition 725, or any updates hereof. 3.1.6 Liraglutide The selected active comparator in this trial is liraglutide, an injectable GLP-1 RA approved for once-daily administration. Liraglutide was developed by Novo Nordisk and approved in 2009 in the EU, in 2010 in Japan, and in 2010 in the US under the trade name Victoza®to improve glycaemic control in adults with T2DM. For further details, please see the current approved label for liraglutide (Victoza®) in Japan26. 3.2 Rationale for the trial Many patients with T2DM are not in glycaemic control with the currently marketed oral anti- diabetic drugs (OADs). Nevertheless, treatment with more efficacious injectable therapies such as GLP-1 RAs and insulin are rarely added during the early stages of the disease. Oral semaglutide is the first GLP-1 RA in development in a tablet formulation and it has the potential of becoming a new attractive treatment option early in the treatment cascade due to its effects on both hyperglycaemia and body weight. 'The “Draft Guideline for Clin ical Evaluation of Hy poglycaemic Agents”27(hereafter, draft AD guideline) provided by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), Japan, specifies that in order to obtain the indication “T2DM” the investigational drug must be evaluated in a phase 2 study in Japanese patients with T2DM evaluating the efficacy, safety and dosage regimen as well as the dose-response relationship of the glucose-lowering effect. In addition, the “long-term” safety and efficacy of an investigational drug should be confirmed in monotherapy in a sufficient number of Japanese patients. The rationale for this trial is to assess the dose-response relationship of the glucose-lowering effect of oral semaglutide after 6 months and to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of oral semaglutide compared to placebo and liraglutide as monotherapy after 12 months of treatments.CONFIDENTIAL"

The treatment administration of liraglutide will be open-label. The total trial duration for the individual subject will be 59 to 65 weeks depending on pre-trial treatment. The trial includes a 2-week screening period, followed by a 52-week randomised treatment period and a follow-up period of 5 weeks. For subjects treated with OAD as monotherapy prior to the screening an 8-week wash-out period including the screening period will replace the 2- week screening period.

The number of subjects has been set based on the agreement with PMDA and is considered adequate to evaluate the dose-response relationship of once-daily dosing of three dose levels (3, 7 and 14 mg) of oral semaglutide versus placebo as monotherapy on glycaemic control. The parallel treatment groups, a randomised (double-blind/open-label) design have been chosen to assess the dose-response relationship, long-term safety and efficacy of oral semaglutide compared to placebo and active comparator liraglutide. Randomisation will be stratified based on pre-trial OAD treatment at screening (yes/no) to ensure even distribution of the 5 treatment arms within each stratum. There will be strict rescue criteria in place to ensure acceptable glycaemic control during the trial for all treatment arms, including the placebo arm. The treatment duration will be 52 weeks for the assessment of long-term safety of oral semaglutide as monotherapy in accordance with the draft AD guideline. The dose-response relationship will be evaluated based on data at week 26. No interim analysis will be done and the blinding will remain throughout the trial. The follow-up period is 5 weeks to allow for wash-out of semaglutide and to prevent interference in the antibody assay. CONFIDENTIAL"

Oral semaglutide treatment arms Oral semaglutide is a long-acting GLP-1 RA to be administered orally once-daily. All subjects randomised to oral semaglutide will initiate treatment with 3 mg once-daily. Subjects randomised to a treatment dose of 7 and 14 mg, will follow a fixed dose escalation regimen with 4 weeks between the dose escalation steps. The maintenance dose of 7 mg once-daily will be reached after 4 weeks on 3 mg once daily. The maintenance dose of 14 mg once-daily will be reached after 4 weeks on 3 mg, followed by 4 weeks on 7 mg once daily ( Table 5–1 ). All dose levels, including the dose- escalation, will be blinded. To mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs, it is important to follow the fixed 4-week dose escalation intervals. The dose must not be changed once the randomised dose of oral semaglutide has been reached. Placebo treatment Treatment with placebo tablets will follow the same rules for oral semaglutide treatment outlined above. Liraglutide treatment Treatment with liraglutide injections will be initiated at 0.3 mg once-daily. The dose will be escalated weekly, first to 0.6 mg once-daily and then to the recommended maximum dose of 0.9 mg once-daily according to the approved label in T2DM in Japan26. To mitigate the risk of gastrointestinal AEs, it is important to follow the weekly dose escalation intervals. The dose must not be changed during the course of the trial once the 0.9 mg maintenance dose of liraglutide has been reached.CONFIDENTIAL"

The tablet can be taken with up to half a glass of water (approximately 120 mL). The tablet must be swallowed whole by the subject and must not be broken or chewed (see Table 9– 2). Furthermore, other oral medication can be taken 30 minutes after administration of the oral trial product. Liraglutide dosing Liraglutide should be administered once-daily in the morning or evening at a fixed time and irrespective of meals. Liraglutide is injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, the thigh or the upper arm. The injection site should be changed at every injection and about 2~3 cm apart from the previous one.CONFIDENTIAL"

Please see section 6.4with regards to rescue medication. 5.4 Treatment after discontinuation of trial product When discontinuing trial products, either at the scheduled end of treatment visit (see Section 8.1.5 ) or if trial product is discontinued prematurely (see Section 8.1.6 ), the subject should be switched to a suitable marketed product at the discretion of the investigator. For subjects randomised to oral semaglutide/placebo treatment only, after discontinuation of trial products, GLP-1 RAs are not allowed before completion of the follow-up visit 5 weeks after the last date on trial products (to avoid interference with the antibody assay for semaglutide). Throughout the protocol, last date on trial product is defined as date of the subject’s last dosage of trial product. As this trial is a phase 2/3a trial, oral semaglutide will not be available for prescription until after marketing authorisation. 5.5 Rationale for treatment For oral semaglutide, the three dose levels (3, 7 and 14 mg), treatment initiation with the lowest dose and the 4-week dose escalation steps have been chosen based on data from the global phase 2 dose-finding trial. This regime is expected to have the optimal benefit-risk profile for further development for treatment of T2DM in the PIONEER programme. Liraglutide has been chosen as active comparator since it is a well-established injectable GLP-1 RA once-daily dosing. Treatment will be initiated at 0.3 mg once-daily in accordance with the current, approved label in Japan. Liraglutide will be dose escalated to the highest approved maintenance dose in Japan (0.9 mg) to compare all 3 dose levels of oral semaglutide with maximum dose of liraglutide as monotherapy in terms of efficacy and safety. The duration of randomised treatments is considered adequate to collect sufficient data on efficacy and safety in accordance with the trial objectives.CONFIDENTIAL"

To allow time for dose escalation to maximum dose and to observe the expected effect of treatment on glycaemic parameters, rescue criteria will be applied from week 8 and onwards. If any of the FPG values (including fasting SMPG) exceed the limits outlined below and no intercurrent cause of the hyperglycaemia can be identified, a confirmatory FPG (at central laboratory) should be obtained by calling the subject for a re-test. If the confirmatory FPG also exceeds the value described below, the subject should be offered rescue medication (initiation of new anti-diabetic medication): !13.3 mmol/L (240 mg/dL) from week 8 to end of week 13 !11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL) from week 14 to end of treatmentCONFIDENTIAL"

It is important for trial integrity that only subjects actually needing treatment intensification (as defined above) are started on rescue medication. Subjects that are started on rescue medication should continue to follow the protocol-specified visit schedule. Rescue medication should be prescribed at investigator’s discretion as add-on to randomised treatment and according to clinical practice in Japan or ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes guidelines28,29(excluding GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors and amylin analogues). If a subject experience persistent decline in renal function after starting rescue medication, the treatment with the rescue medication should be adjusted/discontinued according to the current approved label or guideline. Rescue medication and any changes hereto should be captured on the concomitant medication form in the electronic case report form (eCRF) (see section 8.2.4 ) Rescue medication is considered to be non-investigational medicinal product (NIMP) and will not be provided by Novo Nordisk A/S. 6.5 Criteria for premature discontinuation of trial product All efforts should be made to keep the subject on trial product. However, the subject may be prematurely discontinued from trial product at the discretion of the investigator due to a safety concern. For additional guidance, refer to appendix B. The subject must be prematurely discontinued from trial product if the following applies: 1. Safety concern related to trial product or unacceptable intolerability 2. Included in the trial in violation of the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria 3. Pregnancy 4. Intention of becoming pregnant 5. Simultaneous participation in another clinical trial of an approved or non-approved investigational medicinal product. 6. Calcitonin ≥ 100 ng/L If a criterion for premature discontinuation of trial product is met, trial product should not be re- initiated but subjects should continue with the scheduled site contacts. See Section 8.1.6 for procedures to be performed for subjects discontinuing trial product prematurely. 6.6 Withdrawal from trialCONFIDENTIAL"

The subject’s request to withdraw from the trial must always be respected. Only subjects who withdraw consent should be considered as withdrawn from trial. See Section 8.1.7 for procedures to be performed for subjects withdrawing consent. 6.7 Subject replacement Subjects who withdraw consent or discontinue trial product prematurely will not be replaced. 6.8 Rationale for trial population The trial population will include Japanese subjects with T2DM treated with diet and exercise therapy alone or a stable dose of one OAD as monotherapy in addition to diet and exercise for at least 30 days prior to screening. As the pre-trial OAD will be washed out before randomisation, only subjects treated with a OAD at half-maximum approved dose or below can be included in the trial. The HbA 1climits are between 6.5% and 9.5% for subjects treated with OAD as monotherapy and 7.0% and 10.0% for subjects treated with diet and exercise therapy alone. The limits of HbA 1c have been chosen, in order to include subjects needing intensification of anti-diabetic treatment. As it is expected that HbA 1cwill increase after discontinuation of the pre-trial OAD a lower HbA 1c level will be applied for subjects treated with OAD as monotherapy. The upper limit will secure that subjects with severely dysregulated T2DM are not enrolled in this placebo controlled trial. In addition, FPG and HbA 1cwill be monitored throughout the trial and rescue medication should be initiated in subjects with persistent, unacceptable hyperglycaemia. No BMI or blood pressure restrictions will be applied. Subjects with liver test abnormalities (ALT>2.5 x UNL) will be excluded to avoid potential confounding of liver safety assessments. In addition, subjects with severe and end-stage renal impairment will be excluded due to restrictions in the label of the comparator, liraglutide. Overall, the eligibility criteria allow for enrolment of a relatively broad trial population resembling the target population in common practice. Finally, the trial population was selected on the basis of the draft AD guideline27and the advice from PMDA.CONFIDENTIAL"

These are also included in the flow chart (see Section 2). Informed consent must be obtained before any trial related activity, see Section 18.2. Refer to flowchart (Section 2) for number and timing of visits and specific assessments to be performed. Each subject will attend 12 site visits and 1 or 2 phone contacts. It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that all site visits and phone contacts occur according to the flow chart. Planned visits can be conducted and re-scheduled within the allowed visit window. If a visit is missed and it is not possible to re-schedule, every effort should be made to ensure information is collected at a telephone contact (within the visit window) and entered into the eCRF. Subjects will be invited for the next scheduled visit according to the visit schedule. The investigator must keep a subject screening log, a subject identification code list and a subject enrolment log. Only subjects who have signed the informed consent form should be included on the logs. The subject screening log and subject enrolment log may be combined in one log. The investigator must keep a log of staff and a delegation of task(s) list at site. Investigator must sign the log of staff and the delegation of task(s) at site prior to the delegation of tasks. 8.1.1 Screening, visit 1 At screening, subjects will be provided with a card stating that they are participating in a trial and giving contact address(es) and telephone number(s) of relevant trial site staff. Subjects should be instructed to return the card to the investigator at the last trial visit or to destroy the card after the last visit. A screening session must be made in the IWRS. Each subject will be assigned a unique 6-digit subject number which will remain the same throughout the trial. Once all data relating to V1 have been obtained, these must be reviewed, dated and signed by the investigator and/or documented in medical records to assess that the subject is eligible to continue in the trial. If any untoward medical occurrence that might have worsened the renal or hepatic function from screening to randomisation, the investigator should reconsider the subject´s eligibility.CONFIDENTIAL"

During the wash-out period, the subjects should measure pre-breakfast SMPG (fasting for at least 6 hours) at least twice a week and if they experience hyperglycaemic symptoms. The subjects should record the SMPG values measured in the diary. If pre-breakfast SMPG (fasting state) is above 240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) or postprandial SMPG, if measured, is above 270 mg/dL (15.0 mmol/L), the subjects should contact the investigator for advice. The investigator should instruct the subject to measure his/her pre-breakfast SMPG on 3 consecutive days. If the subject has pre-breakfast SMPG (fasting state) above 240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) on 3 consecutive days, and/or if the investigator judges the subject's condition as unsafe regardless of the pre-breakfast SMPG, the subject will be excluded from the trial at the investigator's discretion, and regarded as screening failure. Phone contact 1 during wash-out period (P1W) will be performed at 4 weeks (±7 days) before Visit 2. The phone contact can be replaced with a “visit” if for instance further examination is needed at the investigator's discretion. Screening failures: For screening failures the screening failure form in the eCRF must be completed with the reason for not continuing in the trial. Serious adverse events (SAEs) from screening failures must be transcribed by the investigator into the eCRF. Follow-up on SAEs must be carried out according to Section 12. A screening failure session must be made in the IWRS. The case book must be signed. Re-screening is NOT allowed if the subject has failed one of the inclusion or exclusion criteria, this includes re-sampling if the subject has failed one of the inclusion or exclusion criteria related to laboratory parameters. However, in case laboratory samples are lost (e.g. haemolysed/displaced), re-sampling is allowed. 8.1.2 Fasting visits The subjects must attend several visits in a fasting state (see Section 2). Fasting for blood sampling is defined as no food or liquid within the last 8 hours prior to blood sampling, however water is allowed up until 2 hours prior to blood sampling.CONFIDENTIAL"

Other oral medication can be taken 30 minutes after trial product. Injectable medications can be administered after blood sampling. For the subjects allocated to liraglutide, the trial product and/or other oral and injectable medications must be taken after the blood sampling has been performed. In case a subject attends a fasting visit in a non-fasting state, all non-fasting measurements should be performed. The subject should return to the site in a fasting state to have the fasting blood samples done within the visit window for the relevant visit. For fasting samples, see Section 8.3.1 . 8.1.3 Randomisation and trial product administration (visit 2) Eligible subjects will be randomised into one of 5 treatment arms. The randomisation session must be performed in the IWRS which will allocate the dispensing unit number (DUN) of trial product to be dispensed to the subject. All visit 2 assessments must be performed before administration of first dose of trial product. Blood samples should be taken after randomisation session since semaglutide antibodies are not applicable for subjects randomised to liraglutide. Trial products (see Section 9) will be dispensed to the subject by the site, hospital pharmacy or equivalent at each site visit during the trial from randomisation to last visit before the End-of- treatment visit (see Section 2). The investigator must document that subjects are trained in the dosing instructions at every dispensing visit, please see Section 5.3.1 . For the subjects randomised to liraglutide, the investigator must instruct the subject to escalate the dose of liraglutide from 0.3 mg once-daily to 0.6 mg once-daily after the first week of treatment and to 0.9 mg once daily after the second week of treatment. Date of first administration of trial product will be captured in the eCRF. 8.1.4 Phone contacts after randomisation (P3) The planned phone contact (P3) should be conducted 2 weeks ( ±3 days) after randomisation (see Section 2). For the subjects randomised to liraglutide, at P3, the investigator should follow-up to ensure the dose escalation that should be done by subject.CONFIDENTIAL"

A completion call must be performed in the IWRS after completion of visit 12 (see Section 10). In case the subject cannot be reached (by clinic visit or phone contact) at the scheduled visit 13, the site should consult the contacts provided by the subject (e.g. close relatives), relevant physicians and medical records to collect health status. If no health status can be collected, the subject should be considered lost to follow-up and this should be specified in the end-of-trial form. 8.1.6 Premature discontinuation of trial product and follow-up (visits 12A and 13A) Subjects, who discontinue trial product prematurely, should attend visit 12A scheduled to take place on the day of discontinuation of trial product (+ 3 days visit window). Visit 13A should be scheduled 5 weeks (+3 days visit window) after the last date on trial product. The primary reason for premature discontinuation of trial product must be specified in the end-of-trial form in the eCRF, and final drug accountability must be performed. A treatment discontinuation session must be made in the IWRS at visit 12A (see Section 10). If premature discontinuation of trial product is decided during a scheduled visit, the visit will be converted into a visit 12A and trial procedures must be performed accordingly. Subjects should continue with the originally scheduled site contacts after visit 13A and up to and including visit 12. If necessary, in order to retain the subject in the trial, site visits can be replaced by phone contacts after visit 13A. However, as a minimum, these subjects should be asked to attend the scheduled visit 8 at week 26 and end-of-treatment (visit 12) at week 52 as these visits should be performed for all subjects, if at all possible (except subjects who withdraw informed consent, see Section 8.1.7 ). Subjects, who only agree to attend or provide health status at the planned visit 12, should not be considered withdrawn from the trial. In case the subject cannot be reached (by clinic visit or phone contact) at the scheduled visit 12, the site should consult the contacts provided by the subject (e.g. close relatives), relevant physicians and medical records to collect health status. If no health status can be collected, the subject should be considered lost to follow-up and this should be specified in the end-of-trial form. In summary, subjects should stay in the trial irrespective of lack of adherence to randomised treatment, lack of adherence to visit schedule, missing assessments or trial product discontinuation for any reason. Only subjects who decline any further contact with the site in relation to the trial should be considered as withdrawn from the trial (for withdrawal procedures, see Section 8.1.7 ). CONFIDENTIAL"

If clarification of entries or discrepancies in the diary or PROs is needed, the subject must be questioned and a conclusion made in the subject’s medical record. Care must be taken not to bias the subject. The documents must be retained at the site as source documentation. For ECGs, physical examinations and eye examinations, the evaluations must follow the categories: !Normal !Abnormal – Was the result clinically significant? (yes/no) The evaluation should be based on investigator’s judgement. For laboratory report values outside the reference range, the investigator must specify whether the value is clinically significant or not clinically significant. All laboratory printouts must be signed and dated by the investigator prior to the following visit. The signed laboratory report is retained at the site as source documentation. In case of abnormal clinically significant findings found as a result of screening procedures conducted at V1 or assessments revealing baseline conditions at V2, the investigator must state a comment in the subject’s medical record and record this in the medical history/concomitant illness form in the eCRF.

The subject must attend these visits fasting (see Section 8.1.2 ). A central FPG result ≤ 3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) in relation to planned fasting visits should not be reported as a hypogly caemic episode but as a clinical laboratory adverse event (CLAE) at the discretion of the investigator (see Section 12.1.1 ). 8.3.2 Self-measured plasma glucose (SMPG) At visit 1, subjects will be provided with a blood glucose meter (BG meter) including auxiliaries as well as instructions for use. The subjects will be instructed in how to use the device and the instruction will be repeated as necessary during the trial. The provided BG meter should be used for SMPG measurement. The BG meters use test strips calibrated to plasma values. Therefore, all measurements performed with capillary blood are automatically calibrated to plasma equivalent glucose values, which will be shown on the display. Only the BG meter provided by Novo Nordisk or the same model purchased by the trial site should be used for the measurements required in the protocol. Subjects should be instructed in how to record the results of the SMPG values in the diaries. The record of each SMPG value should include date, time and value. All data from the diary must be transcribed into the eCRF during or following the contact. If obtained via phone and a discrepancy is later detected, between the diary and the SMPG data obtained at the phone contact, the values in the eCRF must be corrected. Occasional review by the investigator of the values stored in the memory of the BG meter and correct reporting of these in the diary is advised in order to ensure adequacy of the data reported in the trial database. 7-point self-measured plasma glucose profile The subject will be instructed to perform a 7-point SMPG profile 3 times during the trial period (see Section 2) using the BG meter provided for the trial. The 7-point SMPG profile should be performed on a day where the subject does not anticipate unusual strenuous exercise. The 7-point SMPG profile should preferably be taken within a week prior to the visit.

The body weight should be assessed on the same calibrated weighing scale equipment throughout the trial, if possible. Height is measured without shoes in centimetres and recorded in the eCRF to nearest ½ cm. 8.3.4 Waist circumference The waist circumference is defined as the minimal abdominal circumference located midway between the lower rib margin and the iliac crest. The measurement of waist circumference must be performed and recorded in the eCRF. Waist circumference is measured in the horizontal plane and rounded up or down to the nearest ½ cm using a non-stretchable measuring tape. The same measuring tape should be used throughout the trial. The circumference should be measured when the subject is in a standing position, with an empty bladder and wearing light clothing. The subject should be standing, feet together with arms down their side and waist accessible. The tape should touch the skin but not compress soft tissue and twists in the tape should be avoided. The subject should be asked to breathe normally and the measurement should be taken when the subject is breathing out gently. 8.3.5 Patient reported outcomes questionnaires PRO will be assessed using the questionnaires: !SF-36v2™ (acute version) health survey35,36,37 !Diabetes Therapy-Related QOL (DTR-QOL) questionnaire38 The questionnaires must be completed by the subject as specified in the flow chart, see Section 2, preferably before any other trial-related activities for that visit. It takes approximately 15 minutes to complete the two questionnaires. Subjects should be given the opportunity to complete the questionnaires by themselves without interruption.

For some of the analyses related to suspicion of acute pancreatitis and hypersensitivity, a local laboratory must be used (see appendix B). The handling, transportation and storage of biological samples are described in the laboratory manual (for central and special laboratory details see Attachment I). Samples will be coded in order to keep subject identity anonymous. Laboratory samples not drawn on the day of the actual visit should preferably be drawn on another day within the visit window stated in the flow chart (see Section 2). Please note that a laboratory sample pertaining to a specific visit must always be reported to that visit. For some of the samples drawn during the trial, subjects will be asked to attend the site visits fasting (fasting for blood sampling is defined in Section 8.1.2 ). The central laboratory will provide laboratory results to the investigator on an ongoing basis.

Blood samples will be drawn for assessment of plasma concentration of semaglutide at selected visits (see Section 2). The semaglutide concentrations will be used for population PK analysis. Samples for PK analysis will be drawn at any time during the visit except for V8. At V8, samples should be taken pre-dose and 60 −90 minutes post dosing. The date and time of the latest trial product administration prior to the sampling for PK analysis must be recorded and transcribed into the eCRF. The exact date and time for sampling the blood for PK analysis must be recorded on the lab requisition form. Blood samples for PK analysis must be collected, handled and shipped according to the description in the laboratory manual supplied by the central laboratory (see attachment I).

Prior to visits where drug accountability is performed, the subject will be asked to return all used, partly used and unused trial products. The investigator must assess the amount of trial products returned compared to what was dispensed at the last dispensing visit and, in case of discrepancies, question the subject. If a subject is found to be non-compliant, the investigator will remind the subject of the importance of following the instructions given including taking the trial products as prescribed and should document this discussion in the subject’s medical record.CONFIDENTIAL"

A randomisation session will be carried out for all subjects using the IWRS. At the randomisation visit (visit 2), subjects meeting all eligibility criteria will be randomised to one of five parallel treatment arms as described in Section 5.1. Randomisation will be stratified based on pre-trial treatment (with or without OAD) at screening to ensure an even distribution of the 5 treatment arms within strata. 11.1 Breaking of blinded codes Since the trial is double-blinded with regard to semaglutide and placebo, the blinded codes may possibly be broken for the subjects allocated to semaglutide/placebo treatment arms. The IWRS will notify Novo Nordisk (monitor and the Global Safety department) immediately after the code is broken. The code for a particular subject allocated to oral semaglutide/placebo may be broken in a medical emergency if knowing the actual treatment would influence the treatment of the subject. Whenever a code is broken the person breaking the code must print the Code Break Confirmation Notification generated by the IWRS, record the reason, and sign and date the document. When the code is broken, the treatment allocation will be accessible to the investigator and the Novo Nordisk Global Safety department. If IWRS is not accessible at the time of code break the IWRS helpdesk should be contacted. Contact details are listed in Attachment I. If the code has been broken, the subject must discontinue treatment with trial product but be asked to continue in the trial (see Section 8.1.6 ). A treatment discontinuation session must be completed in IWRS.CONFIDENTIAL"

An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a product, whether or not considered related to the product. An AE includes: !A clinically significant worsening of a concomitant illness. !A clinical laboratory adverse event (CLAE): a clinical laboratory abnormality which is clinically significant, i.e. an abnormality that suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity that requires active management. Active management includes active treatment or further investigations, for example change of medicine dose or more frequent follow-up due to the abnormality. The following should not be reported as AEs: !Pre-existing conditions, including those found as a result of screening or other trial procedures performed before exposure to trial product (pre-existing conditions should be reported as medical history or concomitant illness). !Pre-planned procedures unless the condition for which the procedure was planned has worsened from the first trial related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent. !Non-serious hypoglycaemia is an AE, but is reported on a hypoglycaemic episode form instead of on an AE form, see Section 8.4.9 . The following three definitions are used when assessing an AE: !Severity –Mild – no or transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities. –Moderate – marked symptoms, moderate interference with the subject’s daily activities. –Severe – considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities; unacceptable. !Causality Relationship between an AE and the relevant trial product(s): –Probable – Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship. –Possible – A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed. –Unlikely – The event is most likely related to aetiology other than the trial product.CONFIDENTIAL"

This term is only applicable if the subject has completed the trial or has died from another AE. –Recovered/resolved with sequelae – The subject has recovered from the condition, but with lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequela meets an SAE criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE. –Not recovered/not resolved – The condition of the subject has not improved and the symptoms are unchanged, or the outcome is not known. –Fatal – This term is only applicable if the subject died from a condition related to the reported AE. Outcomes of other reported AEs in a subject before he/she died should be assessed as “recovered/resolved”, “recovering/resolving”, “recovered/resolved with sequelae” or “not recovered/not resolved”. An AE with fatal outcome must be reported as an SAE. –Unknown – This term is only applicable if the subject is lost to follow-up. 12.1.2 Serious adverse event A serious adverse event (SAE) is an experience that at any dose results in any of the following: !Death. !A life-threateningaexperience. !In-patient hospitalisationbor prolongation of existing hospitalisation. !A persistent or significant disability or incapacityc. !A congenital anomaly or birth defect. !Important medical events that may not result in death, be life threateningaor require hospitalisationbmay be considered an SAE when - based on appropriate medical judgement - they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition of SAEd. a.The term “life threatening” in the definition of SAE refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe. b.The term “hospitalisation” is used when a subject: – Is admitted to a hospital or in-patient, irrespective of the duration of physical stay, or – Stays at the hospital for treatment or observation for more than 24 hoursCONFIDENTIAL"

Hospitalisations for administrative, trial related and social purposes do not constitute AEs and should therefore not be reported as AEs or SAEs. Hospital admissions for surgical procedures, planned before trial inclusion, are not considered AEs or SAEs. c.A substantial disruption of a subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions (e.g. following the event or clinical investigation the subject has significant, persistent or permanent change, impairment, damage or disruption in his/her body function or structure, physical activity and/or quality of life). d.For example intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home of allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. The following AEs must always be reported as an SAE using the important medical event criterion if no other seriousness criteria are applicable: !suspicion of transmission of infectious agents via the trial product !risk of liver injury defined as ALT or AST >3 x UNL and total bilirubin >2 x UNL, where no alternative aetiology exists (Hy's law). Additional assessments should be made for events meeting the criterion of Hy’s law as stated above (see appendix B). 12.1.3 Non-serious adverse event A non-serious AE is any AE which does not fulfil the definition of an SAE. 12.1.4 Medication errors A medication error concerning trial products is defined as: !Administration of wrong drug or use of wrong device. Note: Use of wrong DUN is not considered a medication error unless it results in administration of wrong drug. !Wrong route of administration, such as intramuscular instead of s.c.. !Administration of an overdose with the intention to cause harm (e.g. suicide attempt), misuse or abuse of trial product. !Accidental administration of a higher dose than intended. A higher dose is a dose of at least one tablet more than the intended dose and for pen injection a higher dose than 0.9 mg/day; however, the administered dose must deviate from the intended dose to an extent where clinical consequences for the trial subject were likely to happen as judged by the investigator, although they did not necessarily occur.CONFIDENTIAL"

This includes events occurring from the first trial-related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent until the end of the post-treatment follow-up period (V13) for subjects on trial product OR until the end of trial (V12 or V13A, whichever comes last) for the subjects who have discontinued trial product prematurely. Events for withdrawn subjects will be collected and reported until last trial related contact with the subject. The events must be recorded in the applicable eCRF forms in a timely manner, see timelines below and Figure 12–1 . During each contact with the trial site staff, the subject must be asked about AEs and technical complaints, for example by asking: “Have you experienced any problems since the last contact?” All AEs, either observed by the investigator or subject, must be reported by the investigator and evaluated. All AEs must be recorded by the investigator in the eCRF AE form. The investigator should report the diagnosis, if available. If no diagnosis is available, the investigator should record each sign and symptom as individual AEs using separate AE forms in the eCRF. For SAEs, a SIF must be completed in addition to the AE form. A SIF is a form to collect supplementary clinical information. If several symptoms or diagnoses occur as part of the same clinical picture, one SIF can be used to describe all the SAEs. AEs requiring additional data collection must be reported using both the AE form and the specific event form. A specific event form is a form tailored to collect specific information related to the individual event. See appendix B for details about the events and the additional information to report. In case any of these events fulfil the criteria for seriousness in Section 12.1.2 , then the event should be reported as serious. Some events will undergo event adjudication by the EAC, please refer to Section 12.7.2 . For AEs qualifying for event adjudication, the adjudication form will also have to be completed in the eCRF. The adjudication form is a checklist of clinical data to be provided from the site.

In addition, the investigator will be informed of any trial-related SAEs that may warrant a change in any trial procedure. In accordance with regulatory requirements, Novo Nordisk will inform the regulatory authorities, including European Medicines Agency (EMA), of trial product-related SUSARs. In addition, Novo Nordisk will inform the institutional review boards (IRBs) of trial product-related SUSARs in accordance with local requirement and ICH GCP 1, unless locally this is an obligation of the investigator. Novo Nordisk products used as concomitant medication or non-investigational medicinal product: If an AE is considered to have a causal relationship with a Novo Nordisk marketed product used as NIMP product or concomitant medication in the trial, it is important that the suspected relationship is reported to Novo Nordisk, e.g. in the alternative aetiology section on the SIF. Novo Nordisk may need to report this AE to relevant regulatory authorities. 12.3 Follow-up of adverse events The investigator must record follow-up information by updating the medical records and the forms in the eCRF.

Treatment of an overdose should be symptomatic. There is a potential risk of hypoglycaemia during dosing with semaglutide. The typical signs and symptoms of a non-severe hypoglycaemia include: hunger, slight headache, nausea, light- headedness, palpitations and sweating. Symptoms of non-severe hypoglyc aemia should be treated by ingestion of carbohydrates. Severe hypoglycaemia resulting in loss of consciousness should be treated according to best available medical practise. One case of accidental overdose of oral semaglutide was reported in the NN9924-3692 trial. The subject accidentally took the trial product day and was thus treated with 20 mg of oral semaglutide. The subject did not report any symptoms and treatment was continued without any change. One case of accidental overdose has been reported in subjects treated with s.c. semaglutide once weekly. The subject inadvertently injected mg of semaglutide instead of 0.4 mg, which corresponds to a -fold higher dose than the maximum dose included in that trial. After hours the subject felt nauseated, vomited and had a headache. The subject was instructed to drink sufficient amounts of fluids. and the subject wished to continue in the trial. No symptoms of hypoglycaemia or any other symptoms or signs were noted. For further details please see the current edition of the IB for oral administration of semaglutide (NN9924), edition 7, and any updates hereof. For liraglutide and placebo, see Sections 18.1.2 and 18.1.3 , respectively.CONFIDENTIAL"

The oral semaglutide safety committee may recommend unblinding of any data for further analysis, and in this case an independent ad hoc group will be established in order to maintain the blinding of the trial personnel. 12.7.2 Event adjudication committee An independent external EAC is established to perform validation of selected AEs according to pre- defined diagnostic criteria. The validation is based on review of pre-defined clinical data related to the specific AE. Pre-defined clinical data consist of copies of source documents collected and delivered by the investigational sites. The EAC is composed of permanent members covering required medical specialities. EAC members must disclose any potential conflicts of interest and must be independent of Novo Nordisk. The events are reviewed by the EAC in a blinded manner. The EAC will have no authorisations to impact on trial conduct, trial protocol or amendments. The EAC works in accordance with written guidelines included in the EAC Charter describing in details the composition, tasks, responsibilities and work processes of the committee. The events outlined in Table 12–2 have been selected for adjudication in order to obtain an external independent validation of the diagnosis. In addition, cardiovascular events are being adjudicated according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirements45. The EAC will review copies in English (translated if necessary) of medical documentation received in the adjudication packages (e.g. x-rays, ECGs, ultrasound images, discharge summaries, pathology reports and death certificates). The investigator must provide medical documentation as soon as possible, when they receive the request from Novo Nordisk or the event adjudication vendor. The AEs for adjudication are listed in Table 12–2 .CONFIDENTIAL"

The first monitoring visit will be performed as soon as possible after FSFV at the trial site and no later than 4 weeks after. The monitoring visit intervals will depend on the outcome of the remote monitoring of the eCRFs, the trial site's recruitment rate and the compliance of the trial site to the protocol and GCP, but will not exceed 12 weeks until LSLV at the trial site (for trial sites with active subjects [defined as subjects in screening, treatment or follow-up]). The monitor must be given direct access to all source documents (original documents, data and records). Direct access includes permission to examine, analyse, verify and reproduce any record(s) and report(s) that are important to the evaluation of the trial. If the electronic medical record does not have a visible audit trail, the investigator must provide the monitor with signed and dated printouts. In addition the relevant trial site staff should be available for discussions at monitoring visits and between monitoring visits (e.g. by telephone). All data must be verifiable in source documentation other than the eCRF. For all data recorded the source document must be defined in a source document agreement at each trial site. There must only be one source defined at any time for any data element. Source data generated by the trial site can be corrected by another person than the person entering the source data; any correction must be explained, signed and dated by the person making the correction. The original of the completed diaries and/or PROs must not be removed from the trial site, unless they form part of the CRF/eCRF and a copy is kept at the site. The monitor will ensure that the eCRFs are completed and that paper CRFs are collected. The following data will be source data verified for screening failures: !Date for obtaining informed consent !Reason for screening failure Monitors will review the subject’s medical records and other source data (e.g. the diaries and PROs) to ensure consistency and/or identify omissions compared to the eCRF. If discrepancies are found, the investigator must be questioned about these. A follow-up letter (paper or electronic) will be sent to the investigator following each monitoring visit.

The SAP will be finalised before database lock. The blinding of the randomised treatments will be maintained until the database has been released for statistical analysis. No interim analyses will be performed before the database is locked. Data from all sites will be analysed and reported together. In statistical analyses where stratification is included, the pre-trial OAD treatment at screening (yes/no) will be included based on the actual information collected through the eCRF. In case of missing eCRF information the information collected from the IWRS system will be used. In the statistical analyses the stratification factor will refer to pre-trial OAD treatment at screening. The latest available measurement, at or prior to the randomisation visit, will be used as the baseline measurement. If no measurement(s) have been obtained, at or prior to randomisation, the baseline value will be left missing. Laboratory values below the lower limit of quantification (LLoQ) will be set to ½LLoQ. Number of values below LLoQ by treatment and visit will be summarised if deemed relevant. The primary efficacy endpoints will be evaluated at week 26. This approach will result in a lower proportion of missing data, use of rescue medication and premature treatment discontinuation, compared to the expected proportion of missing data at week 52 and therefore considered a meaningful representation and confirmation of the dose-response relationship of oral semaglutide. Results from a statistical analysis will as a minimum be presented by the estimated treatment contrasts for the below six comparisons with associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals and p- values corresponding to two-sided tests of no difference: !oral semaglutide 14 mg vs. placebo !oral semaglutide 14 mg vs. liraglutide 0.9 mg !oral semaglutide 7 mg vs. placebo !oral semaglutide 7 mg vs. liraglutide 0.9 mg !oral semaglutide 3 mg vs. placebo !oral semaglutide 3 mg vs. liraglutide 0.9 mg If no statistical analysis is specified, data will be presented using relevant summary statistics.CONFIDENTIAL"

Generalisation of this estimand depends among other things on the extent to which the adherence to trial product administration in this trial reflects the behaviour of the target population. Accordingly, only data collected prior to discontinuation of trial product or initiation of rescue medication will be used to draw inference. This will avoid confounding from rescue medication. !Secondary estimand – de-facto treatment difference (oral semaglutide versus placebo and oral semaglutide versus liraglutide) at week 26 in all randomised subjects regardless of discontinuation of trial product or initiation of rescue medication(s) The secondary de-facto estimand assesses the expected glycaemic benefit in a future population that results from subjects initiating treatment with oral semaglutide including potential rescue medication(s). Generalisation of this estimand depends among other things on the extent to which the use of rescue medication in this trial reflects clinical practice and the adherence to trial product administration in this trial reflects the behaviour of the target population. Accordingly, data collected regardless of discontinuation of trial product or initiation of rescue medication(s) will be used to draw inference. Missing data considerations Based on the results from similar Japanese phase 3 trials investigating liraglutide and s.c. semaglutide as monotherapy (NN2211-1700, NN9535-4091 and NN9535-4092) and the oral semaglutide phase 2 trial (NN9924-3790), it is expected that maximum 30% of the subjects will discontinue trial product or withdrawal from the trial at week 52. When estimating the secondary estimand, the proportion of subject with missing data, i.e., data that do not exist even though subjects are intended to stay in the trial regardless of treatment status and initiation of rescue medication is expected to be maximum 10% based on the oral semaglutide phase 2 trial (NN9924-3790). Thus, missing data will mainly be due to withdrawal from trial or lost to follow-up.CONFIDENTIAL"

The proportion of subject with missing data at week 26 is expected to be maximum 20% based on the liraglutide phase 3 trial (NN2211-1700), s.c. semaglutide phase 3 trials (NN9535-4091 and NN9535-4092) and the oral semaglutide phase 2 trial (NN9924-3790). Across treatment arms the main reasons for missing data are expected to be early treatment discontinuation due to AEs (gastrointestinal AEs for oral semaglutide and liraglutide) and initiation of rescue medication. Initiation of rescue medication is expected to be more frequent in the placebo arm than for the oral semaglutide and liraglutide arms. A higher proportion of subjects are expected to discontinue treatment due to AEs in the oral semaglutide and liraglutide arms, compared to the placebo arm. So overall the frequency of missing data is expected to be similar across treatment arms. Descriptive summaries and graphical representation of extent, reason(s) for and pattern of missing data will be presented by treatment arm. 17.1 Sample size calculation The total sample size of 240 subjects and duration of this trial have been determined to allow for adequate (i) evaluation of the dose-response relationship and (ii) safety evaluation in a monotherapy setting in line with the Japanese draft AD guideline27. With a maximum expected premature treatment discontinuation rate of 30% after week 52, this trial ensures that at least 100 subjects are exposed to oral semaglutide for one year. Based on 48 subjects per treatment arm and a standard deviation of 1.1% in change from baseline to week 26 in HbA 1c, the width of the 95% confidence interval (precision) for the mean difference in HbA 1cwill at most be +/- 0.5 %-point with 90% probability. Furthermore, with 48 subjects per treatment arm the trial will be able to show a significant HbA 1c treatment difference of 0.74 %-point with 90% power and a treatment difference of 0.64 %-point with 80% power. As a reference, the assumed treatment effects (TE) and adjusted treatment effects are presented in Table 17–1 . These are based on the oral semaglutide phase 2 results (NN9924- 3790) and supported by results from the s.c. semaglutide phase 2 trial (NN9535-1821). The adjustment of the treatment effects are done differently when estimating the primary and the secondary estimand, due to the different analyses and the inclusion of data collected after treatment discontinuation and initiation of rescue medication for the secondary estimand. The treatment effects will be adjusted according to a 50% smaller effect in subjects with missing data when estimating the primary estimand. Whereas a 75% smaller effect will be used for the 10% of the CONFIDENTIAL"

The in-trial observation period starts at randomisation (as registered in IWRS) and ends at the date of: !The last direct subject-site contact, which is scheduled to take place 5 weeks after planned last dose of trial product at a follow-up visit !Withdrawal for subjects who withdraw their informed consent !The last subject-investigator contact as defined by the investigator for subjects who are lost to follow-up !Death for subjects who dies before any of the above On-treatment: This observation period represents the time period where subjects are considered treated with trial product. The observation period is a subset of the in-trial observation period. It starts at the date of first dose of trial product. Two slightly different end dates will be needed to cover all assessments appropriately. For adjudicated events, ECGs, anti-semaglutide antibodies and AEs including hypoglycaemic ep isodes, the observation period ends at the first date of any of the following: !The follow-up visit (V13) !The follow-up prematurely discontinuation visit (V13A) !The last date on trial product + 38 days !The end-date for the in-trial observation period The follow-up visit is scheduled to take place 5 weeks after the last date on trial product corresponding to approximately five half-lives of oral semaglutide. The visit window for the follow- up visit is +3 days. For efficacy and other safety assessments (laboratory assessments, physical examination and vital signs) the observation period ends at the last date on trial product +3 days. This will be used in order to ensure specificity to reversible effects of treatment. On-treatment without rescue medication: This observation period is a subset of the on-treatment observation period, where subjects are considered treated with trial product, but have not initiated any rescue medications. Specifically it starts at date of first dose of trial product and the observation period ends at the first date of: !The last dose of trial product +3 days !Initiation of rescue medication The in-trial observation period will be the primary observation period when estimating the secondary estimand.

Baseline data will always be included in an observation period. For adjudicated events, the onset date will be the EAC adjudicated onset date. Before data are locked for statistical analysis and the randomisation code is broken, a review of all data will take place. Any decision to exclude either a subject or single observations from the statistical analysis is the joint responsibility of the members of the Novo Nordisk study group. Exclusion of data from analyses should be used restrictively, and normally no data should be excluded from the FAS. The subjects or observations to be excluded, and the reasons for their exclusion must be documented and signed by those responsible before database lock. The subjects and observations excluded from analysis sets, and the reason for this, will be described in the clinical trial report. 17.3 Primary endpoint The primary endpoint is change from baseline to week 26 in HbA 1c. 17.3.1 Analysis for the primary estimand The primary estimand will be estimated based on the FAS using post-baseline measurements up to and including week 26 from the on-treatment without rescue medication observation period. The dose-response will be evaluated by a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM). A restricted maximum likelihood will be used. The model will include all post-baseline HbA 1c measurements collected at scheduled visits up to and including week 26 as dependent variables. The independent effects included in the model will be treatment and stratification factor as categorical fixed effects and baseline HbA 1cas a covariate, all nested within visit. An unstructured covariance matrix for HbA 1cmeasurements within the same subject will be employed, assuming measurements from different subjects are independent. From this analysis estimated differences with corresponding two sided p-values and 95% confidence intervals after 26 weeks of treatment will be presented for all pairwise comparison of oral semaglutide versus placebo. In addition to the dose- response evaluation, oral semaglutide will be compared to liraglutide 0.9 mg and estimated differences with corresponding two sided p-values and 95% confidence intervals after 26 weeks of treatment will be presented for all pairwise comparison of oral semaglutide versus liraglutide 0.9 mg.

The dose-response relationship of oral semaglutide will be supported by an exploratory analysis. In this model data from all oral semaglutide treatment arms will be included and data from the placebo arm (corresponding to a dose of zero mg) could be included if appropriate. The model will be developed ad hoc after unblinding of the trial to aim for a suitable fit of the dose-response relationship using e.g. a linear or a four-parameter logistic relation of HbA 1cvs. the logarithm of the dose. 17.3.2 Analysis for the secondary estimand The secondary estimand will be estimated based on the FAS using week 26 measurements from the in-trial observation period. The statistical analysis for the secondary estimand will be a pattern mixture model using multiple imputation to handle missing data assuming that the missing data mechanism is missing at random (MAR) within the groups used for imputation. Imputation of missing data at week 26 will be done within 10 groups of subjects defined by randomised treatment arm, and whether subjects at week 26; (i) have discontinued treatment or initiated rescue medication or (ii) are still on treatment and have not initiated rescue medication. It is hereby assumed that the likely values of what the missing data would have been if available are best described by information from subjects who at week 26 are similar in terms of randomised treatment arm and treatment adherence/rescue medication status. Missing values for each group will be imputed as follows: !An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with stratification factor as a categorical fixed effect and baseline HbA 1cmeasurement as a covariate will be fitted to observed values of the change from baseline in HbA 1cat week 26. !The estimated parameters for location and dispersion will be used to impute 100 values for each subject with missing week 26 data based on stratification factor and baseline HbA 1c. Thus, 100 complete data sets will be generated including observed and imputed values. Analysis used for testing superiority versus placebo at week 26: For each of the 100 (now complete) imputed data sets the change from baseline to week 26 in HbA 1cwill be analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and stratification factor as categorical fixed effects and baseline HbA 1cas covariate. The results obtained from analysing the datasets will be combined using Rubin’s rule47to draw inference. From this analysis the estimated treatment differences between each of the oral semaglutide dose levels and placebo together with associated two-sided 95% CIs and unadjusted two-sided p-values will be presented for all pairwise comparison of oral semaglutide versus placebo.

Fasting lipid profile endpoints will be log-transformed prior to analysis with the associated log-transformed baseline value as a covariate. No model development of dose-response relationship is planned for these. For evaluation of the primary estimand the MMRM based primary analysis will include all scheduled post-baseline measurement up to and including week 52. From this analysis the estimated treatment differences (ratios) between each of the oral semaglutide dose levels and placebo at week 26 and 52 and between each of the oral semaglutide dose levels and liraglutide 0.9 mg at week 26 and week 52 together with associated two-sided 95% CIs and unadjusted two-sided p-values will be presented for all pairwise comparison of oral semaglutide versus placebo and versus liraglutide 0.9 mg. For evaluation of the secondary estimand the analysis will be performed separately for week 26 and 52. For the analysis at week 52, the imputation of missing data will be further differentiated by whether subjects have discontinued trial product or initiated rescue medication prior to week 26 or at or after week 26. This will result in imputation of missing data within 20 groups of subjects instead of the 10 groups as described for the week 26 evaluation in Section 17.3.2 . If less than 5 subjects have available data in one of the 20 groups, the imputation will be made within the 10 groups specified for the primary evaluation. The frequency of missing data is expected to be slightly larger at week 52 compared to week 26. The rate of missing data is expected to decline over time.

Time to event endpoint !Time to rescue medication The endpoint will be analysed based on FAS using both the on-treatment observation period and the in-trial observation period. For the analysis based on the on-treatment observation period, subject without need for rescue medication during the on-treatment observation period will be censored at the time point of the date of last trial product. For the in-trial period subject without need for addition of glucose-lowering medication during the in-trial observation period, will be censored at the time point of the date of end of the in-trial observation period. For this analysis, the follow-up period will be excluded from the in-trial observation period, since subjects will have to stop treatment at the end-of-treatment visit and therefore might need addition of glucose-lowering medication during the follow-up period. The endpoint will be described and compared for oral semaglutide versus placebo and versus liraglutide 0.9 mg using likelihood ratio tests obtained from a Cox proportional hazards model with treatment and stratification factor as categorical fixed effects and baseline HbA 1cas a covariate.

Treatment emergent: hypoglycaemic episodes will be defined as treatment-emergent if the onset of the episode occurs within the on-treatment observation period (see definition of observation periods in Section 17.2). Nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes: episodes occurring between 00:01 and 05.59 both inclusive. Hypoglycaemic episodes are classified according to the Novo Nordisk classification of hypoglycaemia and the ADA classification of hypoglycaemia (see Figure 17.1). Novo Nordisk classification of hypoglycaemia In normal physiology, symptoms of hypoglycaemia occur below a PG level of 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL)48. Therefore, Novo Nordisk has included hypoglycaemia with PG levels below this cut- off point in the definition of BG confirmed hypoglycaemia. Novo Nordisk uses the following classification in addition to the ADA classification: !Severe or BG confirmed symptomatic hypogly caemia: An epis ode that is severe according to the ADA classification40or BG confirmed by a PG value < 3.1 mmol/L (56 mg/dL) with symptoms consistent with hypoglycaemia.CONFIDENTIAL"

The model will include treatment and stratification factor as fixed factors and baseline HbA 1c as covariate.

The sections below describe the important identified and potential risks and precautions associated with oral semaglutide treatment. These are based on findings in nonclinical studies and clinical trials with oral semaglutide as well as other GLP-1 RAs. For each of these risks and precautions, mitigating actions have been implemented to minimise the risks for subjects enrolled in this trial. Identified risks Gastrointestinal adverse events Consistent with findings with other GLP-1 RAs, the most frequently reported AEs in clinical trials with oral semaglutide have been gastrointestinal disorders (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, dyspepsia and constipation). Clinical trials have indicated that a low starting dose and gradual dose escalation mitigates the risk of gastrointestinal AEs. Consequently, a low starting dose and dose escalation with 4 week dose-escalation steps have been implemented in the trial. Potential risks Medullary thyroid cancer The human relevance of the proliferative C-cell changes found in rodents treated with GLP-1 RAs is unknown, but data suggest that rodents are more sensitive to the mode of action of GLP-1 RAs for induction of C-cell tumours. However, as a precaution, subjects with a family or personal history of MEN 2 or MTC will not be enrolled in the trial. During the trial, calcitonin will be measured on a regular basis, and the guidance for investigators on further evaluation and action on elevated calcitonin concentrations is included in appendix A. Acute pancreatitis Acute pancreatitis has been reported in subjects treated with GLP-1 RAs including oral semaglutide. As a precaution, subjects with a history of acute or chronic pancreatitis will not be enrolled in the trial. Also, subjects will be informed about the symptoms of acute pancreatitis and serum levels of lipase and amylase will be monitored throughout the trial.CONFIDENTIAL"

There is currently no support from nonclinical studies or clinical trials or post-marketing data that GLP-1-based therapies increase the risk of pancreatic cancer. However, pancreatic cancer has been included as a separate potential risk due to the scientific debate surrounding a potential association to GLP-1-based therapies and the unknown long-term effects of stimulation of β-cells and suppression of α-cells. Pancreatic cancer has been classified as a potential class risk of GLP-1 RAs by EMA. Allergic reactions As in the case with all protein-based pharmaceuticals, treatment with oral semaglutide may evoke allergic reactions. These may include urticaria, rash, pruritus as well as anaphylactic reactions. As a precaution, subjects with known or suspected hypersensitivity to trial product(s) or related products will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, subjects will be instructed to contact the site staff as soon as possible for further guidance if suspicion of a hypersensitivity reaction to the trial product occurs. Hypoglycaemia Based on current knowledge about the GLP-1 RA drug class, there is a risk of hypoglycaemic episodes. Hypoglycaemic episodes have mainly been observed when a GLP-1 RA is combined with sulphonylurea or insulin. The risk for development of hypoglycaemia with oral semaglutide in combination with sulphonylurea and insulin is currently unknown. Acute renal impairment In subjects treated with GLP-1 RAs, including oral semaglutide, gastrointestinal AEs such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea may lead to significant dehydration and secondary acute renal impairment. Subjects with gastrointestinal AEs are recommended to drink plenty of fluids to avoid volume depletion. Also, serum creatinine and other markers of kidney function will be monitored throughout the trial. If rescue medication is indicated it should be in accordance with the current, approved labels. SGLT-2 inhibitors, an allowed rescue medication, have also been associated with volume depletion. It is recommended to monitor renal function and for signs and symptoms of fluid loss during therapy. Severe dehydration may be a risk factor for ketoacidosis. Impaired renal function may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis when GLP-1 RAs are co-administered with metformin. In case subject is treated with metformin as a rescue medication and experiences prolonged or severe nausea and vomiting, the investigator should CONFIDENTIAL"

Other safety considerations Diabetic retinopathy A transient worsening of diabetic retinopathy is a recognised complication in selected patients with diabetes after initiation of intensive antidiabetic treatment49,50,51. Risk factors for these events include long-standing poor glycaemic control and presence of proliferative retinopathy, and initial large improvements in blood glucose may be an additional aggravating factor. Several studies have, however, documented long-term beneficial effects of intensive glycaemic treatment in reducing retinopathy progression4,52even in intensively treated patients who experienced early worsening50. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial with s.c. semaglutide, results indicate an increased risk of events related to diabetic retinopathy in subjects treated with semaglutide compared to placebo. As a precaution in this trial, all subjects are required to have a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy performed before enrolment into the trial; moreover, subjects with proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring acute treatment will be excluded. Teratogenicity (embryo-foetal development toxicity) Semaglutide caused embryo-foetal malformations in the rat through a GLP-1 receptor mediated effect on the inverted yolk sac placenta leading to impaired nutrient supply to the developing embryo. Primates do not have an inverted yolk sac placenta which makes this mechanism unlikely to be of relevance to humans. However, as a precaution, females who are pregnant, breast-feeding or intend to become pregnant or are of childbearing potential and not using an adequate contraceptive method will not be enrolled in the trial. In addition, pregnancy tests will be performed at all visits, including screening and follow-up and at any time during the trial if a menstrual period is missed. General precautions All subjects will be included after a thorough evaluation with regards to in- and exclusion criteria defined in order to ensure that subjects are eligible for trial treatment. There are also strict glyacemic rescue criteria in place to ensure acceptable glycaemic control during the trial. If rescue medication is required, it should be in accordance with ADA/European Association for the Study of Diabetes 28,29(excluding GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4 inhibitors and amylin analogues). It is the responsibility of the investigator to ensure the best possible care according to clinical practice in Japan and/or the principles outlined in Diabetes Care 2016 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes53.CONFIDENTIAL"

Also, dehydration, renal impairment and pancreatitis have been reported26. From clinical trials and marketed use, overdoses have been reported of up to 72 mg. Generally, the patients reported severe nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. None of the patients reported severe hypoglycaemia. All patients recovered without complications. In the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the patient's clinical signs and symptoms 18.1.3 Risks and precautions with placebo There will be strict glycaemic rescue criteria in place to ensure acceptable glycaemic control for all treatment arms at all times during the trial. Subjects will in case of unacceptable, persistent hyperglycaemia be offered treatment intensification (rescue medication) at the discretion of the investigator. 18.1.4 Benefits In this trial, subjects will be randomised 1:1:1:1:1 to either one of the 3 dose levels of semaglutide, liraglutide or placebo. The majority of the patients will be treated with a treatment regimen anticipated to be equally or more efficacious than the treatment they received at the time of trial entry. Based on the results of the phase 2 dose finding trial, oral semaglutide is expected to provide clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control and body weight in subjects with T2DM. Similarly, treatment with liraglutide is expected to provide clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control 26. In addition, it is expected that all subjects, including subjects randomised to placebo, will benefit from participation through close contact with the trial site, with close follow-up of their T2DM and a careful medical examination; all of which will most likely result in an intensified management of their T2DM. All subjects in this trial will receive trial products and auxiliary supplies free of charge. 18.1.5 Risk and benefit conclusion CONFIDENTIAL"

The phase 2 results indicate that oral semaglutide will provide clinically relevant improvements in glycaemic control and body weight. Liraglutide is already a marketed drug approved for the use in subjects with T2DM. Safety and efficacy will be monitored regularly and acceptable glycaemic control will be reinforced at all times during the trial. In conclusion, the potential risk to the subjects in this trial is considered low and acceptable in view of the anticipated benefits oral semaglutide/liraglutide would provide to subjects with T2DM. 18.2 Informed consent In seeking and documenting informed consent, the investigator must comply with applicable regulatory requirement(s) and adhere to ICH GCP1and the requirements in the Declaration of Helsinki2. Before any trial-related activity, the investigator must give the subject verbal and written information about the trial and the procedures involved in a form that the subject can read and understand. The subjects must be fully informed of their rights and responsibilities while participating in the trial as well as possible disadvantages of being treated with the trial products. The investigator must ensure the subject ample time to come to a decision whether or not to participate in the trial. A voluntary, signed and personally dated informed consent must be obtained from the subject before any trial-related activity.

If deviations do occur, the investigator must inform the monitor and the implications of the deviation must be reviewed and discussed. Deviations must be documented and explained in a protocol deviation by stating the reason, date and the action(s) taken. Some deviations, for which corrections are not possible, can be acknowledged and confirmed via edit checks in the eCRF or via listings from the trial database. Documentation on protocol deviations must be kept in the investigator trial master file and sponsor trial master file. 19.2 Prevention of missing data The importance of subject retention will be addressed by Novo Nordisk in the training and communication with the trial sites. The subjects will be carefully informed about the trial procedures before signing informed consent, so that they know the implications of participating in the trial. Close surveillance of subject retention will be performed throughout the trial by Novo Nordisk with focus on reasons for premature discontinuation of trial product or withdrawal of consent to secure early mitigations in collaboration with the trial sites. The investigator will make every effort to ensure that all assessments are performed and data is collected. If missing data does occur the reason will be collected via the protocol deviation process, see Section 19.1. Novo Nordisk will monitor protocol deviations on an on-going basis throughout the trial followed by appropriate actions (e.g. re-training of site staff).CONFIDENTIAL"

If any tasks are delegated, the investigator must maintain a log of appropriately qualified persons to whom he/she has delegated specified trial- related duties. The investigator must ensure that there is adequate and documented training for all staff participating in the conduct of the trial. It is the investigator’s responsibility to supervise the conduct of the trial and to protect the rights, safety, and well-being of the subjects. A qualified physician, who is an investigator or a sub-investigator for the trial, must be responsible for all trial-related medical decisions. The investigator will follow instructions from Novo Nordisk when processing data. The investigator is responsible for filing essential documents (i.e. those documents which individually and collectively permit evaluation of the conduct of a trial and the quality of the data produced) in the investigator trial master file. The documents including the subject identification code list must be kept in a secure locked facility, so no unauthorized persons can get access to the data. The investigator will take all necessary technical and organisational safety measures to prevent accidental or wrongful destruction, loss or deterioration of data. The investigator will prevent any unauthorised access to data or any other processing of data against applicable law. The investigator must be able to provide the necessary information or otherwise demonstrate to Novo Nordisk that such technical and organisational safety measures have been taken. During any period of unavailability, the investigator must delegate responsibility for medical care of subjects to a specific qualified physician who will be readily available to subjects during that time. If the investigator is no longer able to fulfil the role as investigator (e.g. if he/she moves or retires), a new investigator will be appointed in consultation with Novo Nordisk. The investigator and other site personnel must have sufficient English skills according to their assigned task(s).CONFIDENTIAL"

All information supplied by Novo Nordisk in connection with this trial shall remain the sole property of Novo Nordisk and is to be considered confidential information. No confidential information shall be disclosed to others without prior written consent from Novo Nordisk. Such information shall not be used except in the performance of this trial. The information obtained during this trial may be made available to other physicians who are conducting other clinical trials with the trial product, if deemed necessary by Novo Nordisk. Provided that certain conditions are fulfilled, Novo Nordisk may grant access to information obtained during this trial to researchers who require access for research projects studying the same disease and/or trial product studied in this trial. Novo Nordisk may publish on its clinical trials website a redacted clinical trial report for this trial. One or two investigators will be appointed by Novo Nordisk to review and sign the clinical trial report (signatory investigator) on behalf of all participating investigators. The signatory investigator(s) will be appointed based upon the criteria defined by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors for research publications54. 23.1 Communication of results Novo Nordisk commits to communicating, and otherwise making available for public disclosure, results of trials regardless of outcome. Public disclosure includes publication of a paper in a scientific journal, abstract submission with a poster or oral presentation at a scientific meeting, or disclosure by other means. The results of this trial will be subject to public disclosure on external web sites according to international and national regulations, as reflected in the Novo Nordisk Code of Conduct for Clinical Trial Disclosure30. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to defer the release of data until specified milestones are reached, for example when the clinical trial report is available. This includes the right not to release the results of interim analyses, because the release of such information may influence the results of the entire trial. At the end of the trial, one or more scientific publications may be prepared collaboratively by the investigator(s) and Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to postpone publication and/or communication for up to 60 days to protect intellectual property.CONFIDENTIAL"

All authors will be given the relevant statistical tables, figures, and reports needed to evaluate the planned publication. In the event of any disagreement on the content of any publication, both the investigators’ and Novo Nordisk opinions will be fairly and sufficiently represented in the publication. Where required by the journal, the investigator from each trial site will be named in an acknowledgement or in the supplementary material, as specified by the journal. Novo Nordisk maintains the right to be informed of plans by any investigator to publish and to review any scientific paper, presentation, communication or other information concerning the investigation described in this protocol. Any such communication must be submitted in writing to Novo Nordisk before submission for comments. Comments will be given within four weeks from receipt of the planned communication. 23.1.1 Authorship Authorship of publications should be in accordance with the Uniform Requirements of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors54(sometimes referred to as the Vancouver Criteria). Novo Nordisk will appoint investigator(s) to prepare publications in collaboration with Novo Nordisk. 23.1.2 Site-specific publication(s) by investigator(s) For a multi-centre clinical trial, analyses based on single-site data usually have significant statistical limitations and frequently do not provide meaningful information for healthcare professionals or subjects, and therefore may not be supported by Novo Nordisk. It is a Novo Nordisk policy that such individual reports do not precede the primary manuscript and should always reference the primary manuscript of the trial. Novo Nordisk reserves the right to prior review of such publications. Further to allow for the primary manuscript to be published as the first, Novo Nordisk asks for deferment of publication of individual site results until the primary manuscript is accepted for publication. As Novo Nordisk wants to live up to the industry publication policy, submission of a primary publication will take place no later than 18 months after trial completion. 23.2 Investigator access to data and review of results As owner of the trial database, Novo Nordisk has the discretion to determine who will have access to the database. Individual investigators will have their own research subjects' data, and will be provided with the randomisation code after results are available.CONFIDENTIAL"

The investigator must agree to archive the documentation (this includes both electronic and paper- based records) pertaining to the trial in an archive after completion or discontinuation of the trial if not otherwise notified. The investigator should not destroy any documents without prior permission from Novo Nordisk. If the investigator cannot archive the documents at the trial site, Novo Nordisk can refer the investigator to an independent archive provider that has a system in place to allow only the investigator to access the files. The investigator must be able to access his/her trial documents without involving Novo Nordisk in any way. Site-specific CRFs and other subject data (in an electronic readable format or as paper copies or prints) will be provided to the investigator before access is revoked to the systems and/or electronic devices supplied by Novo Nordisk. These data must be retained by the trial site. If the provided data (e.g. the CD-ROM) is not readable during the entire storage period, the investigator can request a new copy. A copy of all data will be stored by Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk will maintain Novo Nordisk documentation pertaining to the trial for at least 20 years after discontinuation of the marketing authorisation, termination of the trial or cancellation of the research project whichever is longest. The files from the trial site/institution must be retained for 15 years after end of trial as defined in Section 7, or longer if required by local regulations or Novo Nordisk. In any case trial files cannot be destroyed until the trial site/institution is notified by Novo Nordisk. The deletion process must ensure confidentiality of data and must be done in accordance with local regulatory requirements. 24.2 Retention of human biosamples Antibody samples may be retained for later analysis for further characterisation of antibody responses towards drug if required by health authorities or for safety reasons. The samples will be stored at a central bio-repository after end of trial and until marketing authorisation approval or until the research project terminates, but no longer than 15 years from end of trial after which they will be destroyed. The subject’s identity will remain confidential and the antibody samples will be identified only by subject number, visit number and trial identification number. No direct identification of the subject will be stored together with the samples.CONFIDENTIAL"

The human relevance of this finding is unknown. However, based on the findings in rodents, monitoring of serum calcitonin (a sensitive biomarker for C-cell activation) is currently being performed in clinical trials with semaglutide. While there is general agreement on the clinical interpretation of substantially elevated calcitonin levels (greater than 100 ng/L) as likely indicative of C-cell neoplasia, the interpretation of values between upper normal range (5.0 and 8.4 ng/L for women and men, respectively) and 100 ng/L is less clear with regards to indication of disease. There are several known confounding factors affecting calcitonin levels, e.g.: !renal dysfunction !smoking !autoimmune thyroiditis !several drug classes (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, beta-blockers, H 2-blockers and glucocorticoids) Physiology of C-cell activation in various clinical conditions and in different patient populations (i.e. with various co-morbidities) is poorly understood. There may be various clinical conditions not identified so far which mildly or moderately affect calcitonin secretion by C-cells.CONFIDENTIAL"

Diagnostic evaluation should include: !thyroid ultrasound examination !fine needle aspiration of any nodules > 1 cm !potentially surgery with neck dissection In case a subject is diagnosed with MTC, it is common clinical practice to explore the family history of MTC or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) and perform a genetic test for RET proto-oncogene mutation. 2.2 Calcitonin ≥ 50 and < 100 ng/L Action: The subject should be referred to a thyroid specialist for further evaluation. The subject should remain in the trial and continuation on trial product should be based on the evaluation done by the thyroid specialist. Background: These values were found in 8 (0.14%) of the population of 5817 patients with thyroid nodular disease1.

The onset of the pain may be swift reaching maximum intensity within 30 min, it is frequently unbearable and characteristically persists for more than 24 hours without relief1. The pain is often associated with nausea and vomiting. Physical examination usually reveals severe upper abdominal tenderness at times associated with guarding. In general, both amylase and lipase are elevated during the course of acute pancreatitis. The serum lipase may remain elevated slightly longer than amylase. The level of the serum amylase and/or lipase does not correlate with the severity of acute pancreatitis1. In general, serum lipase is thought to be more sensitive and specific than serum amylase in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. In case of suspicion of acute pancreatitis, the trial product should promptly be interrupted (no treatment discontinuation call should be made in the interactive web response system (IWRS) before diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed). Appropriate additional examinations must be performed, including local measurement of amylase and lipase. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires two of the following three features2: !abdominal pain consistent with acute pancreatitis (acute onset of a persistent, severe, epigastric pain often radiating to the back) !serum lipase activity (and/or amylase activity) at least three times greater than the upper limit of normal !characteristic findings of acute pancreatitis on imaging. If acute pancreatitis is ruled out, trial product should be re-initiated.If acute pancreatitis is confirmed, appropriate treatment and careful monitoring of the subject should be initiated.

Change in allowance of eye examinations and additional data collection on diabetic retinopathy 2. Investigator’s responsibility in ensuring evaluation and management of certain risk factors and complications 3. Clarification of the criteria for completion, withdrawal and lost to follow-up 4. Other minor corrections and clarifications 1.1 Additional eye examinations and additional data collection on diabetic retinopathy Protocol sections updated: 2, 4.2.2.2, 8.4.1.2, 8.4.4, 12.1.5, 17.2, 17.4.1.2, 18.1.1, 27; Appendix B section 1 and 1.14 (new). Transient worsening of diabetic retinopathy is a recognised complication in selected patients with diabetes after initiation of intensive antidiabetic treatment1,2,3. Risk factors for these events include long-standing poor glycaemic control and presence of proliferative retinopathy, and initial large improvements in blood glucose may be an additional aggravating factor. In a recently completed cardiovascular outcomes trial with s.c. semaglutide, results indicate an increased risk of events related to diabetic retinopathy in subjects treated with semaglutide compared to placebo 4. The majority of the related adverse events were moderate in severity and did not lead to premature discontinuation of trial product. Also, to further understand this safety signal, additional information will be collected for all diabetic retinopathy events reported during the trial. Furthermore, information to the investigators and subjects related to diabetic retinopathy has been added to the protocol (see Section 18). The timepoint of the eye examination taken at end of treatment (EoT; visit 12 or visit 12A) has been moved to ensure the treatment is completed or finished as for other assessments performed at EoT. 1Dahl-Jørgensen K, Brinchmann-Hansen O, Hanssen KF, Sandvik L, Aagenaes O.

In addition, text is added to highlight the investigator’s responsibility in ensuring evaluation and management of cardiovascular risk factors and microvascular complications such as diabetic kidney disease and diabetic retinopathy. 1.3 Clarification of the criteria for completion, withdrawal and lost to follow-up Updated sections in the protocol: 6.6, 8.1.5, 8.1.6, 8.1.7.1 The criteria for subject completion, -withdrawal and -lost to follow-up respectively are clarified and have been made consistent across sections. Lost to follow-up is considered a subcategory to withdrawal from trial. In addition, it is emphasised that as soon as contact to a subject is lost, efforts must be made to regain contact and the efforts must continue until the subjects last planned visit. Only if contact is not regained at that time point can the subject be considered lost to follow up. Because this trial is not an outcome trial the terminology ‘health status’ is replaced with “relevant safety information” - the purpose of which is to follow up on any adverse events or pregnancy, and not to determine if a subject completes the trial or not. 1.4 Other minor adjustments, clarifications and correction of typographical errors Laboratory analysis Updated sections in the protocol: 8.4.8 The protocol currently specifies that the in vitro neutralising antibody assays will be performed by Novo Nordisk, however, it may be decided by Novo Nordisk that the laboratory currently responsible for antibody binding analysis (Celerion) will perform the assay.

A subject who does not complete the trial is also considered withdrawn from the trial. Hence a subject is considered withdrawn if the following applies: !Subject withdrew consent !Subject is lost to follow up (only to be used if there is no contact with the subject by the time of the subject’s last scheduled visit, see sections 8.1.5 – 8.1.7.1) !Other (subject deceased or closure of trial site) 2.4 Section 8.1.5 End-of-treatment (visit 12) and Follow-up (visit 13) Subjects, who stay on trial product throughout the trial, must attend the End-of-treatment visit (visit 12) 52 weeks after randomisation ( ±3 days visit window) and the Follow-up visit (visit 13) 5 weeks after the last date on trial product (+3 days visit window). A completion call must be performed in the IWRS after completion of visit 12 (see Section 10). At visit 12 the subject should be reminded about the importance of attending the follow-up visit (visit 13). If the subject, nonetheless, does not attend visit 13, the site should make efforts to obtain contact with the subject within the visit window. A trial completer is defined as a subject who attends, or is in contact with the site, at the subject’s last scheduled visit. For subjects who complete treatment, the last scheduled visit is visit 13. (For subjects who discontinue trial product, see Section 8.1.6) In case the subject cannot be reached (by clinic visit or phone contact) at the scheduled visit 13, the site should consult the contacts provided by the subject (e.g. close relatives), relevant physicians and medical records to collect health status. If no health status can be collected, the subject should be considered lost to follow-up and this should be specified in the end-of-trial form. 2.5 Section 8.1.6 Premature discontinuation of trial product and follow-up (visits 12A and 13A) ... Subjects should continue with the originally scheduled site contacts after visit 13A and up to and including visit 12. If necessary, in order to retain the subject in the trial, site visits can be replaced by phone contacts after visit 13A. However, as a minimum, these subjects should be asked to attend the scheduled visit 8 at week 26 and end-of-treatment (visit 12) at week 52 as these visits should be performed for all subjects, if at all possible (except subjects who withdraw informed consent, see Section 8.1.7).CONFIDENTIAL"

In case the subject cannot be reached (by clinic visit or phone contact) at the scheduled visit 12, the site should consult the contacts provided by the subject (e.g. close relatives), relevant physicians and medical records to collect health status. If no health status can be collected, the subject should be considered lost to follow-up and this should be specified in the end-of-trial form. A subject who prematurely discontinued trial product is still considered a trial completer if the subject attends or is in contact with the site, at the subject’s last scheduled visit. For subjects who prematurely discontinue trial product, the last scheduled visit is visit 12 (or visit 13A if it is scheduled after visit 12). The site should in due time prepare for establishing contact with the subject within the visit window of the scheduled visit 8 and visit 12, respectively if the subject has agreed to attend these visits. In summary, subjects should stay in the trial irrespective of lack of adherence to randomised treatment, lack of adherence to visit schedule, missing assessments or trial product discontinuation for any reason. Only subjects who decline any further contact with the site in relation to the trial should be considered as having withdrawn consent from the trial (for withdrawal procedures, see Section 8.1.7). 2.6 Section 8.1.7.1 Lost to follow-up In case contact to the subject is lost during the trial, the site should immediately undertake efforts to re-establish contact. If the subject cannot be reached (by clinic visit or phone contact) and the subject has consented to it, the site should consult the contacts provided by the subject (e.g. close relatives), relevant physicians and medical records in an attempt to regain contact with the subject or to obtain relevant safety information from other sources. Efforts to regain contact should continue until the end of the subject’s last scheduled visit: visit 13 for subjects who have completed treatment, whereas for subjects who have discontinued trial product prematurely the last visit is visit 12 (or visit 13A if it is scheduled after visit 12). Only if contact with the subject is not regained by the end of the visit window of the last scheduled visit can the subject be considered lost to follow up (see Section 6.6). 2.7 Section 8.4.1.2 Adverse events requiring additional data collection For the following AEs additional data collection is required and specific event forms must be completed in the eCRF in addition to the AE form: !Acute coronary syndrome (MI or unstable angina pectoris requiring hospitalisation) !Cerebrovascular event (stroke or transient ischaemic attack[TIA])CONFIDENTIAL"

Missing values for each group will be imputed as follows: !An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with stratification factor as a categorical fixed effect and baseline HbA 1cmeasurement as a covariate will be fitted to observed values of the change from baseline in HbA 1cat week 26. !The estimated parameters for location and dispersion will be used to impute 100 1000 values for each subject with missing week 26 data based on stratification factor and baseline HbA 1c. Thus, 100 1000 complete data sets will be generated including observed and imputed values. Analysis used for testing superiority versus placebo at week 26: For each of the 100 1000 (now complete) imputed data sets the change from baseline to week 26 in HbA 1cwill be analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and stratification factor as categorical fixed effects and baseline HbA 1cas covariate. The results obtained from analysing the datasets will be combined using Rubin’s rule4748to draw inference. 2.14 Section 17.4.1.1 Efficacy endpoints For evaluation of the secondary estimand the analysis will be performed separately for week 26 and 52. For the analysis at week 52, the imputation of missing data will be further differentiated by whether subjects have discontinued trial product or initiated rescue medication prior to week 26 or at or /after week 26. This will result in imputation of missing data within 20 15groups of subjects instead of the 10 groups as described for the week 26 evaluation in Section 17.3.2. If less than 5 subjects have available data in one of the 20 15groups, the imputation will be made within the 10 groups specified for the primary evaluation. The frequency of missing data is expected to be slightly larger at week 52 compared to week 26. The rate of missing data is expected to decline over time. Binary efficacy endpoints … To account for missing data, the analysis will be made using a sequential multiple imputation approach as described below: !Multiple imputed data sets (100 1000 ) will be created in which missing values for the underlying continuous assessments are imputed by treatment group and treatment CONFIDENTIAL"

Risk factors for these events include long-standing poor glycaemic control and presence of proliferative retinopathy, and initial large improvements in blood glucose may be an additional aggravating factor. Several studies have, however, documented long-term beneficial effects of intensive glycaemic treatment in reducing retinopathy progression4, 52 53even in intensively treated patients who experienced early worsening5051. In a cardiovascular outcomes trial with s.c. semaglutide, results indicate an increased risk of events related to diabetic retinopathy in subjects treated with semaglutide compared to placebo54. As a precaution in this trial, all subjects are required to have a fundus photography or dilated fundoscopy performed before enrolment into the trial; moreover, subjects with proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy requiring acute treatment will be excluded. As part of good diabetes management the investigator is encouraged to ensure adequate monitoring and treatment of diabetic retinopathy in subjects enrolled into the trial 55 ...
