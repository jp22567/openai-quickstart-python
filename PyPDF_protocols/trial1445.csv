Changes to oral diuretic therapy do not qualify as initiation or intensification of treatment. Secondary Objective s:  to evaluate the effects of OM on time to:  CV death  HF hospitalization  all-cause death  to evaluate the effects of treatment with OM on change in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) Safety Objective:  to evaluate the safety of OM as measured by subject incidence of reported adverse events, including serious adverse events of ventricular arrhythmias requiring treatment and positively adjudicated major cardiac ischemic events (fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina hospitalization, and coronary revascularization) ( Hicks et al, 2015 ) Hypotheses: The primary hypothesis is that when added to SoC, OM is well tolerated and superior to placebo in reducing the risk of CV death or HF events in subjects with chronic HFrEF. Secondary hypotheses are that OM reduces the individual risks of:  CV death  HF hospitalization  all-cause death and improves symptoms in subjects with chronic HFrEF compared to placebo.

Changes to oral diuretic therapy do not qualify as initiation or intensification of treatment. Secondary Endpoints:  time to CV death  change in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Total Symptoms Score (KCCQ TSS) from baseline to Week 24  time to first HF hospitalization  time to all-cause death Safety Endpoints:  subject incidence of reported adverse events  subject incidence of reported serious adverse events of ventricular arrhythmias requiring treatment  subject incidence of positively adjudicated major cardiac ischemic events  positively adjudicated major cardiac ischemic adverse events are: myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, percutaneous coronary intervention/coronary artery bypass graft ( Hicks et al, 2015 ) Study Design: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group, multicenter, CV outcomes study in subjects with HFrEF, including subjects with ongoing or history of HF hospitalization. The study is event-driven and will conclude when approximately 1590 CV death events have occurred. Approximately 8000 eligible subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either OM or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by randomization setting (currently hospitalized for HF or recently and not currently hospitalized for HF) and region (5 strata: US and Canada; Latin America; Western Europe, South Africa, and Australasia; Eastern Europe including Russia; Asia) . At randomization, all subjects should be managed with standard of care therapies consistent with regional clinical practice guidelines. Approximately 25% or more of the total planned enrollment will include subjects who are hospitalized for HF at randomization. Enrollment of subjects in atrial fibrillation/flutter at screening is limited to approximately 25%. Sample Size: Approximately 8000 subjects will be randomized. Summary of Subject Eligibility Criteria: Subjects must be adults with a history of chronic HF, defined as receiving treatment for HF for a minimum of 30 days before randomization. All subjects should be managed with standard of care therapies consistent with regional clinical practice guidelines according to investigator judgment. Oral SoC therapies for chronic HF (eg, beta blockers, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors) should be present and optimized to the maximally tolerated dose, if not contraindicated. Subjects enrolled during either HF hospitalization or early after HF hospitalization discharge can be reinitiating or titrating oral SoC chronic HF therapies at the time of randomization, per usual clinical practice. For a full list of eligibility criteria, please refer to Section 4.1.1 through Section 4.1.2 . Approved"

Subjects randomized to OM will initiate administration at 25 mg BID. At study visit Week 2 (steady-state for initial dose), a blood sample will be collected from all subjects to determine pharmacokinetic ( PK) predose level. The results will be blinded to investigators. For subjects randomized to OM, the predose plasma concentration at Week 2 will guide the dose adjustment at Week 4 as follows:  Subjects with plasma concentration < 200 ng/mL will start administration of 50 mg BID.  Subjects with plasma concentration ≥ 200 and < 300 ng/mL will start administration of 37.5 mg BID.  Subjects with plasma concentration ≥ 300 and < 1000 ng/mL will maintain the administration of 25 mg BID.  Subjects with plasma concentration ≥ 1000 ng/mL will start administration of placebo BID.  At study visit Week 6, a predose plasma concentration will be collected from all subjects to confirm plasma concentration achieved while subjects are receiving their targeted dose and assess if potential changes to the dose should be made. The results will be blinded to investigators. For further guidance on procedures regarding PK assessment, please refer to Section 6.2.  A new investigational product supply will be provided to a ll subjects at the W eek 4 and Week 8 study visits regardless of randomized treatment group and outcome of the PK assessment in order to maintain the blind. Procedures: Written informed consent must be obtained from all subjects before any screening procedures are performed. The following procedures will occur per the Schedule of Assessments: medical/surgical history, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, physical examination/height, vital signs, weight, adverse event and concomitant medication assessment, electrocardiogram, PRO assessments , pregnancy testing, urinalysis, blood draw for serum chemistry, hematology, n-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide , troponin I, creatine kinase-MB ( CK-MB), biomarkers, and PK samples. For a full list of study procedures, including the timing of each procedure, please refer to Section 7 and the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 ). Statistical Considerations: The primary analysis will include hypothesis testing for each of the primary and secondary endpoints and include analyses of exploratory endpoints. The primary analysis will occur after approximately 1590 CV deaths have occurred . Unless specified otherwise, efficacy analyses will be performed on the full analysis set, which includes all randomized subjects, by randomized treatment group . The safety analyses will be performed on the safety analysis set, which includes all randomized and dosed subjects. Unless otherwise specified, all hypothesis tests will be reported as 2-sided, and the full study will have an overall type I error rate of 0.05. To preserve the overall type I error rate at 0.05, a sequentially rejective multiple test procedure will be used. An interim analysis for superiority is planned when approximately two-thirds of the planned 1590 CV deaths are observed and will use a 2-sided alpha of 0.001 and the same multiplicity adjustments as for the planned primary analysis. Interim analyses for futility based on the primary composite endpoint are planned when approximately one-third and two-thirds of the planned 1590 CV deaths are observed. The primary analysis of the primary composite endpoint will use a likelihood ratio test from a Cox model including baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the treatment group and stratified by randomization setting and region. The secondary endpoints of time to CV death, time to first heart failure hospitalization, and time to all-cause death will be assessed using the same Cox model setup as the primary composite endpoint.

BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 2.1 Disease HF is a clinical syndrome marked by impaired cardiac contractility and is a final pathway for many diseases that affect the heart ( Hilfiker-Kleiner et al, 2006 ). HF affects over 26 million people worldwide, with more than 3.5 million people newly diagnosed every year. The prevalence has been shown to increase with age ( López -Sendón, 2011), suggesting that as the population ages, the incidence of HF may rise . In the United States (US), more than 5 million people, or almost 2.0% of the population, have HF (Go et al, 201 3). In Europe, it has been estimated that at least 15 million people have HF (Dickstein et al, 2008 ). The annual mor tality rate of HFrEF patients in western industrialized countries is typically from 10% to 25% per year; however, depending on the HF severity, this rate can be as low as 5% per year in stable New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I to II HF patients with mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) to as high as 75% per year in patients with NYHA class III to IV and marked LVSD ( Mozaffarian et al, 2007; Bhatia et al, 2006; Levy et al, 2006 ; Solomon et al, 2004). The burden of HF can also be seen in data from recurr ent hospital admission. Medicare data and data on commercially insured patients indicate that 12% to 27% of patients hospitalized for HF are readmitted within 30 days after their hospitalization , and all -cause mortality reaches 12% in the same period (Jencks et al, 2009; McIlvennan et al, 2014 ). HF is most often caused by coronary artery disease; other common causes include idiopathic hypertension and valvular heart disease ( Ambrosy et al, 2014 ). In an attempt to preserve cardiac output and organ perfusion, the condition progresses through stages with compensatory mechanisms characterized by increased sympathetic tone, peripheral vasoconstriction, and activation of various neurohormonal pathways. These adaptive properties provide short-term relief but can be damaging with long-term or prolonged activation. Patients experience dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention and eventually develop pulmonary congestion and peripheral edema.

While several pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions have been shown to reduce the rate of HF hospitalizations and improve mortality, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibit ors (ACEi s), beta -blockers, aldosterone antagonists, coronary revascularization, and biventricular pacing ( Jessup and Brozena , 2003; Krum and Teerlink, 2011), mortality and morbidity still remain high as noted above. In addition, these available treatments, acting on the compensatory mechanisms ( eg, sodium retention, arterial and venous constriction, neuroendocrine activation, and increased heart rate) often fail to control symptoms or restore quality of life. Reduced left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) is a central factor in HF, yet there are no safe medical therapies to directly improve cardiac function at the level of the cardiac sarcomere in HF patients. The compensatory mechanisms cited above are deployed in attempt to preserve cardiac output and organ perfusion in a scenario of impaired myocardial contractility. Attempts to improve cardiac contractility through chronic stimulation of the adrenergic receptor pathway ( eg, dobutamine or ibopamine) or phosphodiesterase inhibitors (ie, milrinone) in chronic HF patients have not been successful ( Tacon et al, 2012 ). Both agents have significant safety liabilities due to their mechanism of action. The increase of intracellular calcium can improve contractility but at the expense of increased tissue ox ygen consumption and arrhythmias. The addition of long -term oral milrinone to SoC in severe chronic HFrEF patients has shown increased mortality and morbidity ( Packer et al, 1991 ). Oral ibopamine, a dopaminergic receptor agonist (DA-1 and DA-2) also did not demonstrate clinical benefits when added to SoC in HFrEF outpatients ( Hampton et al, 1997 ). 2.2 Amgen Investigational Product Background The molecular formula of OM is C20H24FN5O3·2HCl·H2O and the chemical structure is provided in Figure 1 .

OM increases the left ventricular systolic ejection time (SET) without changing the velocity of contraction (dP/dt) or increasing the heart rate. Additionally, left ventricular filling pressures, left atrial pressures, and total peripheral vascular resistance decreased, providing evidence that prolongation of SET and increased systolic function can favorably impact the hemodynamics that drive HF symptoms. The salutary effects of OM were achieved without noticeable effect upon myocardial oxygen uptake, blood pressure, or coronary blood flow ( Shen et al, 2010; Malik et al, 2011 ). 2.2.1 Clinical Experience The clinical development program currently consists of 9 completed phase 1 studies, 4 completed phase 2a studies in subjects with chronic HF, 1 completed phase 2b study in subjects with acute HF, and 1 completed phase 2b study in subjects with chronic HF. The M -F1 formulation was used for 3 phase 1 studies and the phase 2b study in subjects with chronic HF. In addition, 2 studies are ongoing/planned in Japanese subjects using the M-F1 formulation and PK-based dose adjustment strategy; a phase 1b study in healthy subjects (ongoing) and a phase 2b study in subjects with chronic HFrEF. 2.2.2 Studies in Healthy Volunteers CY 1111, a first -in-human clinical study with OM, was a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 4 -period crossover, dose escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK/pharmacodynamic profile of OM administered intravenously to healthy male volunteers (Teerlink et al, 2011 ). This study inclu ded a total of 33 subjects who received infusions of OM at doses ran ging from 0.005 mg/kg/hr to 1.0 mg/kg/hr for up to 6 hours. At an infusion rate of 0.5 mg/kg/hr, given for 6 hours, the average maximum observed concentration (Cmax) was 905 ng/mL. Five subjects received OM infusion of 0.625 mg/kg/hr for 6 hours (average C max = 1203 ng/mL) and tolerated this dose level well. The highest administered dose of 1.0 mg/kg/hr was given to 2 subjects. During the first 3 hours, both subjects tolerated the dosin g rate without difficulty; however, both subjects terminated the infus ion prematurely, in 1 case at 3 hours and 22 minutes and in the other case, at 4 hours and 12 minutes. The plasma concentrations at 3 hours were 1338 ng/mL and 1333 ng/mL, and estimated plasma Approved"

The dose-limiting toxicity of OM in both subjects was consistent with myocardial ischemia or infarction, which included feeling hot, palpitations, chest or throat tightness, dizziness, tachycardia, electrocardiogram (ECG) ST-segment depression, and, in 1 subject, a troponin I elevation in the absence of an increase in creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) fraction. These findings appeared consistent with preclinical experience in dogs at similar plasma concentrations. Across the dosing levels evaluated in CY 1111, OM infusions demonstrated generally linear PK with dose-proportional increases in C max. Concentration-dependent pharmacodynamic effects on cardiac function as measured by echocardiography were observed. These pharmacodynamic effects included statistically significant placebo corrected increases from baseline in SET, Doppler-derived stroke volume, LVEF, and fractional shortening. CY 1013 was an open-label, parallel group study in healthy male volunteers designed to understand the potential for certain drug-drug interactions. To define the contribution of the cytochrome P450 isozymes 3A4 and 2D6 to the metabolism of oral OM in humans, 8 subjects who were extensive metabolizers with respect to their CYP2D6 genotype received the potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole, and 9 extensive metabolizers subjects the moderately potent inhibitor, diltiazem, dosed to steady-st ate to evaluate the PK parameters of a single dose of OM. In addition, 8 subjects who were poor metabolizers with respect to their defined CYP2D6 genotype received oral OM and ketoconazole. In the 24 subjects who completed the study (8 in each group), CY P3A4 inhibition by ketoconazole resulted in approximately 50% and 30% increases in area under the curve (AUC) in extensive metabolizers and poor metabolizer subjects, respectively; but had little impact on C max. Diltiazem had no effect on either the C or AUC of OM in extensive metabolizers subjects. OM was well tolerated in the study with no serious adverse events. These data suggest that CYP3A and CYP2D6 may not be the major enzymes contributing to the metabolism of OM. Studies CY 1011, CY 1015, and CY 1016 were designed to evaluate the PK parameters of oral preparations of OM, with immediate release (CY 1011 and CY1015) and modified release (CY1016) . The studies enrolled a total of 44 males and 20 females. Maximal duration of exposure was 10 days and maximal dose was 30 mg 3 times a day for 7 days.

A total 45 patients (39 males and 6 females) were enrolled and treated with IV study drug infusions ranging from 2 to 72 hours ( Cleland et al, 2011 ). Three patients experienced serious adverse events (non -ST-elevation myocardial infarction which occurred in the setting of an inadvertent drug overdose [this event was considered related to study drug and reported as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction] ; septicemia in the setting of a diabetic foot ulcer that was considered unrelated to study drug; and pneumonia that was considered unrelated to study drug) in the study. OM produced increases in echocardiographic indices of cardiac systolic function. Study CY 1221 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled HF patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and angina with LVEF ≤ 35%. A total of 94 subjects were enrolled and treated with 20 hour IV infusions of study drug followed by 7 days of oral dosing; 29 subjects received placebo, 31 received OM at a lower dose regimen, and 34 at a higher dose regimen. The primary safety endpoint was defined as the proportion of subjects stopping an exercise tolerance test during infusion due to unacceptable angina at an exercise stage earlier than baseli ne. This endpoint was observed in 1 subject receiving placebo and did not occur in any subject receiving OM at either dose regimen. In addition, no consistent differences were observed between placebo and lower or higher dosing regimens of OM with respec t to any of the secondary safety endpoints, vital signs, ECGs, or cardiac enzymes. CY 1021 was an open-label with the objective to evaluate the PK and tolerability of a n oral modified release ( MR) and an oral immediate release (IR) formulation of OM in patients with stable HF. A total of 35 subjects were enrolled and treated with a dose of 50 mg MR twice a day (BID), 37.5 mg IR 3 times a day, or 100 mg MR BID under fed conditions.

Shortly after the last dose on d ay 6, the patient suddenly lost consciousness and died. Based on day 1 plasma concentr ations, the predicted range of d ay 6 plasma concentration s were approximately 120 to 210 ng/mL. Of the 122 healthy volunteers and 147 HF subjects who received at least 1 dose of OM in all of the studies described above, 3 subjects (CY 1111, Subject ; CY 1121, Subject ; and CY 1121, Subject ) experienced a clinical syndrome consistent with myocardial ischemia (feeling hot, palpitations, chest or throat tightness, dizziness, tachycardia, ECG ST-segment depression, positive cardiac markers) that occurred at OM plasma concentrations > 1200 ng/mL, although plasma concentrations of OM exceeding 1200 ng/mL have not always been associated with signs of ischemia. In each of these cases, symptoms and signs resolved rapidly with discontinuation of study drug, no new wall motion abnormalities appeared, and overall left ventricular function was unaffected. An additional 6 HF subjects had troponin I levels > upper reference limit at OM plasma concentrations < 1200 ng/mL. Of these 6 subjects, 1 subject (CY 1221, Subject ) developed troponin elevation only after stenting of the left anterior descending artery, and another subject (CY 1121, Subject ) had marked hypertension prior to and during drug administration. Two subjects enrolled in an invasive hemodynamic and cardiac function study (CY 1124, Subjects and ) had troponin I levels > upper reference limit after their procedures in the absence of symptoms or ECG changes. While manipulation of catheters in the right and left ventricles has been reported to be associated with increased troponin levels (Kannankeril et al, 2002 ), a drug association of these troponin elevations cannot be ruled out. The clinical significance of elevated troponins just above the URL in the remaining 2 subjects is unclear. The phase 2b Study 20100754 (ATOMIC -AHF) was designed to address key questions regarding the relationship between OM plasma concentrations and its safety, tolerability, and efficacy in an intensively monitored, acutely decompensated patient population hospitalized for acute HF. Study 20100754 was a double -blind, randomize d, placebo-controlled study of 3 ascending dose cohorts in which IV OM or matching placebo was infused over 48 hours. In each cohort, OM was administered as a loading dose infusion over 4 hours and a maintenance infusion over the remaining 44 hours. Approved"

Secondary objectives included assessment of the safety a nd toler ability of 3 dose levels of intravenous OM, as well as additional dyspnea assessments, patient global assessment, changes in levels of NT -proBNP, other short-term clinical outcomes, and characterization of the PK of OM and metabolites, including the relationship between OM plasma concentrations and echocardiographic parameters (PK/pharmacodynamic substudy). A total of 606 subjects comprised the full analysis set (OM, n = 303). In subjects hospitalized due to acute decompensated HF (Study 201 00754), OM given as a 48 hour intravenous infusion did not significantly improve dyspnea symptom response defined as minimally, moderately, or markedly better by 7-point Likert scale at 6 hours after investigational product (IP) initiation, and moderately or markedly better at 24 and 48 hours after IP initiation without worsening of HF or death from any cause by 48 hours (p = 0.331). A numeric trend toward a reduction in the incidence of death from any cause or worsening of HF or worsening of HF alone within 7 days of IP initiation was observed at higher OM doses compared with placebo. OM did not significantly reduce NT-proBNP levels compared with pooled placebo. Subject incidence rates for all treatment emergent adverse events were 58% in the pooled OM group and 63% in the pooled placebo group. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were cardiac failure (16.5% pooled placebo, 13.5% pooled OM), hypotension (4.6% pooled placebo, 7.9% pooled OM), and hypokalemia (5.9% pooled placebo, 6.6% pooled OM). The incidence of treatment-emergent serious adverse events was similar between the pooled OM and pooled placebo groups (21.8% and 23.1%, respectively). Serious treatment-emergent adverse event preferred terms (PTs) that were reported in > 1% of subjects in the study included cardiac failure (7.4% overall; 6.6%, pooled OM and 8.3%, pooled placebo group), cardiac failure congestive (1.7%; 2.0% and 1.3%), renal failure acute (1.7%; 2.0% and 1.3%), and pneumonia (1.2%; 1.3% and 1.0%). Twenty su bjects (11 placebo , 9 OM) died in this study. A modest increase in the upper quartile troponin I change from baseline value was observed in OM groups compared with placebo.

Among the 10 total positively-adjudicated, post-randomization myocardial infarctions in the study (7 OM-treated subjects, 3 placebo treated subjects) , 5 occurred in OM-treated subjects in cohort 3. Of these 5 events in cohort 3, 2 occurred several days (day 12 and day 22) after drug had been discontinued (day 2) (half-life of OM is approximately 20 hours), while another occurred only after percutaneous coronary intervention. The remaining 2 subjects with myocardial infarctions had troponin elevations (peak of 0.064 and 0.168 ng/mL); the first of these was asymptomatic and the second was related to a transient episode of exertional angina, which was relieved by nitroglycerin in the setting of a history of chronic exertional angina. The remaining positively-adjudicated, post-randomization myocardial infarctions occurre d in cohort 1 subjects (3 placebo, 2 OM). The phase 2b Study 20110151 (COSMIC–HF) was designed to evaluate an oral MR formulation of OM in subjects with chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction. The study consisted of 2 parts, a dose-escalation phase and a larger and longer expansion phase , which was the first study to use a PK-based titration scheme to identify the target OM dose . The dose(s), formulation and PK-based dose adjustment scheme for the expansion phase were based on results from the dose escalation phase. The expansion phase of Study 20110151 was designed to evaluate the PK, PD, safety, and tolerability of oral OM in 448 subjects with chronic HF and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo, OM 25 mg BID, or to a PK-based dose adjustment group where 25 mg BID starting dose could be increased to 50 mg BID at W eek 8 depending on plasma concentrations of OM after 2 weeks of treatment with the 25 mg dose. Analysis of PK data showed that the PK-based dose adjustment reliably controlled subject exposure to OM . Following 20 weeks of treatment, statistically significant improvements were observed in prespecified secondary endpoint measures of cardiac function in the dose -titration group compared with p lacebo. Systolic ejection time increased by 25.0 msec (p<0.001), stroke volume increased by 3.63 mL (p=0.022), and heart rate decreased by 2.97 beats per minute (p=0.007). Left ventricular end -systolic and end -diastol ic dimensions decreased by 1.79 mm (p =0.003) and 1.29 mm (p=0.013), respectively, and were associated with statistically significant reductions in left ventricular end -systolic and end -diastolic volumes.

The incidence of adjudicated deaths (2.7% in placebo group, 1.4% in OM group), myocardial infarction (1.34% and 0.34%, respectively), and unstable angina (0% and 0.34%, respectively) was similar across groups. Other cardiac adverse events were balanced between placebo and OM groups. In the OM groups compared with placebo, cardiac troponin assessed per protocol increased by 0.001 ng/mL and 0.006 ng/mL (median change from baseline at Week 20) in the 25 mg twice daily group and dose titration group, respectively. Events of increased troponin (n = 278 across all treatment groups) were independently adjudicated and none were determined to be myocardial ischemia or infarction. 2.2.4 Dose Selection for Phase 3 The OM dosing regimen selected for this phase 3 study (20110203) is oral administration of 25 mg BID at the initiation of treatment. At study visit Week 2 (PK steady-state for initial dose), a predose PK sample will be c ollected. At Week 4, subjects with Week 2 OM predose plasma concentrations < 200 ng/mL will have their dose increas ed to 50 mg BID; subjects with Week 2 predose plasma concentrations ≥ 200 and < 300 ng/mL will have their dose increased to 37.5 mg BID, subjects with Week 2 predose plasma concentrations ≥ 300 ng/mL and < 1000 ng/mL will maintain a 25 mg BID dosing regimen, and subjects with plasma concentration ≥ 1000 ng/mL will start administration of placebo BID. Similar to Study 20110151, PK-based dose adjustment in this study will be used to attain effective steady state concentrations for desired PD effect while maintaining OM plasma concentrations < 1000 ng/mL. Please refer to Appendix D for further information on dose adjustment. Refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for additional information related to the physical, chemical, and pharmaceutical properties and formulation(s) of OM. 2.3 Rationa le OM is a promising new oral therapeutic agent for HFrEF patients targeting myocardial contractility. Current recommended pharmacological therapies for chronic HF aim at blocking/controlling the physiological compensatory mechanism. Therapeutic options to directly improve myocardial contractility for these patients are lacking. The early post -discharge period following a HF hospitalization carries particular high risk for poor clinical outcomes and is known as the “vulnerable phase” ( Greene et al, 2015 ). To help assess effects of OM during this period, the study will enroll some subjects that Approved"

The total population in this study allows assessment of OM treatment effect and safety in a more representative population of chronic HFrEF patients. 2.4 Clinical Hypotheses The primary hypothesis is that when added to SoC, OM is well tolerated and superior to placebo in reducing the risk of CV death or HF events in subjects with chronic HFrEF. Secondary hypotheses are that OM reduces the individual risks of:  CV death  HF hospitalization  all-cause death and improves symptoms in subjects with chronic HFrEF compared to placebo. 3. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN 3.1 Study Design This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, doub le-blind, parallel group, multicenter , CV outcomes study for oral OM in subjects with HFrEF, including subjects with ongoing or history of HF hospitalization. Approximately 8000 eligible s ubjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either OM or placebo. Randomization will be stratified by randomization setting (currently hospitalized for HF or recently and not currently hospitalized for HF) and region (5 strata: US and Canada ; Latin America; Western Europe, South Africa, and Australasia; Eastern Europe including Russia; Asia). Approximately 25% or more of the total planned enrollment will include subjects who are hospitalized at randomization. Enrollment of subjects in atrial fibrillation/flutter at screening is limited to approximately 25 %. The overall study design is described by a study schema at the end of the protocol synopsis section. The study endpoints are defined in Section 10.1.1 . 3.2 Number of Sites Approximately 1000 sites globally will participate in this study. Sites that do not enroll subjects within 3 months of site initiation may be closed. 3.3 Number of Subjects Participants in this clinical investigation shall be referred to as “subjects.” Approximately 8000 subjects will be randomized.

Amgen along with the study Executive Committee will estimate the date for initiating the end of study procedures based on the anticipated date of occurrence of approximately 1590 CV death events. Subject accrual is planned for 24 months. After signing the informed consent, subjects should be randomized within 8 weeks. The expected length of treatment after completion of subject accrual and until the number of required CV death events has been reached is 24 months. Therefore, it is anticipated that follow-up for the first randomized subjects will reach approximately 48 months (4 years) , and for the last randomized subjects approximately 24 months (2 years). The actual duration of study for an individual subject may be longer or shorter based up on the amount of time required to reach the specified number of events. Experiencing a nonfatal primary endpoint does not end study participation for a study subject (see criteria for withdrawal in Section 6.2.1.2 and Section 6.3). Subjects will continue treatment and follow-up procedures until the study ends as described above. All subjects will be followed from randomization through the date of study termination unless the subject has withdrawn consent, irrespective of whether the subject is continuing to receive study treatment. 3.5.2 End of Study Primary Completion : The primary completion is the date when the last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for the collection of the primary endpoint, for the purposes of conducting the primary analysis, whether the study concluded according to the p respecified protocol or was terminated. The primary completion is the same as the end of study and is the date when the last subject has completed the study. If the study concludes prior to the time point originally planned in the protocol (ie, early termination of the study), then the primary completion will be the date when the last subject is assessed or receives an intervention for evaluation in the study (ie, last subject last visit) End of Study : The end of study is the same as the primary completion date and is when the last subject has completed the end of study assessments.

SUBJECT ENROLLMENT Before subjects begin participation in any study-specific activities/procedures, Amgen requires a copy of the site’s written institutional review board/ independent ethics committee (IRB/IEC) approval of the protocol, informed consent form, and all other subject information and/or recruitment material, if applicable (see Section 11.2). All subjects must personally sign and date the informed consent form before commencement of study-specific activities/procedures. A subject is considered enrolled when the investigator decides that the subject has met all eligibility criteria. The investigator is to document this decision and date in the subject’s medical record and in/on the enrollment case report form ( CRF). Each subject who enters into the screening period for the study (defined as the point at which the subject signs the informed consent form [ ICF]) receives a unique subject identification number before any study-related activities/procedures are performed. The subject identification number will be assigned by the IVRS/IWRS. This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the clinical study and must be used on all study documentation related to that subject. Subjects who do not meet all eligibility criteria on the first screening attempt may be rescreened for the study. For each rescreening, a new ICF must be signed and the Approved"

Rescreened subjects who are reconsented will repeat all screening procedures (see Section 7.2.1 ). The subject identification number must remain constant throughout the entire clinical study; it must not be changed after initial assignment, including if a subject is rescreened . This number will not necessarily be the same as the randomization number assigned for the study. 5.1 Randomization/Treatment Assignment Subjects who me et the eligibility requirements will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 treatment groups ( OM or placebo) in a double-blind manner. Randomization will be stratified by randomization setting (currently hospitalized for HF or recently and not currently hospitalized for HF) and region (5 strata: US and Canada; Latin America; Western Europe, South Africa, and Australasia; Eastern Europe including Russia; Asia) . Subjects can only be randomized 1 time for this study. Subjects in the recently and not currently hospitalized for HF setting who meet all eligibility criteria at the end of screening will return to the study site for randomization and day 1 procedures . Subjects in the currently hospitalized for HF setting who meet all eligibility criteri a at the end of screening should be randomized prior to discharge with day 1 procedures occurring during the hospitalization. The randomization date is to be documented in the subject’s medical record and on the enrollment CRF. Randomization numbers will be provided to the site through an IVRS/IWRS. 5.2 Site Personnel Access to Individual Treatment Assignments A subject’s treatment assignment should only be unblinded when knowledge of the treatment is essential for the further management of the subject on this study . Unblinding at the study site for any other reason will be considered a protocol deviation. The investigator is strongly encouraged to contact the Amgen Clinical Study Manager before unblinding any subject’s treatment assignment, but must do so wit hin 1 working day after the event. Refer to the Investigational Product Instruction Manual (IPIM) for a description regarding how responsible pharmacists and investigators will access treatment information via the IVR/IWR system, in the event that there is a need to break the blind.

TREATMENT PROCEDURES 6.1 Classification of Product The Amgen IPs used in this study include : OM and matching placebo. The IPIM, a document external to this protocol, contains detailed information regarding the storage, preparation, destruction, and administration of OM and placebo . 6.2 Investigational Product 6.2.1 Amgen I nvestigational Product (OM ) OM will be manufactured and packaged by Amgen Inc. or designee and distributed using Amgen clinical study drug distribution procedures. OM will be presented as tablets. Tablets will be packaged in 14-count blisters . Further details regarding IP storage condition, dispensation, packaging, labeling, and accounting procedures are outlined in the IPIM. Placebo will be presented in identical c ontainers and stored/packaged the same as OM. 6.2.1.1 Dosage, Administration, and Schedule IP will be administered orally BID in the morning and evening by the subjects and can be taken under fasted or fed conditions. IP will be swallowed whole (not chewed, crush ed, or split ) and taken with water as instructed in the IPIM. Each morning and evening administration should be taken at approximately the same time of day. If IP cannot be taken or has not been taken within approximately 12 ± 3 hours from the most recen t previous dose, the dose should be missed and the next dose should be taken at the regular time. The amount dispensed, amount returned, date dispensed, date returned, and box number of Amgen IP are to be recor ded on each subject’s CRF . Subjects randomize d to OM will initiate administration at 25 mg BID. At study visit Week 2, a predose blood sample will be collected for all subjects. The results will be blinded to investigators. For subjects randomized to OM, predose PK collected at Week 2 will guide the dose adjustment. A new IP supply will be provided to a subject when PK is assessed for the purpose of dose adjustment regardless of randomized treatment group and outcome of the PK assessment in order to maintain the blind. Subjects randomized to placebo will receive placebo throughout the study and will be submitted to all protocol procedures in order to maintain the blindness of treatment group allocation and IP dose. Subjects should continue to take IP through the morning of the end of study (EOS) Visit. Approved"

Excessive exposure to OM may result i n signs and symptoms of myocardial ischemia or infarction (eg, increases in heart rate, dizziness, dyspnea, hypotension, chest discomfort or pain, ST-segment depression/elevation on ECG, and/or elevations in troponin I or T). No antidote to OM currently exists. In the event of an overdose, health care pr oviders should be especially vigilant for signs and symptom of myocardial ischemia. Standard medical therapies should be used to treat adverse signs or symptoms that do not promptly resolve with discontinuation of the IP. 6.2.1.2 Dosage Adjustments, Delays , Rules for Withholding or Restarting , Permanent Discontinuation All subjects will have predose PK assessed at W eek 2 in order to guide the dose adjustment for subjects randomized to OM. At W eek 6, another pred ose PK will be assessed to reflect the PK results of the previous adjustment. Pharmacokinetics will be assessed on W eeks 12 and 48, and then every 48 weeks throughout the study. See Appendix D for a summary of dose adjustment rules. A new investigational product supply will be provided to all subjects at the Week 4 and Week 8 study visits regardless of randomized treatment group and outcome of the PK assessment in order to maintain the blind. If the Week 2 PK value is not available in time for dose adjustment, subjects randomized to OM will continue with the 25 mg BID dose assignment pending the Week 6 PK assessment. If the W eek 6 PK value is not available in time for the dose adjustment, subjects randomized to OM will be assigned to the lower dosage regimen (25 mg BID). At W eeks 12, 48, and then every 48 weeks, PK will be assessed and are not part of the PK-based dose adjustment approach (Note: subjects in between visits week 12 and week 24 at the time of local approval of this global amendment number 1 should have a PK assessment conducted during the week 24 visit). Subjects with plasma concentration ≥ 1000 ng/mL at assessments after the Week 8 visi t will be requested to stop IP administration, regardless of signs or symptoms. An extra visit will be scheduled and the subject’s treatment assignment will be unblinded. Subjects randomized to placebo will receive placebo throughout the study but will undergo identical PK and resupply procedures. Approved"

If a subject experiences clinical signs or symptoms consistent with acute myocardial ischemia or infarction, the subject should receive immediate medical attention according to the institution’s usual SoC, and the IP admini stration should be withheld. Serial cardiac ischemic markers and ECGs should be analyzed locally. Results from local laboratory assessment of Troponins (I or T), CK-MB , and BNP or NT-proBNP should be recorded in the CRF. A central laboratory PK sample, Troponin I, CK-MB , and NT-proBNP should be collected in all subjects experiencing such events as close as possible to the event and the time last IP was taken . The results of the PK assessment, when present, will routinely remain blinded to the sponsor and investigators. The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), however, will receive unblinded PK data . Amgen should be notified of suspected acute myocardial ischemia or infarction within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. Restarting IP after a cardiac ischemic event may be considered after appropriate management of the case, and assessment of the likely cause of the event and the potential relatedness of the event to IP. The decision to reinitiate the subject after a cardiac ischemic event should be discussed and agreed upon unanimously by the subject, investigator, and Amgen . Subjects experiencing acute cardiac ischemic events suspected to be related to IP should not be rechallenged. When restarting, subjects initiate OM 25 mg BID or placebo BID, according t o initial group allocation. A new predose PK assessment will be conducted after 2 weeks from IP reinitiation, and dose adjustment will occur at the next IP dispensation visit. The adjustment follows the same procedures as for study visit W eek 4, limiting the maximum dose to what was assigned before the event. Subjects reinitiating IP after withholding for reasons other than cardiac ischemic events will restart on the same IP dose as established before the event. 6.2.1.3 Other Protocol-required Therapies At randomization, recently and not currently hospitalized for HF or currently hospitalized for HF subjects should be optimally managed consistent with HF SoC therapies defined by regional clinical practice guidelines. Oral SoC therapies for chronic HF (eg, beta blockers, renin-angiotensin -aldosterone system inhibitors) should be present, if not contraindicated.

Medical history will include information on the subject’s concurrent medical conditions. Record all findings on the medical history CRF. 7.2.6.4 Vital Signs The following measurements must be performed: systolic/diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. Use of an automated oscillometric device for blood pressure measurement i s preferred and recommended. Blood pressure will be recorded in both of the subject’s arms unless a concomitant condition favors the use of a particular arm. The arm with the higher systolic reading will be used for eligibility determination. The appropriate size cuff should be used. The subject’s pulse should be measured for 30 seconds and the number multiplied by 2 to obtain heart rate. Blood pressure measurement can be repeated if the previous reading is outside of the eligibility range. The repeat blood pressure measure should be taken at least 2 minutes following the previous measure. Subjects must be in supine position in a rested and calm state for at least 5 minutes before blood pressure assessments are conducted. If the subject is unable to be in the supine position, the subject should be in the most recumbent position possible. The position selected for a subject should be the same that is used throughout the study and documented on the vital sign CRF. Record all measurements on the vital signs CRF. Approved"

Biomarker development can be useful in developing markers to identify disease subtypes, guide therapy, and/or predict disease severity. Amgen may attempt to develop test(s) designed to identify subjects most likely to respond positively or negatively to OM. Blood Samples Blood samples are to be collected for biomarker development at the following time points: day 1, Week 6, Week 24, and EOS visit. 7.4 Pharmacogenetic Studies If the subject consents to the optional pharmacogenetic portion of this study, DNA analyses may be performed. These optional pharmacogenetic analyses focus on inherited genetic variations to evaluate their possible correlation to the disease and/or responsiveness to the therapies used in this study. The goals of the optio nal studies include the use of genetic markers to help in the investigation of OM and/or to identify subjects who may have positive or negative response to OM. No additional samples are collected for this part of the study.

Samples will be tracked using a unique id entifier that is assigned to the samples for the study. Results are stored in a secure database to ensure confidentiality. If informed consent is provided by the subject, Amgen can do additional testing on remaining samples (ie, residual and back-up) to investigate and better understand HF, the dose response and/or prediction of response to OM, and characterize aspects of the molecule (eg, mechanism of action/target, metabolites). Results from this analysis are to be documented and maintained, but are n ot necessarily reported as part of this study. Samples can be retained for up to 20 years. Since the evaluations are not expected to benefit the subject directly or to alter the treatment course, the results of pharmacogenetic , biomarker development, or other exploratory studies are not placed in the subject’s medical record and are not to be made available to the subject, members of the family, the personal physician, or other third parties , except as specified in the informed consent. The subject retains the right to request that the sample material be destroyed by contacting the investigator. Following the request from the subject, the investigator is to provide the sponsor with the required study and subject number so that any remaining blood samples and any other components from the cells can be located and destroyed. Samples will be destroyed once all protocol-defined procedures are completed. However, information collected from samples prior to the request for destruction, will be retained by Amg en.

WITHDRAWAL FROM TREATMENT, PROCEDURES, AND STUDY 8.1 Subjects’ Decision to Withdraw Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason without prejudice to their future medical care by the physician or at the institutio n. Subjects (or a legally acceptable representative) can decline to continue receiving IP and/or other protocol-required therapies or procedures at any time during the study but continue participation in the study . If this occurs, the investigator is to discuss with the subject the appropriate processes for discontinuation from IP or other protocol-required therapies and must discuss with the subject t he options for continuation of the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 ) including different options of follow -up (eg, in person, by phone/mail , through family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other treatment physicians, from the review of medical records) and collection of data, including endpoints and advers e events. Subjects who have discontinued investigational product and/or protocol required therapies or procedures should not be automatically removed from the study. Whenever safe and feasible it is imperative that subjects remain on-study to ensure safety surveillance and/or collection of outcome data. The investigator must document the change to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2 ) and the level of follow-up that is agreed to by the subject ( eg, in person, by telephone/mail, through family/friends, in correspondence/communication with other physicians, from review of the medical records ). Withdrawal of consent for follow-up should be accompanied by documentation of the reason for withdrawal. Withdrawal of consent for treatment should be distinguished from withdrawal of consent for follow-up visits and from withdrawal of consent for non-patient contact follow-up (eg, medical records checks). Subjects requesting withdrawal should be informed that withdrawal of consent for follow-up will jeopardize the public health value of the study. Subjects who withdraw should be asked explicitly about the contribution of possible adverse events to their decision to withdraw consent, and any adverse event information elicited should be documented. Preferably the subject should withdraw consent in writing and, if the subject or the subject’s representative refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document Approved"

SAFETY DATA COLLECTION, RECORDING, AND REPORTING 9.1 Definition of Safety Events 9.1.1 Disease Related Events Events that are not submitted for adjudication as potential endpoints, but that are anticipated to occur in the study population due to the underlying disease, may be reported a s Disease Related Events . In this study, subjects will have HFrEF with an LVEF of ≤ 35%. It is expected that the study subjects will experience events related to chronic HFr EF. Examples of events related to HF include:  fluid overload signs and symptoms (eg, edema, pulmonary congestion, dyspnea , orthopnea, hepatic congestion) not requiring urgent, unscheduled clinic/office/ED visit, or hospital admission  renal function impairment (eg, cardiorenal syndrome, acute renal failure) not requiring urgent, unscheduled clinic/office/ED visit, or hospital admission If the event is considered wors e than that which would normally be expected for the subject, or if the investigator believes there is a causal relationship between the IP and disease worsening, the event should not be considered a Disease Related Event and must be reported as an Adverse Event or Serious Adverse Event. If a Disease Related Event is considered as an adverse event and is serious, the event should be reported within 24 hours of the acknowledgement of the event. 9.1.2 Adverse Events An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical trial subject. The event does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study treatment. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that any adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject are recorded in the subject’s medical record. The definition of adverse events includes worsening of a pre-existing medical condition. Worsening indicates that the pre -existing medical condition or underlying disease (eg, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) has increased in severity, frequency, and/or duration more than would be expected , and/or has an association with a significantly worse outcome than expected. A pre-existing condition that has not worsened more than anticipated (ie, more than usual fluctua tion of disease) during the study or involves an intervention such as elective cosmetic surgery or a medical procedure while on study , is not considered an adverse event. Only adverse events considered related to study procedures and serious adverse events are reported after signing of the informed consent until randomization. Approved"
53,page_53,"Product: Omecamtiv Mecarbil (AMG 423) Protocol Number: 20110203 Date: 13 November 2018 Page 54 of 85 CONFIDENTIAL If the severity of an adverse event changes from the date of onset to the date of resolution, record as a single event with the worst severity on the Event CRF. The investigator’s clinical judgment is used to determine whether a subject is to be removed from treatment due to an adverse event. In the event a subject, or subject’s legally acceptable representative requests to withdraw from protocol-required therapies or the study due to an adverse event , refer to Section 8.1 for additional instructions on the procedures recommended for safe withdrawal from protocol -required therapies or the study. 9.1.3 Serious Adverse Events A serious adverse event is defined as an adverse event that meets at least 1 of the following serious criteria (unless it meets the definition of a Disease Related Event as defined in Section 9.1.1 ):  fatal  life threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death)  requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  congenital anomaly/birth defect  other medically important serious event A disease related event, as described above, is to be reported as a serious adverse event if  the subject’s pre-existing condition becomes worse than what the investigator would consider typical for a patient with the same underlying condition, or  if the investigator believes a causal relationship exists between the investigational medicinal product(s)/protocol-required therapies and the event ,  and the event meets at least 1 of the serious criteria above. An adverse event would meet the criterion of “requires hospitalization,” if the event necessitated an admission to a health care facility (eg, overnight stay). If an investigator considers an event to be clinically important, but it does not meet any of the serious criteria, the event could be classified as a serious adverse event under the criterion of “other medically important serious event.” Examples of such events could include allergic bronchospasm, convulsions, blood dyscrasias, DILI (see Appendix A for DILI reporting criteria), or events that necessitate an emergency room visit , outpatient surgery, or urgent intervention.

Events assessed by the investigator to be related to the investigational medicinal product(s ) or considered worse than that which would normally be expected for the subject and determined to be serious, require reporting of the event on the Event CRF as a Serious Adverse Event rather than as a Disease Related Event, and within 24 hours from the acknowledgement of the event. 9.2.2 Adverse Events 9.2.2.1 Reporting Procedures for Adverse Events That do not Meet Serious Criteria The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after randomization through end of study/safety follow-up visit, or 30 days after the last administration of IP, whichever is later, are reported using the Event CRF. The investigator must assign the following adverse event attributes:  Adverse event diagnosis or syndrome(s), if known (if not known, signs or symptoms),  Dates of onset and resolution (if resolved),  Severity (and/or toxicity per protocol),  Assessment of relatedness to OM, and  Action taken. The adverse event grading scale used will be the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE ). Because the criteria for the CTCAE grading scale differs from the regulatory criteria for serious adverse events, if adverse events correspond to grade 4 “life-threatening” CTCAE grading scale criteria (eg, laboratory abnormality reported as grade 4 without manifestation of life-threatening status), it will be left to the investigator’s judgment to also report these abnormalities as serious adverse events. For any adverse event that applies to this situation, comprehensive documentation of the event’s severity status must be recorded in the subject’s medical record. The grading Approved"

The investigator must assess whether the adverse event is possibly related to the OM. This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the IP ? The investigator is responsible for reviewing laboratory test results and determining whether an abnormal value in an individual study subject represents a clinically significant change from the subject’s baseline values. In general, abnormal laboratory findings without clinical significance (based on the investigator's judgment) are not to be recorded as adverse events. However, laboratory value changes that require treatment or adjustment in current therapy are considered adverse events. Where applicable, clinical sequelae (not the laboratory abnormality) are to be recorded as the adverse event. The i nvestigator is expected to follow reported adverse events until stabilization or reversibility. 9.2.2.2 Reporting Procedures for Serious Adverse Events The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all serious adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the subject that occur after informed consent through end of study/safety follow-up visit, or 30 days after the last administration of IP, whichever is later, are recorded in the subject’s medical record and are submitted to Amgen . All serious adverse events must be submitted to Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event via the Event CRF. There is no requirement to monitor study subjects for s erious adverse events following the protocol -required reporting period or after end of study. However, these serious adverse events can be reported to Amgen. In some countries (eg, European Union [EU] member states), investigators are required to report serious adverse events that they become aware of after end of study. If serious adverse events are reported, the investigator is to report them to Amgen within 24 hours following the investigator’s knowledge of the event. Serious adverse events reported outside of the protocol-required reporting period will be captured within the safety database as clinical trial cases for the purposes of expedited reporting. If the electronic data capture (EDC) system is unavailable to the site staff to report the serious adverse event , the information is to be reported to Amgen via an electronic Approved"

See Appendix B for a sample of the Serious Adverse Event Worksheet /electronic Serious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form . For EDC studies where the first notification of a Serious Adverse Event is reported to Amgen via the eSerious Adverse Event Contingency Report Form, the data must be entered into the EDC system when the system is again available. The investigator must assess whether the serious adverse event is possibly related to any study-mandated activity or procedure. This relationship is indicated by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by a study activity/procedure”? The investigator is expected to follow reported serious adverse events until stabilization or reversibility. New information relating to a previously reported serious adverse event must be submitted to Amgen . All new information for serious adverse events must be sent to Amgen within 24 hours following knowledge of the new information. The investigator may be asked to provide additional follow-up information, which may include a discharge summary or extracts from the medical record. Information provided about the serious adverse event must be consistent with that recorded on the Event CRF. If a subject is permanently withdrawn from protocol-required therapies because of a serious adverse event, this information must be submitted to Amgen. To comply with worldwide reporting regulations for serious adverse events, the treatment assignment of subjects who develop serious, unexpected, and related adverse events may be unblinded by Amgen before submission to regulatory authorities. Investigator s will receive notification of related serious adverse events reports sent to regulatory authorities in accordance with local requirements. Amgen will report serious adverse events and/or suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions as required to regulatory authorities, investigators/institutions, and IRBs/IECs in compliance with all reporting requirements according to local regulations and good clinical practice .

Unless otherwise specified, for safety analyses, subjects will be grouped according to their randomized treatment group assignment with the following exc eption: if a subject receives treatment throughout the study that is different than the randomized treatment group assignment, then the subject will be grouped by the actual treatment group. 10.1.3 Covariates and Subgroups Baseline covariates include, but are not limited to eGFR and the stratification factor of randomization setting and region. Prespecified subgroups for the analysis include, but are not limited to:  stratification factor of randomization setting (currently hospitalized for HF or recently and not currently hospitalized for HF)  stratification factor of region (5 strata: US and Canada ; Latin America ; Western Europe, South Africa, and Australasia; Eastern Europe including Russia; Asia)  age (< 65 years, ≥ 65 years)  sex (male, female)  baseline weight (quartiles)  race (black or African American, white, Asian, other)  ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, not Hispanic or Latino)  baseline NYHA Class (II, III/IV)  diabetes mellitus at baseline (yes, no)  primary cause of HF (ischemic, nonischemic)  medical history of myocardial infarction (yes, no)  presence of atrial fibrillation/flutter at screening (yes, no)  baseline LVEF (≤ median, > median)  baseline NT-proBNP by randomization setting excluding subjects in atrial fibrillation/flutter at screening (≤ median and > median)  baseline resting heart rate (≤ median and > median)  baseline systolic blood pressure (≤ median and > me dian)  baseline eGFR (≤ 60 mL/min/1.73m2, > 60 mL/min/1.73m2)  baseline use of ACEi  baseline use of ARB  baseline use of aldosterone inhibitor  baseline use of ARNi Approved"

The control group event rate is assumed to vary by randomization setting. Subjects randomized in a hospital setting are assumed to have greater risk in the first year of 19% followed by the constant yearly outpatient setting rate of 7%. Assuming 25% of subjects will be randomized in the hospital setting, the CV death rate in the first year is expected to be 10% overall subjects and 7% for each year thereafter. A 24 month enrollment period is assumed and the total study duration set to 48 months. The ha zard ratio for CV death alone is assumed to be 0.8 after a 3 month treatment lag at the beginning of the trial, where the hazard ratio is assumed to be 1. Additionally, assume 10% of subjects discontinue therapy per year and 10% of subjects over the course of the trial will be lost to endpoint determination. The overall type I error is 0.05 for 2-sided testing. After accounting for these factors, a total sample size of approximately 8000 subjects with approximately 1590 subjects experiencing CV death events is required to ensure a power of 90% for testing superiority for CV death (Shih, 1995). Assuming the rates for experiencing either a HF event or CV death are double those for CV death alone and the same other assumptions as for CV death alone, the primary composite endpoint is expected to have greater than 99% power when the primary analysis is triggered. 10.3 Access to Individual Subject Treatment Assignments by Amgen or Designees Blinded individuals will not have access to unblinded information until the study is formally unblinded. Unblind ing and potentially unblinding information should not be distributed to the study team, investigators or subjects prior to the study being formally unblinded except as specified (eg, Section 5.2 and Section 9.2.2.2 ). 10.4 Planned Analyses 10.4.1 Interim Analyses Futility for the primary endpoint will be assessed when approximately one-third and two-thirds of the overall required CV deaths are observed. Efficacy will be assessed when approximately two-thirds of the overall required CV deaths are observed. An alpha of 0.001 (Haybittl e-Peto approach; Haybittle, 1971 ; Peto et al, 1976) will be used for assessing superiority. The DMC can recommend stopping the trial if the primary Approved"

The remainder of the secondary endpoints will be assessed with an overall alpha of 0.001 following the testing diagram if the study is stopped early. Interim futility and efficacy assessments will be conducted by the Independent Biostatistical Group (IBG) and reviewed by the DMC. Blinded event rate monitoring during the study will be conducted periodically to assess the study planning assumptions versus the trial aggregate data. This monitoring will be conducted by the sponsor’s clinical study team. Appropriate operational actions may be implemented due to results from this monitoring. 10.4.2 Data Monitoring Committee An external independent DMC will be established to formally review the accumulating data from this study to ensure there is no avoidable increased risk for harm to subjects and conduct the interim analyses for futility and efficacy. The independent DMC is chaired by an external academic cardiologist who is an expert in HF and clinical trials. Analyses for the DMC will be provided by the IBG, which is external to Amgen. Details will be provided in the DMC charter. The independent DMC members and the IBG will have access to treatment assignments and subject level data from the clinical trial database. 10.4.3 Primary Analysis The primary analysis will include hypothesis testing for each of the primary and secondary endpoints and include analyses of exploratory endpoints. The primary analysis will occur after the primary completion milestone of observing approximately 1590 CV deaths is achieved. At that point , the database will be cleaned, processed and a snapshot will be taken . The study will also be unblinded. Based on the snapshot, unless specified otherwise, efficacy analyses will be performed on the FAS by randomized treatment group and safety analyses will be performed on the SAS. 10.5 Planned Methods of Analysis 10.5.1 General Considerations Unless otherwise specified, all hypothesis tests will be reported as 2-sided and the full study will have an overall type I error rate of 0.05. Missing data will not be imputed i n the primary analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints. Subject disposition, demographics, baseline characteristics, and exposure to IP will be summarized.

Categorical variables will be summarized using the number and percent of subjects. All deaths, HF events, major cardiac ischemic adverse events (myocardial infarction, unstable angina hospitalization, and coronary revascularization), and strokes will be adjudicated by an independent external CEC, using standardized definitions. The CEC is external to Amgen and primarily comprises both academic clinical physicians (to include cardiologists) and medical reviewers trained on the clinical trial protocol, the CEC charter, and CEC processes. The chairman of the CEC is responsible for overseeing the operations in conformance with the CEC charter and for supervising the flow of data between the sponsor/data management and the CEC. Committee members are qualified in the appropriate subspecialty and free of conflict of interest. The CEC is blinded to treatment allocation and reviews events according to prespecified criteria defined in the CEC charter. 10.5.2 Multiplicity Adjustments In order to preserve an overall type I error rate of 0.05 for the primary and secondary endpoints, the following multiplicity adjustment will be performed: A total alpha of 0.001 (one-sided 0.0005) will be used for assessing superiority at the second interim analysis. If the study continues, a total alpha of 0.05 will be used for testing at the primary analysis triggered based on observing approximately 1590 CV deaths. Within an analysis, the total alpha will apply to all primary and secondary endpoint hypothesis tests. The primary endpoint will be tested first with the total alpha. If the primary endpoint reaches statistical significance, a Bonferroni split w ill be used where 0.96α is allocated to testing the time to CV death and 0.04α is allocated to testing change baseline in the KCCQ TSS. Alpha from a statistically significant result for these 2 endpoints after the split will propagate to the other endpoint ( Bretz et al, 2009 ) with a small alpha (0.0001 x fraction of the α used in the statistically significant test ) propagating to testing time to first heart failure hospitalization. If statistical significance is achieved for both the time to CV death and change from baseline in the KCCQ TSS, time to first heart failure hospitalization will be tested at the full alpha. If time to first heart failure hospitalization is statistically significant, time to all-cause death will be tested with the same alpha as time to first heart failure hospitalization. Figure 2 illustrates the multiplicity testing propagation approach. Alpha will only propagate if the Approved"

Dashed arrows used to emphasize this prioritization. No multiplicity adjustment will be made for exploratory or sensitivity analyses. 10.5.3 Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary endpoint is the composite of time to CV death or fi rst HF event, whichever occurs first. The composite endpoint will be assessed using a Cox model stratified by randomization setting and regio n. The Cox model will include terms for baseline eGFR and the treatment group. The treatment effect will be tested u sing a likelihood ratio test and 95% confidence intervals for the model parameters will be c omputed. Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative i ncidence of the composite endpoint will be computed. The Cox model will be fit for subgroups of the stratification f actors and the other prespecified subgroups. 10.5.4 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The secondary endpoints of time t o CV death, time to first HF hospitalization, and time to all-cause death will be assesse d using a Cox model stratified b y randomization setting and region and include terms f or baseline eGFR and treatment.
