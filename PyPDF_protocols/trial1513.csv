PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS The protocol synopsis has been updated to reflect the changes made to the protocol, where applicable. SECTION: Target Population Reason for change :Text has been added to provide guidance on conditions allowing for the re- screening of patients. Added text: Re-screening may be considered for patients who do not show sufficient disease deterioration in accordance to the protocol at the time of the initial screening. Re - screening is permitted if there is strong evidence of clinical worsening based on the Investigator’ s judgement and only upon receipt of official approval from the Study Management Team. In such cases, re -screening may be performed after a minimum of 4-weeks lapse from the initial screening date. PROTOCOL SECTION 4.1: Patients Reason for change: Text has been added to provide guidance and conditions allowing for the re-scr eening of patients. Added text : Re-screening may be considered for patients who do not show sufficient disease deterioration in accordance to the protocol at the time of the initial screening. Re - screening is permitted if there is strong evidence of cli nical worsening based on the Investigator’ s judgement and only upon receipt of official approval from the Study Management Team.

Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 4/Protocol MA39189 ,Version 3.0SECTION 4.5.5 : FVC Reason for change: Text has been added in order to provide additional guidance on the use of short -acting bronchodilator prior to spirometry. Added text : If a patient is routinely treated with a short -acting bronchodilator (for example albuterol, salbutamol), the bronchodilator should be taken approximately 30 minutes prior to the on -site spirometry. SECTION 4.5.9 : Electrocardiograms Reason for change: Text amended in order to replace a general guidance with specific requirements provided in section 5.1.1.8. Amended text : For safety monitoring purposes, the investigator must review, sign, and date all ECG tracings. Paper copies of ECG tracings will be kept as part of the patient's permanent trial file at the site. Digital recordings will be s tored at site. The following should be recorded in the appropriate eCRF: heart rate, RR interval, QRS interval, PR duration, uncorrected QT interval, and the QTcF based on the machine readings of the individual ECG tracings. Any morphologic waveform change s or other ECG abnormalities must be documented on the eCRF. If considered appropriate by the Sponsor, ECGs may be analyzed retrospectively at a central laboratory. Refer to section 5.1.1.8 for details on protocol management of increases in QT interval. Ifat a particular post dose time point the mean QTcF is 500 ms and/or 60 ms longer than the baseline value, another ECG must be recorded, ideally within the next 5minutes, and ECG monitoring should continue until QTcF has stabilized on two successive ECG s. The Medical Monitor should be notified. Standard of care treatment may be instituted at the discretion of the investigator. A decision on trial treatment discontinuation should be made, as described in Section 4.6.1 . The investigator should also evaluat e the patient for potential concurrent risk factors (e.g., electrolyte abnormalities, co medications known to prolong the QT interval, and severe bradycardia).

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd Objectives and Endpoints This trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in patients with fibrosing interstitial lung disease (ILD) who cannot be classified with moderate or high confidence into any other category of fibrosing ILD by multidisciplinary team (MDT) review (“unclassifiable” ILD). Efficacy Objective The primary efficacy objective for this trial is to evaluate the effect of pirfenidone vs. placebo on lung function parameters on the basis of the following endpoint: Rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) measured in mL by daily handheld spirometer over the 24- week double -blind treatment period. Safety Objective The safety objective for this trial is to evaluate the safety of pirfenidone vs. placebo on the basis of the following endpoints: Nature, f requency, severity, and timing of treatment -emergent adverse events Dose reductions and treatment interruptions Clinical laboratory test results 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) Withdrawals from trial treatment or trial discontinuations. Exploratory Obje ctive One exploratory objective for this trial is to evaluate the role of MMF (mycophenolate mofetil/sodium or mycophenolic acid) treatment in ILD on the basis of the following endpoint: Efficacy and safety data from subgroups of patients who did or did no t receive MMF treatment."
17,page_17,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 17/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0In addition, exploratory biomarkers associated with fibrosis and ILD will be evaluated in plasma, serum, and whole blood ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples. Trial Design Description of Trial This is a multicenter, international, double -blind, two -arm, randomized, placebo - controlled Phase II trial in patients with fibrosing ILD who cannot be classified with moderate or high confidence into any other category of fibrosing ILD by MDT review (“unclassifiabl e ILD”). Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, on a double -blind basis using a stratified algorithm, to receive either pirfenidone (801 mg three times daily [TID]) or placebo. The randomized patients will be stratified by concomitant MMF treatment (yes/no), the presence/absence of interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF) as defined by the MDT. Most established MDTs have access to clinical, radiologic, and pathology expertise, and should have a sufficient case load of ILDs per year. Acces s to rheumatology expertise will be at the discretion of the MDT. In total, approximately 90 clinical centers (sites) in Australia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America are expected to enroll approximately 250 patients. Patients who are withdrawn fro m the trial will not be replaced. The trial design is represented in Figure 1. After discussing the risks and benefits of the trial with the investigator and providing informed consent, patients will be required to taper and/or discontinue all prohibited medications (Section 4.4.2 ) in the 28 days prior to the start of screening during the washout period. If a prohibited medication must be tapered, the process must start early enough so that the patient discontinues the medication in the 28 days prior to the start of screening. After completing the washout period, patients will enter screening, which lasts up to 21 days. During screening, patients will be evaluated for eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients not taking a prohibited medication will forgo the washout period and directly enter screening. At the end of screening, patients will be randomized (Day 1) to receive either pirfenidone or place bo (1:1 ratio). Following treatment initiation, the daily dosage will be titrated to the full dosage of nine capsules per day over a 14 -day period as outlined in Table 2. After the titration period, trial treatment will continue through Week 24 and monito ring will be conducted by trial visits. Patients should remain on a stable maintenance dose for the duration of the treatment period unless the dose is reduced or dosing is interrupted to manage an adverse event (see Section 5.1.1 ). Any patient with an actual or anticipated interruption of trial treatment for a period of ≥28 consecutive days will be reported by telephone to Roche‘s medical monitor or designee to discuss the circum stances of the case.

Statistical Methods Primary Analysis The primary efficacy objective for this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of pirfenidone vs. placebo on lung function parameters on the basis of rate of decline in FVC in mL"
22,page_22,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 22/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0measured by handheld spirometry over the 24 -week double -blind treatment period (see Section 2). The primary analysi s will be based on the intent -to-treat (ITT) population. Patients who discontinue treatment prematurely will be analyzed based on the available data. No imputation method will be applied. The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will compare the mean F VC decline in each treatment arm using a student’s t -test with a two- sided significance level α=0.05. The mean FVC decline for each treatment arm will be calculated using the estimated FVC decline for each individual patient. The individual FVC decline wil l be estimated by applying a linear regression model to all data points collected during the 24 -week double -blind treatment period. Determination of Sample Size The purpose of this trial is hypothesis generation regarding the efficacy of pirfenidone vs. p lacebo on lung function parameters on the basis of rate of decline in FVC, as measured by daily handheld spirometry. A total sample size of approximately 250 patients is planned, and patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The randomization will be str atified by concomitant MMF treatment (yes/no), the presence/absence of IPAF as defined by the MDT. The planned sample size is based on the statistical hypothesis of the primary endpoint and assumes 80% power and a two -sided significance level of 5% using a student’s t - test. It is assumed, after inspection of historical data, that FVC decline in the placebo arm is 85 mL with a common standard deviation of 70 mL, which can be reduced to 60mL with a common standard deviation of 70 mL in the pirfenidone arm. I n this scenario, 125 patients per treatment arm are needed to detect this treatment effect with 80% power. Interim A nalyses There are no planned interim efficacy analyses for this trial. Safety interim analyses will be performed at least three times during the trial, at approximately 6, 12, and 18 months after the start of recruitment."

BACKGROUND 1.1 BACKGROUND ON UNCLA SSIFIABLE INTERSTITIA L LUNG DISEA SE The proper classification of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) requires multidisciplinary expertise with input from various clinical experts, including pulmonologists, thoracic radiologists, and lung pathologists (Ryerson et al. 2013 ). Despite this coordinated effort, approximately 15% of all patients evaluated by multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) cannot ultimately be classified according to their fibrosing ILD (Skolnik and Ryerson 2016) . Classification cannot be achieved in these patients due to nonspecific or conflicting clinical, radiological, or histopathological findings, or because patients are unable or unwilling to undergo certain, in particular invasive, diagnostic procedures (Cottin and Wells 2013 ; Ryerson et al. 2013). Unclassi ﬁable ILD represents a heterogeneous collection of undiagnosed ﬁbrosing ILDs, which have a prognosis between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and other non- IPF fibrosing ILDs (Ryerson et al. 2013) . Patients also display clinical features typical of both IPF, dominated by fibrotic changes to lung architecture, and other non -IPF ILDs (i.e., chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis [cHP], idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia [NSIP], connective tissue disease -ILD [CTD -ILD]), in which inflammatory processes predominate. The fibrotic features of IPF include the patchy involvement of lung parenchyma by fibrosis/architect ural distortion, honeycombing in a predominantly subpleural/paraseptal distribution, and the presence of fibroblast foci (Spagnolo et al. 2012 ). Owing to the heterogeneous nature of the disease, the choice of pharmacotherapy for unclassifiable ILD is unquestionably complex (Skolnik and Ryerson 2016 ). Treatment usage is complicated by both a lack of direct evidence in this patient population and by clinical data that indicate that different therapeutic s trategies need to be employed in patients with IPF compared with patients with other fibrotic ILDs (Raghu et al. 2012 ; Skolnik and Ryerson 2016) . Therefore it is not currently possible to use one specific therapy in all patients with unclassi ﬁable ILD and each patient must be treated on a case -by-case basis (Skolnik and Ryerson 2016 ). Although no specific therapy has been universally recommended to treat patients with unclassi ﬁable ILD, immunomodulatory treatments such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) have been used by several authors to treat the diverse spectrum of ILD (Fischer et al. 2013 ; Panopoulos et al. 2013 ; Tzouvelekis et al. 2012). 1.2 BACKGROUND ON PIRFEN IDONE Pirfenidone is an orally active, small molecule (molecular weight: 185.2 g/mol) that has been shown to exert both antifibrotic and anti -inflammatory properties in a variety of animal models and in vitro systems. The broad antifibrotic activity of pirfenidone across organ systems has been demonstrated in more than 20 animal studies utilizing various models that examined liver, heart, kidney, and lung fibrosis (Schaefer et al. 2011 ). Studies involving bleomycin -induced pulmonary fibrosis models found that pirfenidone"
27,page_27,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 27/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0reduced visible lung pathology, lung tissue hydroxyproline content, edema (wet -to-dry lung weight), as well as the histological fibrotic score (Oku et al. 2008 ; Takeda et al. 2014 ). Additionally, pirfenidone administration significantly suppressed bleomycin - induced increases in interleukin -(IL)-1β, IL- 6, monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1, an d IL-12p40 in these models (Oku et al. 2008 ). In cell -based systems, pirfenidone suppressed the proliferation of fibroblasts; attenuated the production of profibrotic cytokines, including platelet -derived growth factor (PDGF) and tra nsforming growth factor -beta (TGF -β); promoted the release of collagenase from fibroblasts; and reduced the accumulation of certain extracellular matrix components, in particular collagen (EMA 2010 ). Taken together, the preclinical c ell-based studies and the investigations involving animal fibrosis models provide evidence that pirfenidone reduces levels of profibrotic growth factors and cytokines, lessens collagen deposition, and reduces interstitial fibrosis. All of these factors are known to be physiological elements which are to dysregulated in IPF (Clarke et al. 2013 ; Ryu et al. 2014 ; Todd et al. 2012). Following on from the promising findings obtained in the extensive pre -clinical program, several clinical trials were conducted to investigate the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in patients with IPF. A proof -of-concept study in 107 patients with IPF found that treatment with pirfenidone improved vital capacity (VC) and prevented acute exacerbation of IPF during the 9 months of follow -up (Azuma et al. 2005) . Although significant adverse events were associated with pirfenidone, tr eatment adherence was similar between the pirfenidone and placebo groups. In fact, the study was aborted early on the basis of recommendations from the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) in favor of pirfenidone treatment over placebo. Building on the results of this study, the Clinical Studies Assessing Pirfenidone in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis: Research of Efficacy and Safety Outcomes (CAPACITY) program included two similar multinational Phase III trials and was designed to confirm the effects of pirfenidone on reducing the decline in lung function (Noble et al. 2011) . Pirfenidone significantly reduced the decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) in one study (Study 004), although the difference between pirfenidone and placebo in FVC change was not significant at W eek72 in the other trial (Study 006). Patients in the pirfenidone group experienced higher rates of several adverse events, including nausea, rash, and vomiting, although fewer overall and deaths related to IPF occur red in the pirfenidone group. Agreeing with the results of Study 004, a further Phase III study in 275 Japanese patients found that treatment with pirfenidone decreased the rate of decline in VC and increased the progression -free survival (PFS) time over 5 2 weeks (Taniguchi et al. 2010 ). Owing to the discrepancies between the results of the three Phase III trials, a further subsequent trial was initiated to confirm the beneficial effect of pirfenidone on disease progression in p atients with IPF (King Jr. et al. 2014 ). This trial enrolled 555 patients with IPF and found that pirfenidone reduced disease progression, as reflected by reduced declines in lung function and exercise"
28,page_28,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 28/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0tolerance, and improved PFS. P irfenidone treatment was also associated with an acceptable side- effect profile and fewer deaths compared with placebo. Following on the positive clinical results achieved, pirfenidone was approved in a 267 mg capsule dosage form for the treatment of IPF i n the United States (US), and for the treatment of mild to moderate IPF in the European Economic Area (EEA) and Canada (Esbriet SmPC 2015 ; Health Canada 2016 ; US FDA 20 15). The recommended daily maintenance dose in patients with IPF is 2403 mg/d, administered as three 267 mg capsules (801 mg) three times daily (TID) with food, at the same times each day (Esbriet SmPC 2015; US FDA 2015 ). Refer to pirfenidone Investigator's Brochure or local prescribing information for pirfenidone for details on nonclinical and clinical studies. 1.3 TRIA L RA TIONA LE AND BENEFIT -RISK ASSESSM ENT No approved treatments are available for the 15% of patients with ILD who have unclassifiable disease. Rather, therapeutic management is based on the most probable diagnosis after multidisciplinary discussions and consideration of the expected disease beha vior (Antoniou et al. 2014) . The data for pirfenidone in IPF are sufficiently encouraging (Section 1.2) to hypothesize t hat a beneficial clinical effect would also be observed with this agent in patients with unclassifiable fibrosing ILD. There are several key areas for uncertainty in the assessment of the benefit -risk profile for pirfenidone in the unclassifiable ILD patie nt population. Fibrosing ILD might have a different natural history compared with IPF and the efficacy of pirfenidone treatment may be different in patients with unclassifiable ILD compared with patients with IPF. MMF may have an effect on the disease cour se of patients with unclassifiable ILD, in particular patients with interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF). Patients may be receiving treatment with MMF as a concomitant therapy at the start of the trial and therefore the patient population in this trial will be stratified according to use of MMF (MMF treatment includes mycophenolate mofetil/sodium or mycophenolic acid). Patients receiving MMF concomitant therapy at the start of the trial are allowed to continue with this treatment throughou t the study including the 24- week double -blind and 12 -month safety follow -up periods. A similar approach had been used previously in a study of the safety and tolerability of pirfenidone in patients with systemic sclerosis −related ILD (SSc - ILD; an open -Label, randOmized, Phase 2 sTUdy of the safety and tolerability of pirfenidone when administered to patients with Systemic Sclerosis −related interstitial lung disease [LOTUSS]) (Khanna et al. 2016 ). The results of this trial also include data concerning the use of MMF as concomitant treatment with pirfenidone. The conclusion from this trial was that MMF, which was taken concomitantly with pirfenidone by 63.5% of patients, did not appear to affect the tolerability of pirfenidone and no particular safety concerns were noted following the combined use of MMF and pirfenidone."

D=Day; ICF=informed consent form The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of pirfenidone vs . placebo on lung function parameters by examining the rate of decline in FVC (measured in mL). A handheld spirometry device will be used by the patient to measure daily FVC at home. Confirmatory site (trial center) based FVC measurements will be conducted every 4weeks (see Schedule of Assessments; Appendix 1). Blood samples will be obtained from patients in order to analyze clinical laboratory values and biomarkers. The secondary objective for this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of pirfenidone vs. placebo on other functional parameters, outcomes, and patient -reported outcomes (PROs). Part of this objective will involve measuring the changes in FVC and comparing the results with baseline findings. In addition, the changes from baseline to the end of the 24 -week double -blind treatment period will be investigated for several parameters, including percent predicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLco), 6 -minute walk distance (6M WD), University of California, San Diego -Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD -SOBQ) score, Leicester Cough Questionnaire, cough visual analog scale, and total and sub- scores of the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ; see Appendix 2and the Study Manual for further information). All of these assessments will be conducted at baseline, W eek12, W eek24, and at the Early Treatment Discontinuation Visit (see Schedule of Assessments; Appendix 1). PFS will also be evaluated as part of this trial, which is defined as the time to the first occurrence of a >10% absolute decline in percent predicted FVC (measured during a clinic visit), a >50 m decline of 6M WD, or death. An alternative definition of PFS, that is the time to"
33,page_33,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 33/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0the first occurrence of a >10% relative decline in FVC (measured during a clinic visit), non-elective respiratory hospitalization , or death, will also be evaluated. Further analyses will investigate the incidences of non -elective respiratory and all cause hospitalization, time to death from any cause, and time to death from respiratory diseases. The safety objective for this trial i nvolves evaluating the safety of pirfenidone in comparison with placebo. In order to achieve this objective, the nature, frequency, severity, and timing of treatment -emergent adverse events will be documented. Dose reductions and treatment interruptions an d withdrawals from trial treatment or trial discontinuations will also be evaluated. Clinical laboratory assessments and electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be collected as per the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix 1). The exploratory objectives for this trial are to evaluate the role of MMF treatment in ILD and to investigate potential biomarkers associated with fibrosis and ILD. To achieve the MMF objective, patients will be stratified according to whether they received treatment with MMF. The efficacy and safety data will be analyzed according to this stratification. For the biomarker objective, an investigation will be conducted with the aim of determining the impact of pirfenidone on exploratory inflammatory and fibrotic biomarkers. Transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of markers associated with the molecular pathways and cellular processes of lung injury and fibrosis will be measured. An independent Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will review safety data and advise on trial conduct at least three times during the trial. A first meeting is planned 6 months after start of recruitment, and subsequently at 12 and 18 months. Additional ad hoc meetin gs or data reviews can be requested at any time by the iDMC or the Sponsor, if warranted. The iDMC will be an independent body who will recommend to continue, modify or stop the trial at each meeting. The procedures that will be used by the iDMC will be detailed in an iDMC charter. 3.2 END OF TRIA L AND LENGTH OF TRIA L After completion of the double -blind treatment period and the Follow -up Visit at Week 28, the Sponsor will offer the possibility to the patients to receive open -label pirfenidone within the trial protocol in a safety follow -up period of up to 12 months . The end of the clinical trial is defined as the date when the last patient, last visit (LPLV) occurs or the date at which the last data point which is required for the statistical analysis is received, whichever is the later date. For this trial, LPLV will o ccur when the last patient has completed the final safety Follow -up Visit, 28 days after the final open -label dose, or when the last data point is collected in the safety follow -period. For each patient the total length of the trial is expected to be up t o a maximum of 91weeks. The trial duration includes the washout period of up to 4 weeks, the screening period of up to 3 weeks, the double -blind treatment period of 24 weeks, the follow -up"
34,page_34,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 34/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0period of 4 weeks, the open -label safety follow -up period up to 12 months (52 weeks) and a final safety Follow -up Visit 4 weeks after the last dose. 3.3 RATIONA LE FOR TRIA L DESIGN 3.3.1 Rationale for Pirfenidone Dose and Schedule In this trial, pirfenidone will be administered at a daily dose of 2403 mg. This dose will be administ ered orally in the form of three 267 mg capsules (801 mg) TID with food, at the same times each day. This dosing schedule is the same as the clinically recommended daily maintenance dose for patients with IPF (Esbriet SmPC 2015; US FDA 2015 ). For each patient, the double -blind trial treatment period will last 24 weeks. Previous clinical studies have demonstrated that clinically significant differences in mean FVC changes from baseline have been observe d in pirfenidone -treated compared with placebo -treated patients over this time frame (Noble et al. 2011 ). It is therefore assumed that this treatment period will be sufficient to observe any statistically significant differences in the primary endpoint. Moreover, recent data suggest that daily FVC measurements may be more sensitive to detect significant declines in lung function (Russell et al. 2016 ). The enrolled patients are therefore required to conduct daily spirometry assessments. 3.3.2 Rationale for Patient Population No approved treatments are currently available to treat patients with ILD who have unclassifiable disease. Therefore, there is an unmet need to develop effective and well tolerated therapies for the treatment of patients with ILD. Patients will be assigned to the category “unclassifiable ILD” if the participating investigator’s MDT cannot assign a case of fibrosing ILD with moderate or high confidence to any category of fibrosing ILD. As patie nts who fulfil the proposed research classification criteria for IPAF do not have CTD -ILD or other defined form of ILD, they will also be included within the unclassifiable ILD category. The MDT will use the available clinical, radiologic, or pathological evidence (with the involvement of rheumatology expertise at the discretion of the MDT team) to attempt to diagnose the patient with a category of fibrosing ILD (e.g., IPF, CTD -ILD, NSIP, cHP, or ILDs caused by occupational exposure or drugs ). In the absenc e of a surgical lung biopsy or transbronchial lung cryobiopsy, the investigator must state the reason a biopsy was not performed. The available clinical, radiologic, or pathologic evidence used by the MDT will be documented in the electronic Case Report Fo rm (eCRF). In this context, the levels of confidence are defined as follows: High confidence: a specific diagnosis is highly likely (i.e., usual interstitial pneumonia [UIP] pattern on high -resolution computed tomography [HRCT] in the case of IPF) Moderate confidence: the MDT arrives at a “working diagnosis” of a particular ILD which is sufficient to lead to a specific therapeutic strategy (i.e. antifibrotic therapy in the case of IPF, immunosuppressive therapy in the case of CTD -ILD)"
35,page_35,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 35/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0Low confidence: the MD T may have a suspicion of a particular ILD but considers the available evidence insufficient to inform therapeutic strategy. The following, non -exhaustive, list of patient populations will therefore be eligible for enrollment: Patients with “unclassifiable ILD” Patients fulfilling research classification criteria for IPAF (Fischer et al. 2015) Patients with a low confidence diagnosis of NSIP, cHP, CTD -ILD, etc. Patients diagnosed with any fibrosing or non- fibrosing ILD with high or moderate confidence will be excluded from the trial. Patients with IPF, irrespective of the level of confidence of diagnosis, cannot be included in the trial. 3.3.3 Rationale for Control Group No approved treatments are available for the p atients with ILD who have unclassifiable disease, and no controlled clinical trials have been performed to date in this patient population. In the absence of any clinically recognized comparator, patients in the control group will receive placebo treatment during the 24 -week double -blind treatment period. 3.3.4 Rationale for Concomitant MMF Therapy In this trial, patients may be receiving concomitant therapy with MMF (MMF treatment includes mycophenolate mofetil/sodium or mycophenolic acid) when the trial starts. As MMF may have an effect on the disease course of unclassifiable ILD, patients will be stratified according to whether they received concomitant MMF treatment during the trial (see Section 3.1). In the LOTUSS trial, which included patients with SSc -ILD, all patients who were enrolled on the basis of a stable dose of allowable SSc medication, could receive treatment with MMF. In thi s trial, the maximum allowed dose of MMF was 1.5g two times daily (BID), but the dosage was otherwise left to the discretion of the investigator. For the current trial, a similar treatment approach will be used. MMF will be used at a stable dose of up to 1.5g (or equivalent) BID that should be kept constant unless safety considerations require dose reduction, dose interruption, or stopping MMF altogether. Patients enrolled without MMF treatment should not start MMF during the blinded treatment period. MMF w as chosen as thepermitted concomitant therapy as it is a potential treatment choice in patients who have secondary interstitial lung fibrosis related to autoimmune disease ( Chartrand et al. 2016 , Fischer et al. 2013 , Khanna et al. 2016 , Volkman et al. 2016 ). In addition, MMF is used in patients with autoimmune fibrosis of an unknown etiology. Recruitment into the trial would be limited, if con comitant MMF treatment was not permitted for patients who are receiving therapeutic benefit from this treatment. Allowing"
36,page_36,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 36/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0MMF as concomitant therapy also enables the clinical community to gather further information on the safety of MMF in this patient popu lation. 3.3.5 Rationale for Biomarker A ssessments Certain biomarkers may be differentially expressed in patients with unclassifiable ILD and may change as a result of pirfenidone treatment (e.g., possibly cytokines, chemokines, and other cellular and molecular markers of lung injury and fibrosis). The blood biomarker samples that are being obtained for this trial may help identify the serum and plasma proteins or blood ribonucleic acid (RNA) biomarkers rela ted to disease progression and/or may be used to assess their response to pirfenidone therapy. Transcriptomic and protein markers associated with the molecular pathways and cellular processes of lung injury and fibrosis will be measured. This may include, but is not restricted to, measurement of CCL18, MMP7, CXCL13, and COMP. Serum, plasma, and whole blood (for RNA analysis) samples will be acquired at baseline, Week4, Week12, W eek24, and at the Early Treatment Discontinuation Visit (see the Schedule of Assessments; Appendix 1). Optional Research Biosample Repository (RBR) whole blood samples for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extraction, described in S ection 4.5.8 of the protocol, will also be collected at baseline to examine genetic polymorphisms and their potential role in the pathogenesis and a ssociated clinical outcomes of unclassifiable ILD. Patient participation for this assessment is voluntary and declining participation to collect biomarker data will not influence eligibility for this trial. 3.3.6 Rationale for Disease Response –based Endpoints The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of pirfenidone vs. placebo on lung function parameters by examining the rate of decline in FVC measured in mL. FVC will be measured daily using a handheld spirometer by the patient and every 4 weeks at the site (see Schedule of Assessments; Appendix 1) during the 24 -week double -blind treatment period. Changes in FVC have been examined in several different clinical studies which enrolled patients with unclassifiable ILD ( Leung et al. 2015 ; Ryerson et al. 2013 ; Solomon et al. 2013 ), and are generally accepted as a valid measure of disease course in patients with ILD. Other disease response -based parameters that will be examined in this trial include predicted DLco, 6M WD, UCSD -SOBQ, Leicester Cough Questionnaire, cough visual analog scale, and total and subscores o f the SGRQ (see Appendix 2). All of these parameters have been used extensively as disease response -based parameters in studies involving similar pati ent populations (Jones et al. 2011; Key et al. 2010; Ryerson et al. 2014 ; Swigris et al. 2010 , 2012 )."
37,page_37,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 37/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.03.3.7 Rationale for PRO A ssessments Several PRO assessments will be conducted in this trial, including the UCSD -SOBQ, the Leicester Cough Questionnaire, the cough visual analog scale, and the SGRQ (see Appendix 2and the Study Manual for further information). All of these assessments have been used extensively as PRO measures in studies involving similar patient populations (Jones et al. 2011 ; Key et al. 2010; Ryerson et al. 2014 ; Swigris et al. 2010 , 2012 ). No bias is assumed in the results of these assessments. 4.

Re-screening may be considered for patients who do not show sufficient disease deterioration in accordance to the protocol at the time of the initial scree ning. Re - screening is permitted if there is strong evidence of clinical worsening based on the Investigator’s judgement and only upon receipt of official approval from the Study Management Team. In such cases, re- screening may be performed after a minimum of 4-weeks lapse from the initial screening date. 4.2 METHOD OF TREA TMENT ASSIGNMENT A ND BLIND ING Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either pirfenidone versus placebo. The randomization process will be conducted using a validated interactive voice or web - based response system (IxRS). To guard against systematic selection bias and ensure compara bility of treatment groups, the randomization will be stratified by concomitant MMF treatment (yes/no), the presence/absence of IPAF as defined by the MDT. To maintain the double -blind nature of the trial, the pirfenidone and placebo treatments will be ide ntical in appearance (see Section 4.3.1.1 ). The investigational site personnel and the patients will be blinded to treatment assignment following r andomization. The iDMC and any personnel performing any interim analysis (as applicable) will be unblinded to the treatment throughout the trial. If unblinding is necessary for patient management (e.g., in the case of a serious adverse event for which pati ent management might be affected by knowledge of treatment assignment), the investigator will be able to break the treatment code by contacting the IxRS. Treatment codes should not be broken except in emergency situations. The investigator should document and provide an explanation for any premature unblinding (e.g., accidental unblinding, unblinding due to a serious adverse event). Unblinding should not necessarily result in the withdrawal of a patient from the trial. After unblinding, the patient will be withdrawn from the 24- week double -blind treatment period. If the unblinding was based on the investigator’s safety concerns and reveals that the patient had been treated with pirfenidone, the patient will be withdrawn from the trial. In this case, the pati ent will attend the Early Treatment Discontinuation Visit and thus end his/her participation in the trial. However, if unblinding reveals that the patient had not been treated with pirfenidone and that the investigator has no further safety concerns, then the patient may be offered the option to continue into the 12 -month open -label pirfenidone safety follow -up period. In this case, the patient will attend the Early Treatment Discontinuation Visit ( +28 days after the last dose of the double -blind"
41,page_41,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 41/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0treatment) and on the same day begin his/her participation in the 12 -month open -label pirfenidone safety follow -up period. For regulatory reporting purposes, and if required by local health authorities, the Sponsor will break the treatment code for all serious, une xpected suspected adverse reactions (see Section 5.7) that are considered by the investigator or Sponsor to be related to trial treatment. 4.3 TRIA L TRE ATMENT The investigational medicinal product (IMP) for this trial is pirfenidone. 4.3.1 Formulation, Packaging, and Handling 4.3.1.1 Pirfenidone and Placebo Pirfenidone and placebo will be supplied by the Sponsor as 267 mg capsules in a bottle. For information on the formulation and handling of pirfenidone, see the Investigator's Brochure or local prescribing information for pirfenidone. The chemical name of pirfenidone is 5 -methyl -1-phenyl -2-1(H)-pyridone. Pirfenidone (pirfenidone 267 mg) will be supplied as white, hard gelatin capsules . Each pirfenidone capsule contains 267 mg of pirfenidone, and the following inactive ingredients: Capsule content: microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, povidone, and magnesium stearate Capsule shell : gelatin and titanium dioxide. Pirfenidone should be stored according to the IMP label and the bottle should be tightly closed. 4.3.2 Dosage, A dministration, and Compliance 4.3.2.1 Pirfenidone and Placebo In this trial, pirfenidone will be administered at a daily dose of 2403 mg. This dose will be administered orally in the form of three 267 mg capsules (801 mg) TID with food, at the same times each day. Patients will initially take one capsule TID with meals. Following treatment initiation, the daily dosage will be ti trated to the full dosage of nine capsules per day over a 14 -day period as outlined in Table 2. Temporary dosage reduction, treatment interruption, or discontinuation should be considered in order to effectively manage any treatment - emergent adverse reactions. Guidelines for dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation are provided in Section 5.1.1 ."
42,page_42,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 42/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0Any overdose or incorrect administration of trial treatment should be noted on the Study Drug Administration eCRF. Adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administr ation of trial treatment should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Section 5.3.5.11 summarizes available safety data related to overdosing of pirfenidone. Placebo will be supplied by the Sponsor in the form of capsules with identical appearance and size as the pirfenidone capsule. The placebo capsules will contain microcrystalline cellulose. Patients will be asked to take the IMP according to sit e instructions. IMP accountability will be performed at the next site visit. 4.3.2.2 Dose Modification/Restarting Treatment Patients should remain on a stable maintenance dose for the duration of the treatment period unless the dose is reduced or dosing is interrupted to manage an adverse event (see Section 5.1.1 ). Any patient with an actual or anticipat ed interruption of trial treatment for a period of ≥ 28 consecutive days will be reported by telephone to Roche‘s medical monitor or designee to discuss the circumstances of the case. Once the patient restarts trial treatment, the dose must be re -titrated over 14 days as described in Table 2 . 4.3.3 Investigational Medicinal Product A ccountability The IMP required for completion of this trial (pirfenidone) wil l be provided by the Sponsor. The trial site will acknowledge receipt of IMPs, using the IxRS, to confirm the shipment condition and content. Any damaged shipments will be replaced. IMPs either will be disposed of at the trial site according to the trial s ite’s institutional standard operating procedure or will be returned to the Sponsor with the appropriate documentation. The site's method of IMP destruction must be agreed to by the Sponsor. The site must obtain written authorization from the Sponsor befor e any IMP is destroyed, and IMP destruction must be documented on the appropriate form. Accurate records of the IMP received at, dispensed from, returned to, and disposed of by the trial site should be recorded on the Drug Inventory Log. 4.3.4 Continued A ccess t o Pirfenidone After completion of the double -blind treatment period , the Sponsor will offer the possibility to the patients to receive continued access to pirfenidone in a safety follow -up period of up to 12 months, within this clinical trial protocol . A final Follow -up Visit will be performed at the end of the safety period, 28 days after the last open -label dose. At the end of the 24 -week double -blind treatment period, in order to maintain blinding, all patients will discontinue treatment over a 28 -day pe riod and return for the Follow -up Visit."
43,page_43,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 43/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0For patients who could benefit from participating in the 12- month safety follow -up period, according to the investigator’s judgment, open -label pirfenidone will be started on the 28 - day Follow -up Visit, using the ti tration schedule in Table 2 . During the 12 -month safety follow -up period, initially, patients will be evaluated at monthly visits for the first 6 months. At the end of the first 6 months , patients will be evaluated at each site visit occurring approximately every 3 months until the end of the safety follow -up period. In addition, at the end of the first 6 months, patients will perform home pregnancy tests at each month where there is no site visit. Patients will be provi ded with home pregnancy test kits and will be instructed to contact the site immediately should the test result be positive. In such cases, the patient must visit the site for a confirmatory serum pregnancy test. Refer to Schedule of Assessments for the as sessments to be performed during this safety follow -up period ( Appendix 1). The dose of pirfenidone used during the safety follow -up period is in accor dance to section 4.3.2.1. Following the end of the 12- month safety follow -up period, the Sponsor will offer post - trial access to the trial treatment (pirfenidone) ,free of charge ,to eligible patients in accordance with the Roche Global Policy on Continued Access to IMP, as outlined below. A patient will be eligible to receive Pirfenidone (Esbriet®) after completing the trial if allof the following conditions are met: The patient has a life- threatening or severe medical condition and requires continued trial treatment for his or her well -being There are no appropriate alternative treatments available to the patient The patient and his or her doctor comply with and satisfy any legal or regulatory requirements that apply to them. A patient will not be eligible to receive Pirfenidone (Esbriet®) after completing the trial if anyof the following conditions are met: Pirfenidone (Esbriet®) is commercially marketed in the patient's country and is reasonably accessible to the patient (e.g., is covered by the patient's insurance or would not otherwise create a financial hardship for the patient) The Sponsor has discontinued development of Pirfenidone (Esbriet®) or data suggest that Pirfenidone (Esbriet®) is not effective for unclassifiable ILD The Sponsor ha s safety concerns regarding Pirfenidone (Esbriet®) as treatment for unclassifiable ILD Provision of Pirfenidone (Esbriet®) is not permitted under the laws and regulations of the patient's country.

44,page_44,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 44/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.04.4 CONCOMITA NT THERA PY AND PROHIBITED FOOD Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a patient from the washout period until 28 days after the last dose of trial treatment. All such medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF. 4.4.1 Permitted Therapy All protocol -allowed medications taken by the patient for concomitant disease(s) should be continued as necessary during the tr ial and be recorded on the eCRF. Treatments prescribed to patients should be adapted according to the local standard of care practice. 4.4.2 Prohibited Therapy Use of the following therapies is prohibited during the trial and should be tapered and/or discontinued in the 28days prior to screening: Investigational therapy other than trial treatment High dose systemic corticosteroids (15 mg/d of prednisolone or equivalent) for longer than 28 days Immunosuppressive therapies (e.g. azathioprine) Treatment with NAC for fibrotic lung disease, at any time within the 4 weeks of the screening period ; intermittent use of NAC for other conditions is permitted Fluvoxamine and other cytochrome P450 1A2 ( CYP1A2) inhibitors CYP1A2 inducers. If down titration of prohib ited therapy is required, it must be done during the 28 -day washout period. 4.4.2.1 Corticosteroids Pirfenidone should not be used in combination with high -dose corticosteroids (>15 mg/day) for periods longer than 28 days. Co -administration of pirfenidone with lower doses of corticosteroids is at the discretion of the investigator. 4.4.2.2 Fluvoxamine and Other CYP1A2 Inhibitors In a Phase I study, the co -administration of pirfenidone and fluvoxamine (a strong inhibitor of CYP1A2 with inhibitory effects on other CYP isoenzymes [CYP2C9, 2C19, and 2D6]) resulted in a 4 -fold increase in exposure to pirfenidone in non -smokers (Esbriet SmPC 2015 ). Pirfenidone is therefore contraindicated in patients who are receiving concomitant fluvoxamine. Fluvoxamine treatment should be discontinued prior to the initiation of pirfenidone therapy and avoided during thera py due to the reduced clearance of pirfenidone. Other therapies that are inhibitors of both CYP1A2 and one or more other CYP isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of pirfenidone (e.g. CYP2C9, 2C19, and 2D6) should be avoided during pirfenidone treatment."
45,page_45,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 45/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0In vitro and in vivo extrapolations have indicated that strong and selective inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g. enoxacin) have the potential to increase the exposure to pirfenidone by approximately 2 to 4 -fold (Esbriet SmPC 2015) . If concomitant use of pirfenidone with a strong and selective inhibitor of CYP1A2 cannot be avoided, the dose of pirfenidone should be reduced to 801 mg daily (one capsule TID). Co-administration of pirfenidone and 750 mg of ciprofloxacin (a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2) increased the exposure to pirfenidone by 81% (Esbriet SmPC 2015 ). If ciprofloxacin at a dose of 750 mg BID cannot be avoided, the dose of pirfenidone should be reduced to 1602 mg daily (two capsules TID). Pirfeni done should be used with caution when ciprofloxacin is used at a dose of 250 mg or 500 mg once or twice daily. Pirfenidone should also be used with caution in patients treated with other moderate inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g. amiodarone, propafenone). Caution should be exercised if CYP1A2 inhibitors are being used concomitantly with pirfenidone and potent inhibitors of one or more of the other CYP isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of pirfenidone (Esbriet SmPC 2015 ). These iso enzymes include CYP2C9 (inhibitors include amiodarone and fluconazole), CYP2C19 (inhibitors include chloramphenicol), and CYP2D6 (inhibitors include fluoxetine and paroxetine). 4.4.2.3 CYP1A 2 Inducers Concomitant use of strong inducers of CYP1A2 should be avoided during pirfenidone therapy following the results of a Phase I interaction study that found that pirfenidone exposure was 50% lower in smokers compared with non -smokers (Esbriet SmPC 2015) . Smoking induces the CYP1A2 isoenzyme . Patients should therefore be encouraged to discontinue the use of strong inducers of CYP1A2 and to stop smoking before and during treatment with pirfenidone. In the case of moderate inducers of CYP1A2 (e.g. omeprazole), concomitant use may theoretically result in a lowering of pirfenidone plasma levels (Esbriet SmPC 2015 ). Co-administration of pirfenidone with medicinal products that act as potent inducers of both CYP1A2 and the other CYP isoenzymes involved in the metabolis m of pirfenidone (e.g., rifampicin) may result in significant lowering of pirfenidone plasma levels (Esbriet SmPC 2015) . These medicinal products should therefore be avoided whenever possible. 4.4.2.4 Other Medications The above lists of medications are not necessarily comprehensive. Thus, the investigator should consult the prescribing information for any concomitant medication as well as the Internet references provided below when determining whether a certain medication strongl y inhibits or induces CYP1A2. In addition, the investigator should contact the Medical Monitor if questions arise regarding specific medications not listed above."

Informed Consent Forms for enrolled patients and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the trial site. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients mee t all eligibility criteria before enrollment. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. 4.5.2 Medical History and Demographic Data Medical history includes clinically significant respiratory diseases (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and pneumonia), reproductive status, smoking history, use of alcohol, and drugs of abuse. In addition, all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by the patient from the washout period until 28 days after the last dose of trial treatment will be recorded. Demographic data will include age, sex, and self-reported race/ethnicity. 4.5.3 Physical Examinations A complete physical examination will be performed at screening and will include an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respirato ry, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurological systems. Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF."
47,page_47,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 47/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited, symptom -direct ed physical examinations will be performed (see the Schedule of Assessments; Appendix 1). Changes from baseline abnormalities should be recorded in pat ient notes. New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. 4.5.4 Vital Signs Vital signs will include measurements of respiratory rate, pulse rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures w hile the patient is in a seated position, and temperature. All vital sign measurements are to be obtained prior to any blood draws scheduled at the same time. 4.5.5 FVC FVC is defined as the maximal volume of gas that can be exhaled following full inhalation by exhaling as forcefully and rapidly as possible. FVC has been an established measure of pulmonary function in patients with IPF for many decades (du Bois et al. 2011 ). Longitudinal changes in serial measures of lung volume are a widely accepted reflection of disease progression in patients with IPF and a commonly used primary endpoint in therapeutic studies. If a patient is routinely treated with a short -acting bronchodilator (for example albuterol, salbutamol) , the bronchodilator should be taken approximately 30 minutes prior to the on-site s pirometry . 4.5.6 Handheld Spirometry Patients will perform a single spirometry reading at approximately the same time each day. For this purpose, trial participants will be provided with a portable handheld Micro spirometer ( , England). The Micro spirometer measures FEV 1and FVC by means of a turbine volume transducer and provides a digital read out registered in liters at body temperature and pressure saturated with water vapor (BTPS). Each spirometer will be factory calibrated. Patients will be given 60 minutes dedicated instruction on how to undertake spirometry at the Screening Visit. Patient s will be asked to use the device during the screening period and will be subsequently retrained at the Baseline Visit. Additional refresher training will be provided after 1 month. As the primary endpoint of this trial is to determine the rate of decline in FVC measured by daily handheld spirometer, further support to effectively use this device will be provided to the patients. The Sponsor will select a healthcare company that will be responsible for providing home nursing services for the participating sites. The vendor is responsible for ensuring that all home nursing professionals are licensed, qualified, and in good standing, as per applicable regulations, and that appropriate background checks have been performed."
48,page_48,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 48/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0Sites will communicate directly with the vendor in their country when patients have entered the trial. The trained nursing professional will conduct the visit at the patient’s home or at another suitable location in order to provide handling evaluations and quality assurance for the daily spirometer assessments. The expected number of home visits is stated in the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 1). 4.5.7 Other Trial A ssessments Further information on the other assessments (e.g., FVC, DLco, 6M WD, UCSD -SOBQ, Leicester Cough Questionnaire, cough visual analog scale, and SGRQ) that will be conducted as part of this trial can be found in Appendix 2and the Study Manual. 4.5.8 Laboratory and Biomarker Samples All of the laboratory tests will be conducted by the trial site’s local laboratory. Biomarker samples will first be sent to a centra l laboratory and then to outsourced contract research organizations (CROs) or the Sponsor for testing. The following laboratory and biomarker samples will be collected: Hematology: white blood cell (W BC) count, red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin, hemat ocrit, platelet count, differential count (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, other cells) Chemistry panel (serum or plasma): sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or urea, creatinine, total protein, albumin, phosphorus, calcium, total and direct bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Pregnancy test: All women of childbearing potential will have a serum pregnancy test at screening. Urine pregnancy tests will be performed at specified subsequent visits. If a urine pregnancy test is positive, it must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. Blood samples for exploratory research on biomarkers (see Appendix 1). Exploratory biomarker research may include, but will not be limited to CCL18, MMP7, CXCL13, and COMP. For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual. Unless the patient gives specific consent for his or her leftover samples to be stored for optional exploratory research (see Section 4.5.11 ), biological samples will be destroyed when the final Clinical Study Report has been completed, with the following exceptions: Whole blood, plasma, and serum samples collected for biomarker analyses will be destroyed no later than 5 years after the final Clinical Study Report has been completed."
49,page_49,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 49/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0When a patient withdraws from the trial, samples collected prior to the date of withdrawal may still be analyzed, unless the patient specifically requests that the samples be destroyed or local laws require d estruction of the samples. Data arising from sample analysis will be subject to the confidentiality standards described in Section 8.4. 4.5.9 Electrocardiograms Single ECG recordings will be obtained at specified time points, as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments (see Appendix 1), and m ay be obtained at unscheduled time points as indicated. All ECG recordings must be performed using a standard high -quality, high -fidelity digital electrocardiograph machine equipped with computer -based interval measurements. Lead placement should be as con sistent as possible. ECG recordings must be performed after the patient has been resting in a supine position for at least 10 minutes. All ECGs, when possible, should be obtained prior to other procedures scheduled at the same time (e.g., vital sign measur ements, blood draws). Circumstances that may induce changes in heart rate, including environmental distractions (e.g., television, radio, conversation) should be avoided during the pre -ECG resting period and during ECG recording. For safety monitoring purp oses, the investigator must review, sign, and date all ECG tracings. Paper copies of ECG tracings will be kept as part of the patient's permanent trial file at the site. Digital recordings will be stored at site. The following should be recorded in the app ropriate eCRF: heart rate, RR interval, QRS interval, PR duration, uncorrected QT interval, and the QTcF based on the machine readings of the individual ECG tracings. Any morphologic waveform changes or other ECG abnormalities must be documented on the eCRF. If considered appropriate by the Sponsor, ECGs may be analyzed retrospectively at a central laboratory. Refer to section 5.1.1.8 for details on protocol management of increases in QT interval. 4.5.10 Patient -Reported Outcomes Several PRO assessments will be conducted in this trial, including the UCSD -SOBQ, the Leicester Cough Questionnaire, the cough visual analog scale, and the SGRQ (see Appendix 2). The impact of potential bias on these outcomes will not be investigated. PRO data will be collected via questionnaires to document the treatment effect and to evaluate the benefit of pirfenidone. The questionnaires, translated into the local language as requi red, will be completed in their entirety at specified time points during the trial (see Appendix 1).

WGS provides a comprehensive characterization of the genome and, along with clinical data collected in this trial, may increase the opportunity for developing new therapeutic approaches. Data will be analyzed in the context of this trial but will also be explored in aggregate with data from other studies. The availability of a larger dataset will assist in identification of important pathways, guiding the development of new targeted agents. For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual. RBR specimens are to be stored until they are no longer needed or until they are exhausted. However, the RBR storage period will be in accor dance with the IRB/EC -approved Informed Consent Form and applicable laws (e.g., health authority requirements). 4.5.11.4 Confidentiality Specimens and associated data will be labeled with a unique patient identification number. Patient medical information associated with RBR specimens is confidential and may be disclosed to third parties only as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or separate authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the patient, unless permitted or required by law. Given the complexity and exploratory nature of the analyses, data derived from RBR specimens will generally not be provided to trial investigators or patients unless required by law. The aggregate results of any conducted research will be available in accordance with the effective Sponsor policy on trial data publication. Data generated from RBR specimens must be available for inspection upon request by representatives of national and local health authorities, and Sponsor monitors, representatives, and collaborators, as appropriate.

ASSESSMENT OF SA FETY 5.1 SAFETY P LAN Pirfenidone is approved for the treatment of IPF in the US, and for the treatment of mild to moderate IPF in the EEA and Canada (Esbriet SmPC 2015; Health Canada 2016 ; US FDA 2015) . However, the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in patients with unclassifiable ILD has not been fully elucidated. The safety plan for patients in this trial is based on clinical experience with pirfenidone in completed and ongoing studie s predominately involving patients with IPF. The anticipated important safety risks for pirfenidone are outlined below. Please refer to the pirfenidone Investigator's Brochure for a complete summary of safety information. Several measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this trial. Eligibility criteria have been designed to exclude patients at higher risk for toxicities. Patients will undergo safety monitoring during the trial, including assessment of the nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events. In addition, guidelines for managing adverse events, including criteria for dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation, are provided below. An iDMC will review safety data and advise on trial conduct (see Section 3.1). The procedures that will be used by the iDMC will be detailed in an iDMC charter. 5.1.1 Risks A ssociated with Pirfenidone Treatment with pirfenidone was consistent with the known safety profile a nd generally well tolerated in patients who received treatment in the clinical development program. Almost all patients experienced an adverse event (99.0% in the pirfenidone 2403 mg/day group and 97.9% in the placebo group). The most common adverse events in the pirfenidone group were GI events (nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD], and constipation), respiratory -related events (cough, dyspnea, IPF, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis), fatigue, decreased weight, anorexia, back pain, arthralgia, headache, dizziness, insomnia, rash, and photosensitivity reactions. 5.1.1.1 Hepatic Function Elevations in ALT and AST >3 ×ULN have been reported in patients receiving therapy with pirfenid one. Rarely, these have been associated with concomitant elevations in bilirubin. LFTs (ALT, AST, and bilirubin) should be conducted prior to the initiation of treatment with pirfenidone and subsequently at monthly intervals for the first 6 months. In the event of significant elevation of liver aminotransferases, the dose of pirfenidone should be adjusted or treatment discontinued according to the guidelines listed in Table 3. See Sections 5.4.2.11 and 6.4.1 of the Investigator’s Brochure for more details."

Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in Section 5.4. 5.2.1 Adverse Events According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation patient administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal attribution. An adverse event can therefore be any of the following: Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a kno wn condition), except as described in Section 5.3.5.9 Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is associated with symptoms or leads to a change in trial treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation from trial treatment Adverse events that are related to a pro tocol -mandated intervention, including those that occur prior to assignment of trial treatment (e.g., screening invasi ve procedures such as biopsies) 5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor) A serious adverse event is any adverse eve nt that meets any of the following criteria: Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at immediate risk of death) oThis does not include any adverse event that had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue might have caused death. Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.10) Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life functions)"

Severity refers to the intensity of an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE] ; see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache without any further findings). Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event recorded on the eCRF. Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the eve nt; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). 5.2.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor) Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). Adverse events of special interest for this trial include the following: Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in combination with either an elev ated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy’s law (see Section 5.3.5.6) Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the trial treatme nt, as defined below: Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non -pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an infectious agent may be susp ected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product. This term applies only when a contamination of the trial treatment is suspected. 5.3 METHODS A ND TIMING F OR CA PTURING A ND ASSESSING SAFETY PARAMETERS The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for definition) are recorded on the Adverse E vent eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Sections 5.45.6."
60,page_60,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 60/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator wi ll make an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ). 5.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact. All adverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by trial personnel, will be recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. After informed c onsent has been obtained but prior to initiation of trial treatment , only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events). After initiation of trial treatment , all adverse events will be reported until 28 days after the last dose of trial treatment (Follow -up Visit). Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting period are provided in Section 5.6. 5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting adverse event information at all patient evaluation time points. Examples of non -directive questions include the following: ""How have you felt since your last clinic visit?"" ""Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?"" 5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of A dverse Events The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v4.0) will be used for assessing adverse event severity.

The following guidance should be take n into consideration: Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of trial treatment Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, discontinuation of trial treatment, or reintroduction of trial treatment (as applicable) Known association of the event with the trial treatment or with similar treatments Known association of the event with the disease under study Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to increase the occurr ence of the event Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated w ith the occurrence of the event 5.3.5 Procedures for Recording A dverse Events Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse event s on the Adverse Event eCRF. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations."
62,page_62,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 62/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.3.5.1 Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a sin gle diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and r eplaced by one adverse event report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 5.3.5.2 Adverse Events That A re Secondary to Other Events In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious secondary events. A medically significant secondary adverse event that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Event eCRF. For example: If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF If vomiting result s in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all t hree events should be reported separately on the eCRF If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is unclear as to wh ether the events are associated. 5.3.5.3 Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation time points. Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF. The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be recorded at the time the event is first reported. If a persistent adverse event becomes more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the eve nt becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated by"
63,page_63,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 63/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0changing the event from ""non -serious"" to ""serious,"" providing the date that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events. A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation time points and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.3.5.4 Abnormal Laboratory Values Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: Is accompanied by clinical symptoms Results in a change in trial treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or early treatment discontinuation) Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a change in concomitant therapy Is clinically significant according to the investigator’s judgment It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant laboratory ab normality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a clinically significant laboratory abnorma lity is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., ""elevated potassium,"" as opposed to ""abno rmal potassium""). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recor ded as ""hyperkalemia."" Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.3 for details on recording persistent adverse events). 5.3.5.5 Abnormal Vital Sign Values Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: Is accompanied by clinical symptoms Results in a change in trial treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or early treatment discontinuation)"

Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormalit y should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Observation s of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.3 for details on recording persistent adverse events). 5.3.5.6 Abnormal Liver Function Tests The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3ULN) in combination with either an elevated total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as defined by Hy's law). Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of the following: Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with total bilirubin 2ULN Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in com bination with clinical jaundice The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.1) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either as a serious adverse event or an adverse event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 ). 5.3.5.7 Deaths For this protocol, mortality from any cause and mortality from respiratory diseases are included as efficacy endpoints. Mortality is also included as part of the PFS efficacy endpoint. Deaths that occur during the protocol -specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1 ) that are attributed by the investigator solely to progression of unclassifiable ILD should be recorded on the Death Attributed to Progressive Disease eCRF. All other on -trial deaths, regardless of relationship to trial treatment, must be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ). The iDMC will monitor the frequency of deaths in this trial. Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event. The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as t he single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported."
65,page_65,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 65/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0The term ""sudden death"" should be used only for the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or wit hout pre-existing heart disease, within 1 hour after the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case of an unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the patient was last seen alive and stable. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the ti me of reporting, ""unexplained death"" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), ""unexplained death"" should be replaced by the established cause of death. Deaths that occur after the adverse event reporting period should be reported as described in Section 5.6. 5.3.5.8 Pre-existing Medical Conditions A pre -existing medical condition is one that is present at the Screening Visit for this trial. Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. A pre -existing medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency, severity , or character of the condition worsens during the trial. W hen recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the pre -existing condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., ""more frequent headaches""). 5.3.5.9 Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Unclassifiable ILD Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the underlying disease should notbe recorded as adverse events. These data will be captured as efficacy assessment data only. In most cases, the expected pattern of progression will be based on ≥10% relative decline in FVC or a >50 m decline in 6MWD. In rare cases, the determination of clinical progression will be based on symptomatic deterioration or a decline in DLco of ≥15%. However, every effort should be made to document progression through use of objective criteria. If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse event. 5.3.5.10 Hospitali zation or Prolonged Hospitalization Any adverse event that results in hospitalization (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospital) or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 ), except as outlined below. The following hospitalization scenarios are notconsidered to be adverse events: Hospitalizatio n for respite care"

An overdose or incorrect administration of trial treatment is not itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event. All adverse e vents associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of trial treatment should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).

However, if any PRO responses suggestive of a possible adverse event are identified during site review of the PRO data, the in vestigator will determine whether the criteria for an adverse event have been met and, if so, will report the event on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.4 IMMEDIA TE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM INVESTIGA TOR TO SPON SOR Certain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial. The investigator must report such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take place more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event. The following is a list of events that the investigator must report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to trial treatment: Serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for further details) Adverse events of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 for further details) Pregnancies (see Section 5.4.3 for further details) The investigator must report new significant follow -up information for these events to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information). New significant information includes the following: New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis Significant new diagnostic test results Change in causality based on new information Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery Additional narrative information on t he clinical course of the event Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse events to the local health authority and IRB/EC. 5.4.1 Emergency Medical Contacts Medical Monitor Contact Information for all sites Medical Monitor/Roche Medical Responsible: (Primary) Mobile Telephone No.: Medical Monitor/Roche Medical Responsible: (Secondary) Mobile Telephone No.: Alternate Medical Monitor Contact Information for all sites Roche Medical Responsible: Telephone No.:"

Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. The investigator should discontinue trial treatment and counsel the pati ent, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus. Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. Any serious adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event i n the mother during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. In addition, the investigator will submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available. 5.4.3.2 Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients Male patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately inform the investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the t rial or within 118days after the last dose of trial treatment. A Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators. Attempts should be made to collect and report details of the course and outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to trial treatment. The pregnant partner will need to sign an Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health Information to allow for follow -up on her pregnancy. After the authorization has been signed, the investigator will submit a Clinical Trial Pregna ncy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available. An investigator who is contacted by the male patient or his pregnant partner may provide information on the risks of the pregnancy and the possible ef fects on the fetus, to support an informed decision in cooperation with the treating physician and/or obstetrician. 5.4.3.3 Abortions Any abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as the Sponsor considers abortions to be medically significant), rec orded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). 5.4.3.4 Congenital A nomalies/Birth Defects Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to trial treatment or the female partner of a male patient exposed to trial treatment should be classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 )."

73,page_73,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 73/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed. Certain adverse events are anticipated to occur in the trial population at some freque ncy independent of trial treatment exposure and will be excluded from expedited reporting. These anticipated events include, but are not limited to, the following: Cough Dyspnea Hypoxemia Lung crepit ations The iDMC will monitor the incidence of the above- listed anticipated events during the trial. An aggregate report of any clinically relevant imbalances that do not favor the test product will be submitted to health authorities. 6. STATISTICA L CONSIDER ATIONS AND ANAL YSIS PLAN The intent -to-treat (ITT) populat ion is defined as all randomized patients. Patients in the ITT population will be assigned to the treatment groups as randomized. The safety population is defined as all treated patients (at least one drug intake of pirfenidone or placebo). Patients in the safety population will be assigned to treatment groups according to the treatment they received. 6.1 DETERMINA TION OF SA MPLE SIZE The purpose of this trial is hypothesis generation regarding the efficacy of pirfenidone vs. placebo on lung function parameters on the basis of rate of decline in FVC, as measured by daily handheld spirometry. A total sample size of approximately 250 patients is planned, and patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The randomization will be stratified by concomitant MMF treatmen t (yes/no), the presence/absence of IPAF as defined by the MDT. The planned sample size is based on the statistical hypothesis of the primary endpoint and assumes 80% power and a two -sided significance level of 5% using a student’s t - test. It is assumed, a fter inspection of historical data, that FVC decline in the placebo arm is 85 mL with a common standard deviation of 70 mL, which can be reduced to 60mL with a common standard deviation of 70 mL in the pirfenidone arm. In this scenario, 125 patients per t reatment arm are needed to detect this treatment effect with 80% power. These assumptions are based upon the following considerations: in IPF, the annual rate of decline of FVC is approximately 200 mL. Owing to the fact that patients with unclassifiable IL D have rates of disease progression in the range of patients with IPF ,"
74,page_74,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 74/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0albeit with a lower mortality rate (Ryerson et al. 2013 ),a similar decline rate of 200mL/year, equivalent to a 100 mL decline over a treatment period of 24 weeks, can be expected. However, a yet unknown proportion of patients in this trial will be treated concomitantly with MMF. In a previous study of CTD -ILD (Fischer et al. 2013 ), MMF was found to have beneficial effects on lung functions in these patients. While CTD -ILD is a distinct entity from the current trial population, both conditions may share some autoimmune features. Therefore assuming a smaller FVC decline of 85 mL in the placebo arm compared with 60 mL in the pirfenidone arm over the 24 -week double -blind treatment period appears justified. In addition, the potential confounding effect of concomitant MMF therapy in these patients justifies stratification to ensure equal distribution of patients who receiv e and do not receive treatment with MMF. 6.2 SUMMA RIES OF CONDUCT OF TRI AL Patient enrollment, trial treatment administration, and reasons for early treatment discontinuation and trial discontinuation will be summarized for all enrolled patients. In addition, protocol deviations and eligibility violations will be summarized by frequency tables. 6.3 SUMMA RIES OF DEMOGRA PHIC AND BA SELINE CHA RACTERISTICS Demographics and baseline characteristics, such as age, sex, and race, will be summarized by treatment arm using means or medians for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables as well as appropriate measures of variability. Medical history will be tabulated by treatment arm. Summary of concomitant medications will be displayed by treatment arm in frequency tables. 6.4 EFFICA CY ANAL YSES The primary and secondary efficacy analyses will include all randomized patients, with patients grouped according to their assigned treatment. 6.4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint The primary efficacy objective for this trial is t o evaluate the efficacy of pirfenidone vs. placebo on lung function parameters on the basis of rate of decline in FVC in mL measured by handheld spirometry over the 24 -week double -blind treatment period (see Section 2). The primary analysis will be based on the ITT population. Patients who discontinue treatment prematurely will be analyzed based on the available data. No imputation method will be applied. The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will compare the mean FVC decline in each treatment arm using a student’s t -test with a two- sided significance level α=0.05. The mean FVC decline for each treatment arm will be calculated using the esti mated FVC decline for each individual patient. The individual FVC decline will be estimated by"

In a similar manner to the primary endpoint data, patients who discontinue early will be analyzed based on the data collected until withdrawal. Thesecondary efficacy objective for this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of pirfenidone compared with placebo on the basis of the following endpoints: The decline of FVC in mL measured by spirometry during site (clinic) visits will be compared between the treatment arms in the same fashion as described for the primary endpoint Change in percent predicted FVC measured by spirometry during site visits will be compared between the treatment arms using a rank analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Change from baselin e will be used as an outcome variable and standardized rank baseline value will be used as a covariate Categorical changes in FVC of >5% and >10% will be compared between the treatment arms using a Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel test stratified by geographic region, concomitant MMF medication use, and the presence/absence of IPAF as defined by the MDT Change in percent predicted DLco will be compared between the treatment arms using a rank ANCOVA. Change from baseline will be used as an outcome variable and standa rdized rank baseline value will be used as a covariate The change in 6M WD will be analyzed using a rank ANCOVA model.

78,page_78,"Pirfenidone —F.Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd 78/Protocol MA39189 , Version 3.0manually will be collected via EDC through use of eCRFs. Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system. In the event of discrepant data, the CRO will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. The CRO will produce a Data Quality Plan that describes the quality checking to be performed on the data. The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this trial, including approval of the CRO’s data management plans and specifications. Data will be periodically transferred electronically from the CRO to t he Sponsor, and the Sponsor’s standard procedures will be used to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data. eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail. System backups for data stored at the CRO and records retention for the trial data will be consistent with the CRO’s standard procedures. PRO data will be collected on paper questionnaires. The data from the questionnaires will be entered into the EDC system by site staff. 7.2 ELECTRONIC CA SE REPO RT FORM S eCRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -designated EDC system. Sites will receive training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion. eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in accordance with instructions from the Sponsor. All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff. eCRFs should be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee. At the end of the trial, the investigator will receive pati ent data for his or her site in a readable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the trial records. Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is required. 7.3 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION Trial monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorde d and documented for the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and site charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, PROs, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies o f transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete,"

A final Follow -up Visit will be performed at the end of the safety period, 28 ( 5) days after the last open -label dose. dInformed consent must be documented before any trial -specific screening procedure is per formed, and may be obtained either at the W ashout or Screening Visits. eAny procedures that were not completed during washout, must be completed at the Screening Visit. fIncludes respiratory rate, pulse rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures while the patient is in a seated position, and temperature. Abnormalities observed at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. At subsequ ent visits, new or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. All vital sign measurements are to be obtained prior to any blood draws scheduled at the same time. gIncludes evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat, and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskel etal, respirator y, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and neurological systems. Abnormalities observed at baseline should be recorded on the Gener al Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.

Urine pregnanc y tests will be performed at the specified subsequent vis its. If aurine pregnancy test is positive, it must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. During the Safety Follow -up period, urine pregnancy tests will be performed every month during the first 6 months at each site visit. Urine pregnanc y tests will continue to be perform ed on a monthly basis during the remainder of the Safety Follow -up period with patients performing the test at home (using kits pro vided by the site) during months where there is no site visit and at each site visit occurring approximately every 3 months. Patients will be instructed to contact the site immediately in case the result of the home pregnancy test is positive. In such case s, the patient must visit the site for a confirmatory serum pregnancy test. mOpen -label treatment with pirfenidone will be started at this visit, if the patient requests continued treatment with pirfenidone. nHandheld spirometry will be conducted by the patient ever y day in a seated position. oTo provide handling evaluations and quality assurance for the daily spirometer assessments, nursing visits to the patient’s home (or at another suitable location) will occur at least three times during the trial, n amely between Weeks 1 and 4, between Weeks 8 and 12, and between Weeks16 and 20.

After initiation of trial treatment , alladverse events will be reported until 28 days after the last dose of trial treatment . After this period, all deaths, regardless of cause, should be reported. In addition, the Sponsor sho uld be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious adverse event that is believed to be related to prior trial treatment (see Section 5.6). The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the in vestigator, the patient is lost to follow -up, or the patient withdraws consent. Every effort should be m ade to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to trial treatment or trial -related procedures until a final outcome can be reported. tNot applicable for a site that has not been granted approval for RBR sampling. u If a patient discont inues the trial between weeks 24 and 28, final assessments according to the Follow -up visit for week 28 should be performed."
