Patients will be randomized 3:1 to ALN -TTRSC02 or patisiran -LNP , a reference comparator. Randomization will be stratified by TTR genotype (V30M vs. non -V30M) and baseline NIS score (<50 vs ≥50). The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 42 days, an 18 -month Treatment Period, a n 18-month Treatment Extension Period which will include collection of safety and efficacy in patients who switch from patisiran -LNP to ALN -TTRSC02 treatment, and up to a 1 -year Follow -up Period after the last dose of study drug as shown in Figure 1. After the Screening period, and at the start of the Treatment Period, eligible patients will be randomized 3:1 on Day 1 to receive 25 mg of ALN -TTRSC02 administered as a subcutaneous (SC) inje ction once every 3 months (q3M) or patisiran -LNP administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion once every 3 weeks (q3w). During the 18 -month Treatment Period, patients will undergo assessments for efficacy and/or safety (as outlined in the Schedule of Asse ssments), with key efficacy assessments being performed prior to first dose, at Month 9 (primary efficacy analysis time -point) and at Month 18; samples for TTR assessment will be collected more frequently through out the 18 -month Treatment Period. During t he Treatment Extension Period, starting at Week 84/Month 19, all patients on the patisiran -LNP arm will switch to treatment with ALN -TTRSC02 (first dose) and remain on ALN -TTRSC02 q3M treatment for the remainder of the study . During the Treatment Extensio n Period, patients will undergo safety assessments quarterly and efficacy assessments every 9 month s at Month 27 and at Month 36. During the Follow -up Period , all patients on ALN -TTRSC02 will undergo safety assessments quarterly until serum TTR levels return to ≥80% of baseline (for up to 1 year after the last dose of study drug), or until the patient starts a TTR lowering regimen as a part of clinical care , whichever comes first; all patients will be followed for a minimum of 3 months. Female patients of child -bearing potential will be followed until serum TTR levels return to ≥80% of baseline. Patients who discontinue treatment early while on patisiran -LNP will undergo a follow -up visit 30 days afte r the last dose of study drug. The placebo arm of the APOLLO study will be used as an external control for the primary, most secondary, and most exploratory efficacy analyses . Primary and secondary efficacy evaluations will include mNIS+7, Norfolk QoL-DN questionnaire, 10 -MWT, mBMI, R -ODS questionnaire, percent TTR reduction, and the composite of all cause deaths and/or all cause hospitalizations. Study personnel performing the mNIS+7 component assessments will not reference the results of any previous assessments. Number of Planned Patients Approximately 160 patients are planned for enrollment in this study. To match the cardiac disease severity with the APOLLO study population, the study plans to enroll no more than 15% of patients with NT -proBNP values greater than 3000 ng/L at baseline."

Study Drug, Dose, and Mode of Administration ALN -TTRSC02 drug product is a subcutaneously (SC) administered N-acetyl galactos amine ligand (GalNAc )-conjugated small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting liver -expressed transthyretin (TTR) messenger RNA (mRNA). ALN -TTRSC02 will be administered as a 25 mg SC injection q3M (12 weeks) . Reference Treatment, Dose, and Mode of Administrati on Patisiran -LNP drug product is an intravenously (IV) administered siRNA targeting liver -expressed TTR mRNA formulated with lipid excipients (DLin -MC3 -DMA, DSPC, cholesterol, and PEG 2000-C-DMG) in isotonic phosphate buffered saline. Patisiran -LNP will be administered as a 0.3 mg/kg IV infusion once every 3 weeks (q3w ) ± 3 days . All patients will receive premedication prior to patisiran -LNP infusions as described further in the protocol. Duration of Treatment and Study The estimated time on stud y for each patient is approximately 3 years, inclusive of 42 days of Screening, and up to 36 months of open -label treatment (including the 18 -month Treatment Period plus an 18-month Treatment Extension Period). During the Follow -up Period, all patients on ALN -TTRSC02 will undergo safety assessments quarterly until serum TTR levels return to ≥80% of baseline (for up to 1 year after the last dose of study drug), or until the patient starts a TTR lowering regimen as a part of clinical care, whichever comes fir st; all patients will be followed for a minimum of 3 months. Female patients of child -bearing potential who discontinue ALN -TTRSC02 will be followed until serum TTR levels return to ≥80% of baseline. Statistical Methods A full statistical analysis plan (S AP) will be finalized prior to first patient dosed . The co -primary endpoints are change s from baseline at Month 9 for mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DN total scores. The co -primary endpoints will each be tested at a significance level of 0.05 and both must be significant to declare a positive trial. The primary comparison will be conducted at Month 9 and additional analyses will be performed at Month 18. For the co -primary endpoint mNIS+7, change in mNIS+7 from baseline at Month 9 will be compared between the A LN-TTRSC02 group in this study and the placebo group in the APOLLO study. The treatment effect will be estimated based on the least -square (LS) means using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline mNIS+7 score as a covariate and factors inclu ding treatment group (ALN -TTRSC02 vs placebo), genotype (V30M vs non -V30M) , and age of disease onset (<50 vs ≥50 years old). The other co -primary endpoint Norfolk QoL-DN, change in Norfolk QoL-DN total score from baseline at Month 9 will be comp ared betwee n the ALN -TTRSC02 group in this study and the placebo group in the APOLLO study. The treatment effect will be estimated based on the least -square (LS) means using an"

The co -primary endpoints for the patisiran -LNP group in this study will be summarized descriptive ly. Secondary clinical efficacy endpoints will be analyzed similarly. Overall type I error control for secondary endpoints will be achieved by a hierarchical testing procedure. The TTR percent reduction through Month 9 will be derived as the average tro ugh TTR percent reduction from Month 6 to 9 which is the steady state period for both ALN -TTRSC02 and patisiran -LNP. A Hodges -Lehmann method stratified by previous TTR stabilizer use (yes vs no) will be used to estimate the 95% confidence interval ( CI) for the median difference between the ALN -TTRSC02 and patisiran - LNP groups in this study. Non -inferiority will be declared if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the treatment difference is greater than –10%. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted to compare the TTR percent reduction between the ALN -TTRSC02 group from this study and the pooled patisiran -LNP groups from this Phase 3 study and the APOLLO study. The composite endpoint of all -cause hospitalization and death events over 18 months will be analyzed using recurrent event method Andersen -Gill model with treatment group (ALN -TTRSC02 vs placebo) as an independent variable. The endpoint will be analyzed for both the overall population and in patients with cardiac involvement. The analysis of exploratory efficacy endpoint will be described in the SAP. Safety data will be summarized descriptively."

Disease Overview Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) is a rare, life -threatening, autosomal dominant, multi -systemic disease caused by mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) gene that results in rapidly progressive, debilitating morbidity and high mortality. The cardinal manifestations of hATTR amyloidosis are polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. TTR, also kn own as prealbumin, is a tetrameric protein predominantly produced by hepatocytes (>95% of circulating TTR is liver -derived), with a smaller fraction produced by the choroid plexus and retina (Liz, Mar et al. 2010 ). The primary physiological role of TTR is to serve as a carrier of retinol (also known as vitamin A), which involves TTR binding to the retinol binding protein (RBP): vitamin A complex. TTR also serves as a minor carrier for thyroxine (T4). In hATTR amy loidosis, inherited mutations in the TTR gene lead to destabilization of the tetrameric protein and disassociation of the TTR subunits into dimers and individual mutant and wild-type ( wt) monomers, which subsequently misfold. These misfolded TTR monomers can then self -assemble into oligomers and form amyloid fibrils and plaques in the extracellular space of various tissues (Hou, Aguilar et al. 2007 ), including the peripheral nervous system, heart, gastrointestinal tract, kidney, central nervous system and ey e, leading to cellular injury and organ dysfunction with corresponding clinical manifestations. Since almost all patients are heterozygous for the mutated TTR allele, the amyloid fibrils typically consist of both mutant and wt TTR. There are over 120 repo rted TTR genetic mutations associated with hATTR (Connors, Lim et al. 2003 ; Ando, Coelho et al. 2013 ). The disease is most often caused by the valine to methionine mutation at position 30 in the human TTR gene (V30M )primarily in families with heritage from Portugal, Sweden, Japan , and Brazil (Parman, Adams et al. 2016 ). Another common genotype is the isoleucine substitution for valine at position 122 (V122I). This mutation occurs in up to 4% of African American s and in over 5% of West African populations (Jacobson, Pastore et al. 1997 ). Historically, due to incomplete understanding of etiology and pathogenesis, 2 clinical syndromes of hATTR amyloidosis have been described in the medical literature: hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (previously known as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, or FAP) and hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (previously known as familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy, or FAC), both of which are characterized by amyloid depos its comprised of both mutant and wt TTR (Yazaki, Tokuda et al. 2000 ). However, while patients with hATTR amyloidosis may present with predominantly polyneuropathy or cardiomyopathy, most patients with hATTR amyloidosis manifest signs and symptoms of both polyneuropat hy and cardiomyopathy over the course of their disease. Therefore, hATTR amyloidosis is increasingly viewed as a single hereditary disease with a spectrum of clinical manifestations rather than 2 distinct syndromes (Swiecicki, Zhen et al. 2015 ). The clinical manifestations of the length -dependent, symmetrical polyneuropathy are the result of amyloid -mediated injury to large and small peripheral nerve fibers (Benson and Kincaid 2007 ; Plante -Bordeneuve and Said 2011 ; Ando, Coelho et al. 2013 ). Sensory abnormalities include painful dysesthesias in the feet and hands, as well as loss of sensation leading to thermal burns in these areas and to joint injury in the lower limbs. Progressive muscle atrophy and motor"
33,page_33,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 Original, 11 October 2018 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 33 weakness in both lower and upper limbs leads to impaired ambulation (progressing from the use of one stick to two for ambulation, followed by needing to use a wheel chair and then becoming bed-ridden over just a few years), and inability to perform other activities of daily living. Autonomic dysfunction result s in debilitating orthostatic hypotension, severe gastrointestinal symptoms, and bladder dysfunction with recurrent urinary tract infections. Polyneuropathy stage or severity is classified by FAP stage or Polyneuropathy Disability (PND) score, both of wh ich are based on ambulatory ability. The degree of neurologic impairment has historically been measured using the Neurologic Impairment Score (NIS), which has been s hown to be correlated with FAP s tage and PND score; an increase from baseline in NIS score signifies worsening in neurologic impairment, which in turn correlates with a higher FAP stage designation and PND score (Adams, Coelho et al. 2015 ). The maximum impairment score for the NIS is 244 points, and a change from baseline of 10 to 14 points per year has been observed in untreated patients based on data from an hATTR amyloidosis clinical study and an observational natural history study (Berk, Suhr et al. 2013 ; Adams, Coelho et al. 2015 ). This is in contrast to patients with diabetic polyneuropathy where NIS progression is <1 point/year (Ziegler, Low et al. 2011 ). For clinical studies, the modified NIS+7 (mNIS+7) score, a more sensitive measure with a scale from 0 to 304 poi nts, has been developed to provide a more comprehensive measure of polyneuropathy in patients with hATTR amyloidosis (Suanprasert, Berk et al. 2014 ). Cardiac infiltration with amyloid leads to heart wall thickening and cardiomyopathy characterized by clinical heart failure due to both diastolic and systolic dysfunction, as well as cardiac conduction disturbances and arrhythmias (Carvalho, Alves et al. 1992 ; Connors, Yamashita et al. 2004 ; Soares, Coelho et al. 2005 ; Benson and Kincaid 2007 ; Ando, Coelho et al. 2013 ). Patients with symptomatic heart failure experience rapi d progression of their amyloid cardiomyopathy, with substantial worsening of echocardiographic and biomarker measures of cardiac function, ambulation, and quality of life seen over a period of 18 months or less (Ruberg and Berk 2012 ). 1.2. Current Treatments The treatment of hATTR amyloidosis requires a multidisciplinary approach primarily involving neurology, gastroenterology, and cardiology specialties. Palliative/symptomatic t herapies directed at specific symptoms such as pain, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea have been the mainstay of treatment. Two treatment approaches that have historically been used for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis are orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLT), which serves to eliminate mutant TTR from the circulation, but does not affect the hepatic production of wt TTR (Okamoto, Wixner et al. 2009 ; Carvalho, Rocha et al. 2015 ; Ericzon, Wilczek et al. 2015 ), and TTR tetramer stabilizers (including tafamidis and diflunisal), which have been shown in clinical studies to reduce neuropathy in patients with early stage polyneuropathy (Coelho, Maia et al. 2012 ; Berk, Suhr et al. 2013 ). However, these therapies are restricted to a small subset of patients with hATTR amyloidosis with early stage neuropathy. Furthermore, the majority of patients receiving tafamidis con tinue to experience neuropathy progression with a steady decline in quality of life, ability to walk , and to perform activities of daily living (Barroso, Jud ge et al. 2017 )."
34,page_34,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 Original, 11 October 2018 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 34 Recently, the antisense oligonucleotide inotersen and the short interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) patisiran -LNP were shown in randomized controlled studies to significantly reduce neurologic impairment and improve quality of life co mpared with placebo in patients with hATTR amyloidosis (Adams, Suhr et al. 2017 ; Dyck PJ 2017 ; Wang et al. 2017 ). Both novel therapies, albeit through different mechanisms, aim at reducing the expression of TTR mess enger RNA (mRNA), and the amount of circulating amyloidogenic protein in patients with hATTR amyloidosis. 1.3. RNAi Therapeutics to Reduce TTR Levels Patisiran -LNP (ONPATTRO™) developed by Alnylam, which targets the production of hepatic TTR, is approved in the US for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults and in the EU for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis in adult patients with stage 1 and stage 2 polyneuropathy. The recommended dose of patisiran -LNP is 0.3 mg/kg administered v ia intravenous (IV) infusion once every 3 weeks (q3w). To minimize the risk of infusion related reactions (IRRs) , all patients must receive pre -medication including corticosteroids (10 mg dexamethasone IV), histamine 1 (H1) and histamine 2 (H2) blockers, and paracetamol or equivalents 60 minutes prior to the infusion. Patisiran -LNP utilizes the mechanism of RNA interference to selectively degrade TTR mRNA and thereby reduce the expression of its corresponding protein (Bumcrot, Manoharan et al. 2006 ). Patisiran -LNP is an siRNA that is formulated as lipid nanoparticles (LNP) to target delivery to hepatocyt es in the liver, the primary source of TTR protein in circulation. Following IV infusion, opsonization of the LNP by apolipoprotein E facilitates binding to the low -density lipoprotein receptor on hepatocytes and subsequent endocytosis. Fusion of the ion izable lipid component of the LNP with the endosomal membrane then leads to release of the siRNA into the cytoplasm where it can bind to and activate the RNA -induced silencing complex (RISC). Upon binding and activation of RISC in the cytoplasm within hepa tocytes, the siRNA duplex unwinds and the antisense strand specifically binds to a genetically conserved sequence in the 3’ untranslated region of wt and mutant TTR mRNA. The Argonaute -2 endonuclease within the RISC/siRNA enzyme complex catalytically degr ades wt and mutant TTR mRNA, resulting in a reduction of wt and mutant TTR protein. Alnylam had also developed another siRNA -conjugate therapeutic, revusiran, primarily for the treatment of patients with hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy; however, th is program was discontinued as described further in the ALN -TTRSC02 Investigator’s Brochure ( IB). ALN -TTRSC02 is in clinical development for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis. This molecule is designed to have greater potency and prolonged duration of ac tion compared to current and previous siRNAs evaluated in the clinic for treatment of this disease. ALN - TTRSC02 has the same nucleotide sequence as revusiran but employs a different ratio of chemical modifications to confer increased stability of the siRN A. ALN -TTRSC02 drug product comprises the drug substance ALN -65492, an siRNA targeting TTR mRNA that is conjugated to an N -acetyl galactosamine ligand (GalNAc) to facilitate delivery to the liver, formulated in 10 mM sodium phosphate, 110 mM sodium chlor ide at pH 7 for subcutaneous (SC) injection. Uptake of ALN -TTRSC02 occurs via the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), a member of the C -type lectin family of receptors that recognizes and binds"
35,page_35,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 Original, 11 October 2018 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 35 glycoproteins with terminal galactose (Gal) or GalNAc residu es (Ashwell and Morell 1974 ; Nair, Willoughby et al. 2014 ). It is expr essed on the cell surface of hepatocytes at a high copy number (0.5-1 million per cell) (Baenziger and Fiete 1980 ; Schwartz, Rup et al. 1980 ), and facilitates clearance of desialylated glycoproteins from the blood (Geffen and Spiess 1992 ). Binding of the carbohydrate ligan d to the ASGPR leads to receptor -mediated endocytosis of the ligand -receptor complex followed by release of its cargo in the endocytic pathway, and subsequent recycling of the receptor to the cell surface for successive rounds of uptake. ALN -TTRSC02 has be en shown to have increased potency and duration of TTR reduction in nonclinical species and in a clinical study in healthy volunteers described in Section 1.4.2 , enabling a much lower dose, lower injection volume , and significantly less frequent dosing for patients compared to other TTR -lowering drugs. 1.4. Clinical Experience with Patisiran -LNP and ALN -TTRSC02 1.4.1. The APOLLO Study The safety and efficacy of patisiran -LNP was shown in a Phase 3 multicenter, multinational, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study (ALN -TTR02 -004, APOLLO) that met the primary and all secondary endpoints (Adams, Gonzalez -Duarte et al. 2018 ). This study demonstrated that in patients with hATTR amyloidosis, who exhibited a broad range of disease severity and TTR genotypes, treatment with patisiran -LNP leads to a significant improvement in neuropathy (mNIS+7) relative to placebo at 18 months (primary analysis ), as well as significant improvement in quality of life (N orfolk QoL -DN, key secondary analysis ) relative to placebo at 18 months . Significant improvement in neuropathy and quality of life were also observed at Month 9. This study furthermore demonstrated that treatment with patis iran-LNP is associated with an improvement in overall health (gait speed, nutritional status, and disability), with improvement in these endpoints seen as early as at Month 9. Patisiran -LNP treatment was also associated with improvement compared to placeb o in exploratory cardiac endpoints including key echocardiographic parameters and the biomarker NT -proBNP (Solomon 2018 ). In post -hoc analyses, patisiran -LNP demonstrated a reduction in the composite event rate of hospitalization and mortality. In the patisiran -LNP group , the mean TTR percent reduction from baseline was 82.6% and 84.3% at Month 9 and Month 18, respectivel y. TTR percent reduction was maintained over the duration of the study. A correlation (Pearson’s r, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.49 -0.68) was observed between the degree of TTR reduction from baseline and the change in the mNIS+7 at 18 months. Patisiran -LNP showed an acceptable safety profile in the APOLLO study. Common adverse events ( AEs) occurring more frequently with patisiran -LNP compared to placebo included peripheral edema (30% versus 22%) and infusion related reactions (IRRs) (19% versus 9%, respectively). 1.4.2. ALN-TTRSC02 -001 Phase 1 Clinical Study ALN -TTRSC02 has been evaluated in a recently completed Phase 1 study (study ALN - TTRSC02 -001). ALN -TTRSC02 -001 was a randomized, single -blind, placebo controlled single - ascending dose study to evaluate the safety and t olerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ALN -TTRSC02 in healthy subjects and in healthy subjects of"

Single doses of 5, 25, 50, 100, 200 or 300 mg ALN -TTRSC02 were administered by SC injection to cohorts of 8 subjec ts (6:2 ratio ALN -TTRSC02 to placebo). Subjects remained blinded to treatment assignment through Day 90. Eighty healthy volunteers were randomized in 10 cohorts and followed for up to 314 days. ALN -TTRSC02 reduced serum TTR in a dose dependent fashion wit h higher doses of ALN - TTRSC02 achieving deeper and longer duration of serum TTR reduction. At the proposed dose of 25 mg ALN -TTRSC02, a single dose resulted in maximum TTR reduction of 94% and mean maximum TTR reduction of 83% that was maintained for 90 d ays (n=12). Consistent with the expected PD effect, vitamin A levels were also reduced following a single dose of ALN - TTRSC02. Similar PD effects were observed in the subjects of Japanese descent, as compared to the subjects in the non -Japanese cohorts. AEs were reported in 77% and 50% of ALN -TTRSC02 and placebo treated subjects, respectively. Among ALN -TTRSC02 treated patients, the majority of AEs were mild. ALN - TTRSC02 drug -related AEs included injection site reactions in 4 subjects that were mild and transient including bruising (50 mg), erythema (200 mg) and pain (200 mg and 300 mg); there were no drug -related AEs in patients receiving ALN -TTRSC02 doses ≤25 mg. There were no severe or serious AEs; no subject discontinued from the study due to an AE. A dose-dependent pattern in transaminase elevations was observed across the ALN -TTRSC02 doses tested, in particular at doses ≥100 mg ; the majority were mild, transient, and none were reported as AEs. Most alanine transaminase ( ALT ) and aspartate transamina se (AST ) elevations were ≤3 x upper limit of normal ( ULN ); 1 subject receiving ALN -TTRSC02 50 mg had AST >3 x ULN and 1 subject receiving ALN -TTRSC02 200 mg had ALT and AST >3 x ULN, which were asymptomatic and resolved to <ULN without intervention. There were no concurrent elevations in bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase. There were no clinically significant changes in renal function or hematologic parameters, including platelets and no clinically significant changes in electrocardiogram ( ECG ), vital signs or physical exam. Further information on the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of ALN -TTRSC02 is provided in the current edition of the Investigator’s Brochure. 1.5. Study Design Rationale This is a global Phase 3 open -label study designed to evalu ate the efficacy, safety, and PK/PD profile of ALN -TTRSC02 in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis. Patients will be randomized 3:1 to ALN -TTRSC02 or patisiran -LNP. Patisiran -LNP is the reference comparator arm. All patients randomized to patisiran -LNP will be transitioned to ALN -TTRSC02 after completion of the 18 -month Treatment Period. The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 42 days, an 18 -month Treatment Period, a n 18-month Treatment Extension Period, and up to a 1 -year Follow -up Period after the last dose of study. The proposed development plan for ALN -TTRSC02 builds upon learnings from the previous development of another siRNA that targets TTR, patisiran -LNP (descr ibed in Section 1.4). The completed patisiran -LNP Phase 3 APOLLO study, which enrolled a similar patient population to the current study and incorpor ated similar endpoints to the current study, will be used as an external control for efficacy analysis. The co -primary endpoints in this study, change from"
37,page_37,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 Original, 11 October 2018 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 37 baseline in mNIS+7 score and N orfolk QoL -DN total score at Month 9, will be compared with the placeb o group from the APOLLO study at Month 9 as the primary analysis. An additional analysis of efficacy is planned at Month 18. The use of an external control for comparison is supported by the principles outlined in the EMA guideline on clinical trials in small populations (CHMP/EWP/83561/2005), ICH E10 guidance on control groups in clinical trials, as well as the USA's 21st Century Cures Act (Section 3012 Targeted Drugs for Rare Diseases). Based on these guidelines , an external comparison is an appropria te clinical study design for diseases occurring in small populations, with well understood natural history of disease course. The natural history of hATTR amyloidosis has been well -characterized in several, large, randomized clinical trials, including the APOLLO study, as well as natural history studies. Importantly, these studies all demonstrate similar rates of disease progression despite having been conducted at substantially different points in time and in patients with different disease characteristi cs across different geographies (Berk, Suhr et al. 2013 ; Adams, Coelho et al. 2015 ; Maurer, Elliott et al. 2017 ; Adams, Gonzalez -Duarte et al. 2018 ). The patisiran -LNP reference comparator arm will help to validate the use of the external control for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses both by allowing d escriptive comparison of the clinical efficacy endpoints between treatment arms within this study and by establishing similar (non -inferior) level of TTR reduction is achieved for ALN -TTRSC02 and patisiran -LNP. Secondary and exploratory endpoints in this s tudy assessing the clinical manifestations of hATTR amyloidosis are similar to those in the APOLLO study. A composite of all -cause death and/or all -cause hospitalizations has also been included to assess the impact of ALN -TTRSC02 on patient outcomes in th e overall study population and in patients with cardiac involvement. Additional cardiac assessments are included in this study as exploratory endpoints. These endpoints will all be assessed in comparison to the placebo group in the APOLLO study. Safety wi ll be assessed by monitoring of AEs, laboratory data including liver function tests, changes in physical exam, vital signs, and ECG. Safety data will not be compared to the APOLLO study. 1.6. Dose Rationale The proposed dose of ALN -TTRSC02 for this study is 25 mg SC given q3M. This dose was well-tolerated in the Phase 1 study (see Section 1.4.2 ) and is expected to provide efficacy similar to patisiran -LNP based on the anticipated magnitude of TTR lowering. Modeling and simulation predict that the proposed 25 mg dose of ALN -TTRSC02 administered SC q3M will lead to substantial and persistent serum TTR reduction, comparable to TTR lowering observed with patisiran -LNP in the Phase 3 APOLLO study. At steady state, which is achieved by approximately 6 months, 25 mg SC q3M regimen of ALN -TTRSC02 is predicted to achieve median trough TTR reductions of 86%, which is similar to patisiran -LNP. This magnitude of T TR lowering is expected to lead to durable clinical benefit as evidenced by the statistically significant difference in mNIS+7 and all the secondary endpoints, including N orfolk QoL-DN, in the patisiran -LNP arm compared to placebo in the pivotal Phase 3 AP OLLO study. Furthermore, on the Phase 3 APOLLO study, this magnitude of TTR lowering was associated with an acceptable safety profile."
38,page_38,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 Original, 11 October 2018 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 38 Overall, available nonclinical and clinical data suggest the selected dose will appropriately balance safety and efficacy in the broad hATTR patient population. 1.7. Benefit -Risk Assessment Based on available nonclinical and clinical data, with evidence of T TR reduction in the healthy subject study , TTR reduction by ALN -TTRSC02 is anticipated to beneficially impact disease progression in patients with hATTR amyloidosis, as has been shown with other available TTR lowering agents including patisiran -LNP and ino tersen. The q3M SC regimen is infrequent, easy to administer, and does not require premedication, and thus may maximize convenience and minimize overall burden of care. In the Phase 1 clinical study in healthy subjects, single SC doses up to the highest tested dose (300 mg) of ALN -TTRSC02 were well tolerated. Given the biological target of ALN -TTRSC02, the available nonclinical and clinical data, and the mode of administration, important potential risks for ALN -TTRSC02 are injection site reactions (ISR s), liver function test (LFT) abnormalities, and consequences of vitamin A deficiency. During the study, patients will be closely monitored, including evaluation of injections sites. As ALN -TTRSC02 is targeted for delivery to the liver, there is a potent ial for development of LFT abnormalities. Patients presenting with any laboratory result considered unacceptable as per exclusion criteria (see Section 4) at time of enrollment will be excluded from participation in this study, and LFTs will be routinely monitored throughout the study per the Schedule of Assessments. Criteria for dose withholding, modification and stopping ALN - TTRSC02 dosing due to LFT abnormalities are provided in Section 5.2.3 . Detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks of ALN -TTRSC02 and additional safety information may be found in the current edition of the ALN -TTRSC02 Investigator’s Brochure. For patisiran -LNP, important identified risks include infusion related reactions ( IRRs ). All patients must receive premedication with a corticosteroid, para cetamol/acetaminophen, and H1 and H2 blockers prior to patisiran -LNP administration to reduce the risk of IRRs (see Section 5.2.2.2 ). Potential risk s include consequences of vitamin A deficiency and severe hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylaxis) to the active substance or any of the excipients. Detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks of patisiran -LNP and additional safety infor mation may be found in the current edition of the patisiran -LNP Investigator’s Brochure or, where approved, in the ONPATTRO prescribing/product information. Nonclinical and clinical data with ALN -TTRSC02 and patisiran -LNP have shown that the lowering of ci rculating vitamin A associated with the reduction in TTR (a carrier of retinol) does not result in severe vitamin A deficiency; transport and tissue uptake of vitamin A can occur through alternative mechanisms in the absence of retinol binding protein. Ho wever, as the vitamin A content of the diet may vary between different individuals, all patients will be instructed to take the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A while on the study (see Section 5.2). Laboratory tests for serum vitamin A do not reflect the total amount of vitamin A in the body and should not be used to guide vitamin A supplementation beyond the recommended daily dose du ring treatment with ALN -TTRSC02 and patisiran -LNP."

Summary of Study Design This is a global Phase 3 randomized, open -label study designed to evaluate efficacy, safety, and PK/PD of ALN -TTRSC02 in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis. Patients will be randomized 3:1 to ALN -TTRSC02 or patisiran -LNP, a reference comparator . The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 42 days, an 18 -month Treatment Period, a n 18-month Treatment Extension Period which will include collection of safety and efficacy in patients who switch from patisiran -LNP to ALN -TTRSC02 treatment, and up to a 1 -year Follow - up Period after the last dose of study as shown in Figure 1. After the Screening period at the start of the Treatment Period, eligible patien ts will be randomized 3:1 on Day 1 to receive 25 mg of ALN -TTRSC02 administered as a SC injection on q3M or patisiran -LNP administered as an IV infusion q3w; patients in the patisiran -LNP arm will also receive premedications prior to each dose (see Section 5.2.2.2 ). During the 18 -month Treatment Period, patients will undergo assessments for efficacy and/or safety (as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments), with key efficacy assessments being performed prior to first dose, at Month 9 (primary efficacy analysis time -point) and at Month 18; samples for TTR assessment will be collected more frequently throughout the 18-month Treatment Period. All ALN -TTRSC02 doses will be administered at the clinic during scheduled study assessment visits through Month 18. For patients randomized to the ALN -TTRSC02 arm, after Month 9, non- dosing vi sits for routine assessments (eg, vital signs and blood collecti on) may be performed outside the clinic (eg, at home) by a trained health care professional where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow. All patisiran -LNP doses will be administered at the clinic during the scheduled study asse ssment visits through Month 9. After Month 9, visits for patisiran -LNP dosing, as well as routine assessments (eg, vital signs and blood collection), may be performed outside of the clinic (eg, at home) by a trained healthcare professional where applicabl e country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, with the exception of the patisiran -LNP dosing visits at Weeks 48, 60 and 72 which must be performed in the clinic. For both ALN -TTRSC02 and patisiran -LNP treated patients, wherever possible, AE col lection associated with visits performed outside of the clinic will be collected by a phone call from qualified site staff. In addition, ad hoc visits may be performed outside the clinic (eg, at home) throughout the study in cases where, for example, a bl ood sample needs to be redrawn. In all cases , the Month 9 and Month 18 efficacy visits will be performed in the clinic. Further details with regard to visits performed outside of the clinic are provided in the Study Reference Manual. During the Treatment Extension Period, starting at Week 84/Month 19 , patients who are tolerating their ALN -TTRSC02 injections as determined by the Investigator and where applicable country and local regulations allow, may have ALN -TTRSC02 administered outs ide the clinic (eg, home) by a healthcare professional trained on study drug administration. Also , starting at Week 84/Month 19, all patients on the patisiran -LNP arm will switch to treatment with ALN -TTRSC02 (first dose) and remain on ALN -TTRSC02 q3M trea tment for the remainder of the study.

During the Treatment Extension Period, patients will undergo safety assessments quarterly and efficacy assessments every 9 months at Month 27 and at Month 36. During the Follow -up Period, all patients on A LN-TTRSC02 will undergo safety assessments quarterly until serum TTR levels return to ≥80% of baseline (for up to 1 year after the last dose of study drug), or until the patient starts a TTR lowering regimen as a part of clinical care, whichever comes firs t; all patients will be followed for a minimum of 3 months. Female patients of child - bearing potential will be followed until serum TTR levels return to ≥80% of baseline. Patients who discontinue treatment early while on patisiran -LNP will undergo a foll ow-up visit 30 days after the last dose of study drug. The placebo arm of the APOLLO study will be used as an external control for the primary, most secondary, and most exploratory efficacy analysis. Primary and secondary efficacy evaluations will includ e mNIS+7, N orfolk QoL-DN questionnaire, 10 -MWT, mBMI, R -ODS questionnaire, percent TTR reduction, and the composite of all -cause deaths and/or all -cause hospitalizations. Study personnel performing the mNIS+7 component assessments will not reference the results of any previous assessments. 3.2. Duration of Treatment The treatment duration in this study is up to 3 6 months inclusive of the 18 -month Treatment Period and the 1 8-month Treatment Extension Period. Refer to Section 4.3.1 for information on early treatment discontinuation. 3.3. Duration of Study The estimated time on study for each patient is approximately 3 years, inclusive of 42 days of Screening, a nd up to 36 months of open -label treatment (including the 18 -month Treatment Period plus the 18-month Treatment Extension Period). The Follow -up Period is until serum TTR levels return to ≥80% of baseline (for up to 1 year after the last dose of study drug ), or until the patient starts a TTR lowering regimen as a part of clinical care, whichever comes first; all patients will be followed for a minimum of 3 months.

Number of Planned Patients Approximately 160 patients are planned for enrollment in this study. To match the cardiac disease severity with the APOLLO study population, the study plans to enroll no more than 1 5% of patients with NT -proBNP values greater than 3000 ng/L at baseline. 3.5. Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups Using the Interactive Response System (IRS), patients will be randomized 3:1 to the ALN - TTRSC02 or patisiran -LNP arm. Randomization will be stratified by TTR genotype (V30M vs. non-V30M) and baseline NIS score (<50 vs ≥50). Each patient will be uniquely identified in the study by a combination of the site number and patient identification number. Upon signing the informed consent form (ICF), the patient will be assigned a patient identification number by t he IRS. The Investigator or his/her designee will contact the IRS to randomize the patient after confirming that the patient fulfills all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. 3.6. Blinding Not applicable, this is an open -label, controlled study. 3.7. Data Monitoring Committee An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will oversee the safety and overall conduct of this study through the Treatment Period (through Month 18), providing input to the Sponsor. The DMC will operate under the rules of a charter that will be reviewed and approved at the organizational meeting of the DMC. The DMC has the responsibility for reviewing safety data and analyses and making recommendations to the Sponsor. The DMC will perform periodic reviews of data duri ng the course of the clinical trial through the Treatment Period, and on an ad hoc basis for review of emergent safety data. Details are provided in the DMC Charter. 3.8. Adjudication Committee An independent Adjudication Committee will review deaths and hospi talizations and will attribute a cause according to the responsible underlying disease process rather than the immediate mechanism. Deaths and hospitalizations will be classified as specified in the Adjudication Committee Charter. 4.

47,page_47,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 Original, 11 October 2018 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 47 If this occurs, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient the appropriate processes for discontinuation from study drug and must discuss with the subject the options for continuation of the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3), including different options for follow -up and collection of data (eg, in person, by phone, by mail, through family or friends, or from options not involving patient contact, such as communication with other treating physicians, or from review of medical records), including endpoints and adverse events, and must document this decision in the patient’s medical records. If a patient discontinues dosing due to an AE, including serious adverse events ( SAEs ), the event should be followed as described i n Section 6.5.7. When a patient discontinues study drug dosing, the primary reason must be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Patien ts who discontinue study drug and remain on study may receive treatment consistent with local standard practice for their disease per Investigator judgement, as applicable. Patients who discontinue study drug early for any reason during the Treatment Perio d (defined as the time the first dose of study drug is administered on Study Day 1 through completion of the Month -18 assessments) should complete the Early Drug Discontinuation visit and will be encouraged to remain on the study to complete the modified M onth 9 and Month 18 efficacy assessments visits, prioritizing the primary and secondary assessments, where possible so that their experience is captured in the final analyses. If a patient discontinues study drug and completes the Early Drug Discontinuatio n visit within 3 months of Month 9 or Month 18 and remains on the study , they will not be required to complete the modified Efficacy Assessments at Month 9 and/or Month 18, as applicable depending on the time they discontinue study drug (Table 3). Patients who discontinue study drug, but who remain on study, may receive treatment consistent with local standard practice for their disease per Investigator judgment, as applicable. For patients who discontinue study drug and remain in the study, all AEs will be collected for 90 days after the last dose, thereafter, SAEs and AEs of clinical interest (see definition in Section 6.5.7.1 ) will be collected for the remainder of their participation in the study. Patients who discontinue study drug during the Treatment Extension period will be asked to return for their next scheduled visit to complete the Early Drug Discontinuation visit. All patients who discontinue study drug will also be asked to complete safety follow -up visits, per the Follow -up Period schedule (see Table 3) until serum TTR levels return to ≥80% of baseline (for up to 1 year after the last dose of study drug), or until the patient starts a TTR lowering regimen as a part of clinical care, whichev er comes first; all patients will be followed for a minimum of 3 months. Female patients of child -bearing potential who discontinue ALN - TTRSC02 will be followed until serum TTR levels return to ≥80% of baseline. 4.3.2. Stopping a Patient’s Study Participation 4.3.2.1. Patient or Legal Guardian Stops Participation in the Study A patient or their legal guardian may stop participation in the study at any time. Patients considering stopping their participation in the study should be informed that they can discontinue study dr ug and/or decline procedural assessments and remain in the study for the collection of important study data as described in Section 4.3.1 . If a patie nt still chooses to discontinue study"

If the patient does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient appropriate procedures for stopping participation in the study. Data collected from the patient can continue to be used. In addition, in the countries where the collection and processing of the patient data is based on the patient ’s consent, if a patient withdraws consent to collect and process his/her data (see Section 4.3.2.2 ), as applicable, patient data up to the withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis of the study. In addition, where permitted, publicly available data (such as appropriate nation al or regional vital status registry or other relevant databases) can be included after withdrawal of consent, where available and allowable by local law. 4.3.2.2. Withdrawal of Consent to Process the Patient’s Personal Data Where allowed by local law, the patient may decide to withdraw consent to collect, store, use biological samples and as applicable, other personal data, informing the study doctor at any time in writing or in any other form that may be locally required. The Sponsor will continue to keep and use the patient’s study information (including any data resulting from the analysis of the patient’s biological samples until the time of withdrawal) according to applicable law. The process for the storage and, as applicable, further use of remaining samples will be followed per local requirements. 4.3.2.3. Investigator or Sponsor Stops Participation of a Patient in the Study The Investigator or Sponsor may stop the participation of a patient in the study at any time if this is considered to be in the patient’s best in terest. However, study integrity and interpretation are best maintained if all enrolled patients continue study assessments and follow -up even if study drug is discontinued. Termination of the clinical study and site closure are described in Section 8.1.6 . 4.3.2.4. Recording Reason for Stopping a Patient’s Study Participation The primary reason that a patient’s study participation is stopped must be recorded in the appropriate section of the eCRF and all efforts will be made to complete and report the observations as thoroughly as possible. If a patient’s study participation is stopped due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section 6.5.7 . 4.3.3. Lost to Follow -Up A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if the patient repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the clinical study center. The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:  The site must attempt to contact the patient and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the patient wishes to continue in the study and/or should continue in the study."
49,page_49,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 Original, 11 October 2018 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 49  Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or de signee must make every effort to regain contact with the patient (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the patient’s medical record.  Should the patient continue to be unreachable, the patient will be considered to have stopped participation in the study.  For patients who are lost to follow -up, the Investigator can search publicly available records (wher e permitted and allowed by local law) to ascertain survival status. This ensures that the outcome of the study is as comprehensive as possible. 4.3.4. Replacement of Study Patients Patients who discontinue the study drug or stop participation in the study will not be replaced. 5. TREATMENTS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS 5.1.

ALN -TTRSC02 ALN -TTRSC02 25 mg SC injection will be administered q3M (12 weeks ±3 days during the Treatment Period and ±7 days during the Treatment Extension Period ). Study drug SC injections will be administered under the supervision of the Investigator or healthcare professional. All ALN -TTRSC02 doses will be administered at the clinic during scheduled study assessment visits during the Treatment Period on Day 1 through Month 18. During the Treatment Extension Period, starting at Week 84/Month 19, patients who are tolerating their ALN -TTRSC02 injectio ns as determined by the Investigator and where applicable country and local regulations allow, may have ALN -TTRSC02 administered outside the clinic (eg, home) by a healthcare professional trained on study drug administration. Method of Administration of ALN -TTRSC02 ALN -TTRSC02 is for SC use and should be administered by a healthcare professional. The SC injection site may be marked and mapped for later observation. The preferred site of injection is the abdomen. Optional additional sites are the upper a rms and thighs. If a local reaction around the injection site occurs, photographs may be obtained. Additional details, including detailed instructions for study drug administration, can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. Missed Doses of ALN -TTRSC02 If a patient does not receive a dose of ALN -TTRSC02 within the specified dosing window, the Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor. After such consultation, the dose may be administered with up to a 6 -week delay (to be considered a delayed dose). The reafter , the dose will be considered missed and not administered. If a dose is administered with a delay, the next dose will resume following the original schedule. During the Treatment Period, every effort should be made to avoid missed doses of ALN -TTRS C02. During the Treatment Period, if a patients misses a dose, the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, will discuss whether the patient will be able to continue in the study (see also Section 4.3). 5.2.2.2. Patisiran -LNP Patisiran -LNP 0.3 mg/kg IV infusion will be administ ered once every 3 weeks (q3w) ± 3 days. The amount (in mg) of study drug to be administered should be determined base d on the patient's weight (kg). Dosing is based on actual body weight. For patients weighing ≥ 100 kg, the maximum recommended dose is 30 mg. All patisiran -LNP doses will be administered at the clinic during the scheduled study assessment visits through M onth 9. After Month 9, patisiran -LNP dosing may be performed at home by a trained healthcare professional where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, with the exception of the patisiran -LNP dosing visits at Weeks 48, 60 , and 7 2, which must be performed in the clinic during scheduled study assessment visits through Month 18.

51,page_51,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 Original, 11 October 2018 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 51 All patients should receive premedication prior to patisiran -LNP administration to reduce the r isk of infusion -related reactions (IRRs). Each of the following medicinal products should be given on the day of patisiran -LNP infusion at least 60 minutes prior to the start of infusion:  Intravenous corticosteroid (dexamethasone 10 mg, or equivalent)  Oral paracetamol (500 mg)  Intravenous H1 blocker (diphenhydramine 50 mg, or equivalent)  Intravenous H2 blocker (ranitidine 50 mg, or equivalent) For premedications not available or not tolerated intravenously, equivalents may be administered orally. Modifica tions to lower the corti costeroid dose may be made to the premedication regimen for either of the following 2 reasons:  If a patient is havin g difficulty tolerating the cor ticosteroid premedication regimen (e g, patient develops uncontrolled hyperglycemia, altered mental status, or other complication), then lowering of the corticosteroid premedication may be allowed for that patient after consultation with the medical monitor.  If a patient has tolerated 3 or more infusions of patisiran -LNP with their current corticosteroid premedication regimen (ie, patient has not had IRRs during the past 3 or more infusions ), then lowering of the corticosteroid premedication is recommended. Corticosteroid tapering should b e performed in the clinic. Steps to lower corticosteroid dosing are provided in the Pharmacy Manual. Additional or higher doses of one or more of the premedications may be administered to reduce the risk of IRRs, if needed. Guidelines for management of IRRs can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. Method of Administration of patisiran -LNP Patisiran -LNP is for IV use and should be administered by a healthcare professional. Weight from previous visit may be used for calculating dose. Weight must be collected predose. The patient’s infusion site should be assessed for signs of any localized reaction during the infusion and for 30 minutes after the end of the infusion. The patient will remain at the study site for 1 hour following completion of dosing for observation and completion of assessments. Detailed instructions for study drug preparation and administration can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. Missed Doses of patisiran -LNP If a patient does not re ceive a dose of patisiran -LNP within the dosing window (±3 days), the dose will be considered missed and not administered. A dose will be considered completed if 80% or more of the total volume of the IV solution has been administered to the patient. Pati ents will be permitted to miss an occasional dose of study drug. However, if a patient misses 2 consecutive doses, the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, will discuss whether the patient will be able to continue in the study."

Treatment Compliance Compliance with study drug admini stration will be verified through observation by study staff or trained home healthcare professionals . 5.5. Other Requirements 5.5.1. Contraception Females of child -bearing potential must be willing to use acceptable methods of contraception from 14 days before first ALN -TTRSC02 dose, throughout study participation, and for 90 days after last dose administration. Females of child -bearing potential t aking patisiran -LNP must use acceptable methods of contraception prior to dosing and for 12 weeks after the last dose of patisiran -LNP in this study if they do not switch and continue treatment with ALN -TTRSC02 starting at Day 337 (Week 48). Birth control methods which are considered highly effective include :  Placement of an intrauterine device.  Placement of an intrauterine hormone -releasing system.  Bilateral tubal occlusion.  Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post -vasectomy docum entation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient).  Established use of oral (except for low dose ge stagen s), implantable, injectable, or transderma l hormonal methods of contraception. Females of child -bearing potential who use hormonal contraceptives as a method of contraception must also use a barrier method (condom or occlusive cap [diaphragm or cervical/ vault cap] in conjunction with spermicide [e g, foam, gel, film, cream, or suppository]).  True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptab le methods of contraception. Abstinent patients must agree to use one of the above -mentioned contraceptive methods, if they start hetero sexual relationships during the study and for up to 90 days after the last dose of study drug. Investigators should adv ise females of childbearing potential of the most appropriate birth control method available within their country taking into account local medical practice. Females of child -bearing potential include female patients who have experienced menarche (or begin menarche over the course of the study ) and who are not postmenopausal or permanently sterilized (eg, bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy). A postmenopausal state is defined as the absence of menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause, confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone level within the postmenopausal range."
56,page_56,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 Original, 11 October 2018 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 56 For male patients, no contraception is required. However, contraception use by males should be consistent with local regulations as described in the corresponding patient informed consent forms. Compliance with contraception requirements will be assessed on a regular basis by the Investigator throughout the course of the study (see Section 6.5.6.2 ). 5.5.2. Alcohol Restrictions Patients will limit alcohol consumption throughout the course of the study. Alcohol is limited to no more than 2 units per day (unit: 1 glass of wine [approximately 125 mL] = 1 measure of spirits [approximately 1 fluid ounce] = ½ pint of beer [approximately 284 mL]) for the duration of the study. 6. STUDY ASSESSMENTS The schedule of study assessments is provided in Table 1 (Screening through Treatment Period Month 9), Table 2 (Treatment Period from Month 9 through Month 18) , Table 3 (Treatment Extension Period, Other Visits, and Follow -up Period), Table 4 (ALN -TTRSC02 PK Time Points) and Table 5 (Patisiran -LNP PK Time Points). Additional information on the collection of study assessments will be detailed in the Study Reference Manual. In this study there are 2 types of study centers :  Patient Care Sites (PCS) can screen, dose, and manage the well -being of patients and collect safety assessments, and can administer efficacy assessments that include, but are not limited to, completion of a questionnaire or collection of blood samples f or assessment of TTR and other PD biomarkers, as well as cardiac biomarkers, but will not perform the following efficacy assessments: NIS, mNIS+7, HRdb, 10 -MWT, FAP and PND, KPS, echocardiogram.  Central Assessment Sites (CAS) can perform all efficacy asse ssments and perform the same assessments as at a PCS (as stated above). Efficacy assessments (NIS, mNIS+7, HRdb, 10 -MWT, FAP and PND, KPS, echocardiogram) in this study may require special training as described further in Section 6.2; therefore, all patients must be sent to a CAS to collect these efficacy assessments during screening and p redose baseline assessments, Month 9, Month 18, and during the Treatment Extension period at Month 27 and Month 36. Assessors who will perform efficacy assessments at a CAS will be different from site personnel who monitor the administration of study drug during the study and monitor the well-being of the patient du ring the study. This is instituted to minimize the influence patient management and AEs may have on efficacy assessment evaluation(s). During the study, where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, assessments that may be condu cted by a qualified home healthcare professional include but are not limited to: blood draws, vital signs, physical exam, collection of information regarding hospitalizations, urgent care visits, procedures and concomitant medications. Wherever possible, AE collection associated with visits outside of the clinic will be collected by a phone call from qualified site staff. Further details with regard to visits performed outside of the clinic are provided in the Study Reference Manual."

Screening Assessments An informed consent form (ICF) or assent form that has been approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) must be signed by the patient (or legal guardian) before the Screening procedures are initiated. Al l patients (or their legal guardians) will be given a copy of the signed and dated ICF and/or assent form. See Table 1 for a list of Screening visit ass essments. Patients will complete the following 3 visit types prior to randomization: the informed consent form (ICF) will be obtained at the Visit 1 (Screening), and all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assessed except for the NIS and PND score crit eria; see Section 4.1); the NIS and PND score inclusion criteria will be assessed at Visit 2 (Baseline first assessment); other baseline assessments will be completed at Visit 3 or at Day 1 prior to first dose. V isits 1, 2 and 3 may each occur over multiple days. 6.1.1. Retesting If screening laboratory abnormalities, in the Investigator ’s judgement, are felt likely to be transient, then the laboratory tests may be repeated. The Investigator’s rationale should be docum ented. Laboratory values can be retested once during screening provided that the patient can be evaluated for eligibility and randomized within the allowed Screening period. Qualifying LFTs (AST, ALT and bilirubin) are an exception to this rule and may no t be repeated. 6.1.2. Rescreening For patients who do not meet LFT or NIS eligibility criteria, rescreening patients once may be permitted with consultation of the Medical Monitor after a minimum of 5 days have elapsed from a patient’s last screening assessment. 6.1.3. Demographic and Medical History/Disease History Medical history will be collected during screening V isit 1 (including any cardiac disorders, any eye disorders or previous ophthalmology test results, and prior medications). Documented technetium scintigrap hy and/or tissue biopsy testing for amyloidosis performed prior to study enrollment should be collected and recorded as part of medical history. Information on prior medications, hospitalization, and procedures through 1 year prior to first dose should be collected and recorded. At screening V isit 2 and V isit 3, only additional medical history changes since V isit 1 will be collected. Also, technetium scintigraphy scans and/or tissue biopsy testing for amyloidosis performed as part of clinical care during th e study should be collected and recorded as part of concomitant procedure information."

Vital Signs Vital signs will be measured as specified at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 3), and include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate. Vital signs will be measured predose, when applicable. When vital signs and blood sample collection occur at the same time, vital signs should be performed before blood samples are drawn, where possible. Vital signs should be measured predose in t he seated or supine position, after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes. Blood pressure should be taken using the same arm during a single visit . Body temperature in degrees Celsius will be obtained via oral, tympanic, or axillary methods. Heart rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and respiration rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute. Additional vital sign assessments, as medially indicated, may be added at the discret ion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice (as applicable). Vital signs results will be recorded in the eCRF. 6.5.2. Weight and Height Height will be measured in centimeters. Body weight will be measured in kilograms. Height and body weight measurements will be collected at the timepoints specified in in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 3) and will be recorded in the eCRF. For patients on the patisiran -LNP arm, weight must be collected prior to each dose. 6.5.3. Physical Examination Full and symptom -directed physical examinations will be conducted according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 3); if a physical examination is scheduled for a dosing visit, it should be conducted prior to dosing. Full physical examinations will include the examination of the following: general appear ance; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and dermatological systems; thyroid; lymph nodes; and neurological status. Symptom -directed physical examinations will be guided by evaluation of chang es in symptoms, or the onset of new symptoms, since the last visit. Clinically significant abnormalities observed during the physical examination are recorded on the medical history or AE eCRF. 6.5.4. Electrocardiogram A 12 -lead ECG reporting rhythm, ventricular rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval and Fridericia corrected QT interval (QTcF) will be obtained locally as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 3). Triplicate readings should be performed at Baseline and thereafter single readings can be performed. If the ECG machine does not calculate"

If the investigator performs an ECG over -read per standard of care, over -reads should be conducte d on each individual ECG performed. Patients should be supine for at least 5 minutes before each ECG is obtained. When ECG and blood sample collection occur at the same time, ECGs should be performed before blood samples are drawn. The Investigator or qualified designee will review all ECGs to assess whether the results have changed since baseline and to determine the clinical significance of the results. Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice. ECG recordings will be archived according to the Study Reference Manual. 6.5.5. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) The Columbia –Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) will be used to assess patient’s mental status as it relates to s uicidal ideation and behavior.

The C -SSRS will be performed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 3). 6.5.6. Clinical Laboratory Assessments Clinical laboratory assessments are listed in Table 7 will be collected as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 3) and should be evaluated by a central laboratory. Clinical l aboratory assessments may be collected at the clinical study center or outside the clinic (eg, home) by a trained healthcare professional. For the ALN -TTRSC02 arm, LFTs must be obtained within 28 days a nd reviewed by the investigator prior to each dose of ALN -TTRSC02. LFTs can be analyzed locally, but if a local assessment is drawn, a sample must also be drawn for analysis at the central laboratory. Specific instructions for transaminase elevations are provided in Section 5.2.3 . While local laboratory results may be used for urgent clinical and dosing decisions, on the day of the clinic visit assessments, all laboratory assessments specified in Table 7 which are performed at the clinic should also be sent in parallel to the central laboratory. In the case of discrepant local and central labor atory results on samples drawn on the same day, central laboratory results will be relied upon for clinical and dosing decisions. For the patisiran -LNP arm, LFTs should be performed according to patisiran -LNP visit windows and do not need to be available prior to dosing. For any other unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study drug administration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per the Medical Monitor or DMC ad vice, until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to adequately explain the abnormality. Additional safety laboratories and assessments as indicated by the clinical situation may be requested."

Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  Results in death  Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at im mediate risk of death from the event as it occurred. It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death)  Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient and may require intervention to pre vent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the development of drug dependency or abuse) Adverse Ev ents of Clinical Interest The following are considered to be AEs of clinical interest:  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >3× upper limit of normal (ULN)  Severe or serious injection site reactions (ISRs), ISRs that are asso ciated with a recall phenomenon (reaction at the site of a prior injection with subsequent injections), recurrent ISRs that are increasing in severity, or ISRs that lead to temporary dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of ALN -TTRSC02 An ISR is d efined as a local reaction at or near the site of injection. “At or near” the injection site includes reactions at the injection site, adjacent to the injection site, or a reaction which may shift slightly away from the injection site due to gravity (eg, as may occur with swelling or hematoma). A systemic reaction which includes the injection site (eg, generalized urticaria, other distinct entities or conditions like lymphadenopathy that may be near the injection site ) is not considered an ISR For inform ation on recording and reporting of AEs of clinical interest, see Section 6.5.7.2 and Section 6.5.7.3 , respectively."
70,page_70,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 Original, 11 October 2018 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 70 Adverse Event Severity Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below: Mild: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Moderate: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (eg, preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money). Severe: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living (ie, bathing, dressing and undressing, fe eding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden); OR life - threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; OR death related to an adverse event. Changes in severity should be documented in the medical record to allow assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity. Adverse events characterized as intermittent require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence. When changes in the severity of an AE occur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should be noted. If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). AE severity and seriousness are assessed independently. ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity of an AE. ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAE). Relationship of the Adverse Event to Study Drug The relationship of ea ch AE to study drug should be evaluated by the Investigator by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drug?” 6.5.7.2. Eliciting and Recording Adverse Events Eliciting Adverse Events The patient and legal guardian, if applicable, should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last visit. The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospitalized, had any accidents, used any new medications, o r changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC). In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant laboratory findings, physical examination findings, ECG changes, or other findings that are rel evant to patient safety. Recording Adverse Events The Investigator is responsible for recording non -serious AEs that are observed or reported by the patient after administration of the first dose of study drug regardless of their relationship to study drug through the end of study. Non -serious AEs will be followed until the end of study. Events occurring after signing of the ICF and before study drug administration will be captured"

The Investigator is responsible fo r recording SAEs that are observed or reported by the patient after the time when the informed consent is signed regardless of their relationship to study drug through the end of study. SAEs will be followed until satisfactory resolution, until baseline l evel is reached, or until the SAE is considered by the Investigator to be chronic or the patient is stable, as appropriate. For patients who discontinue study drug early and remain in the study, all AEs will be collected for 90 days after the last dose, th ereafter, SAEs and AEs of clinical interest (see definition in Section 6.5.7.1 ) will be collected for the remainder of their participation in the st udy. All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug -related. Each AE must be described in detail: onset time and date, description of event, seve rity, relationship to study drug, action taken, and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). For SAEs, record the event(s) in the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section 6.5.7.1 ), the Sponsor or its designee should complete the supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF. Additional clinical and laboratory information may be collected. Refer to CRF completion guidelines for details on reporting events in the supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF. For all ISRs, the Investigator, or delegate, should submit an Injection Site Reaction Signs or Symptoms eCRF, record ing additional information regarding each injection site reaction that is entered on the AE eCRF (eg, symptom(s), injection site location, follow -up actions taken, etc.). If patients develop ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency, for example r educed night vision or night blindness, the Investigator should consult with the Medical Monitor to determine if an ophthalmological assessment is needed. Any information collected during an ophthalmological assessment should be recorded in the eCRF and r eports or images of ophthalmological assessments should be collected as well. 6.5.7.3. Reporting Adverse Events of Clinical Interest to Sponsor/Designee For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section 6.5.7.1 ), the Sponsor or its designee should be notified within 24 hours using a supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF. 6.5.7.4. Serious Adverse Events Require Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by the Investigator. Any AE and laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section 6.5.7.1 must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours from the time that clinical study center staff first learns of the event. All SAEs must be reported regardless of the relationship to study drug."

All SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, will be followed b y the Investigator until satisfactory resolution or the Investigator deems the SAE to be chronic or stable. Clinical, laboratory, and diagnostic measures should be employed by the Investigator as needed to adequately determine the etiology of the event. 6.5.7.5. Sponsor Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities The Sponsor or its representative will report certain study events in an expedited manner to the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency’s EudraVigilance electronic system according to D irective 2001/20/EC, and to all country Regulatory Authorities where the study is being conducted, according to local applicable regulations. 6.5.7.6. Serious Adverse Event Notification to the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Suspected unexpe cted serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) will be reported to the IRB/IEC per their institutional policy by the Investigator or Sponsor (or Sponsor designee) according to country requirements. Copies of each report and documentation of IRB/IEC notification and acknowledgement of receipt will be kept in the Investigator’s study file. 6.5.7.7. Pregnancy Reporting If a female patient becomes pregnant during the study through 90 days following the last dose of study drug, the Investigator must report the pregnancy to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours of being notified of the pregnancy. Details of the pregnancy will be recorded on the pregnancy reporting form. The patient should receive any necessary counseling regarding the risks of continuing the pregnancy, the p ossible effects on the fetus, and be counseled to not breastfeed for 90 days after the last dose of study drug. The pregnancy should be followed by the Investigator until completion. At the completion of the pregnancy, the Investigator will document the o utcome of the pregnancy.

Overdose Reporting An overdose is defined as any dose administered to or taken by a patient (accidentally or intentionally) that e xceeds the highest daily dose, or is at a higher frequency, than included in the protocol. The investigator will decide whether a dose is to be considered an overdose, in consultation with the Sponsor. In the event of an overdose, the actual dose adminis tered must be recorded in the eCRF. All reports of overdose (with or without an AE) must be reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor or designee. 6.6. Biomarkers, DNA Genotyping, and Biospecimen Repository Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutics platform permits the highly specific targeting of investigational therapies based on genetic sequence. It is possible that variations in the target genetic sequence will result in variations in drug effect. More generally, genetic variations may account for the well -described heterogeneous manifestations of disease in patients with hATTR amyloidosis, as well as their responses to treatment. Where allowed per local regulations, ethics committee (IRB/EC) approval, and patient consent (and assent, where applicable), samples will b e collected as part of this study to permit exploratory investigations and the application of novel approaches to bioanalyses that may further elucidate the outcomes of this study, or potentially advance understanding of the safety, mechanism of action, an d/or efficacy of ALN -TTRSC02 and patisiran -LNP . Biological specimens will be collected at the intervals indicated in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1 through Table 5). Potential exploratory investigations may include DNA, RNA, or biochemical metabolite assessments as they relate to disease progre ssion, efficacy or safety. The biospecimen repository will also include residual material from routine samples (safety laboratory samples, PK samples, etc.) that are obtained during the study. These specimens will be securely stored in a central bioreposi tory for up to 10 years following the completion of this clinical study (ie, last patient last visit), or as per local regulations. After 10 years have elapsed, samples will be destroyed. Details regarding the collection, processing, storage, and shipping of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual. Exploratory analysis of these biospecimens will be performed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals or its designees. When biobanking is permitted by local regulation, study participants will be advised during the informed consent process of these biobanking details and the potential for exploratory investigation of their samples."

Patient and Caregiver Impact Survey To complement medical records, information about how hATTR amyloido sis impacts the lives of patients and their caregivers will be collected at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 3). The Patient and Caregiver Impact Survey includes questions related to how hATTR amyloidosis affects patients, including their symptoms at the time of diagnosis, utilization of various healthcare providers, employment status, and need for government compensation/assistance. Questions will also be asked about how hATTR amyloidosis impacts the employment status of the patient's caregiver and patients' nee d for both informal and professional caregivers. 6.7.2. Hospitalization, Urgent Healthcare Visits, Surgeries, and Procedures Hospitalization, urgent healthcare visits, surgeries, and procedure information will be collected on a separate eCRF for pharmacoeconomic evaluations, as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 3). Prior hospitalization, urgent healthcare visits, surgeries, and procedure information through 12 months prior to first dose should be collected at Screening . 6.7.3. Patient Experience Survey The Patient Experience Survey will be a dministered to understand patients' level of satisfaction with their current hATTR amyloidosis therapy and their level of comfort using this therapy. This survey will be administered at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 3). 6.7.4. Patient Preference Survey This Patient Preference Survey will only be administered to patients who were randomized to the patisiran -LNP arm and switched to treatment with ALN -TTRSC02 in the Treatment Extension Period. The survey will be administered to understand patients' preferred method of administration and the primary reasons for their preference. This survey will be administered at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3). 7. STATISTICS The principal features of the planned analysis are presented in this section. A separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to first patient dosed . The SAP will detail the implementation of the statistical analyses in accordance with the principal features stated in the protocol. 7.1.

For the co -primary efficacy endpoints mNIS+7 an d Norfolk QoL -DN total scores, the ALN -TTRSC02 arm in the Phase 3 study will be compared to the placebo arm from the APOLLO study. For the mNIS+7 change from baseline at 9 months, the observed mean (± standard deviation [ SD]) was 15 ± 17 points for the pla cebo arm from the APOLLO study. Assuming a mean change of 0 point s for the ALN -TTRSC02 arm, there is >90% power to establish the superiority over placebo using a 2 - sided t -test with a significance level of 0.05. For the Norfolk -QoL DN total score change from baseline at 9 months, the observed mean (±SD) was 11.5 ± 19.2 points for the placebo arm from the APOLLO study. Assuming a mean change of -4 points for the ALN -TTRSC02 arm, there is >90% power to establish the superiority over placebo using a 2 -sided t-test with a significance level of 0.05. For safety, a sample size of >100 patients on ALN -TTRSC02 can provide reasonable assurance that the true cumulative one -year incidence of adverse drug events (ADE) is no greater than 3% when no ADE is observed. To match the cardiac disease severity with the APOLLO study population, the study plans to enroll no more than 1 5% of patients with NT -proBNP values greater than 3000 ng/L. 7.2. Statistical Methodology 7.2.1. Populations to be Analyzed The population analysis sets are defined as follows:  Modified ITT (mITT) population: All randomized patients who received any amount of study drug. Patients will be grouped by their randomized treatment group.  Safety Population: All randomized patients wh o received any amount of study drug, grouped according to the treatment actually received.  PK Population: All randomized patients who received any amount of study drug and have at least 1 post dose blood sample for PK parameters and have evaluable PK data.  Patients with cardiac involvement: All patients in the mITT population who had pre - existing evidence of cardiac amyloid involvement. Specific details will be provided in the SAP. The primary population for efficacy analysis will be the mITT population. S afety analysis will be conducted in the safety population. PK analysis will be conducted in the PK population. Selected endpoints will be analyzed in the cardiac subpopulation. 7.2.2.

Handling of Missing Data For efficacy assessments, if the scheduled visits (eg, 9 -month) are not performed, the unscheduled and/or discontinuation visits performed within a 3 -month window will be g rouped with the scheduled assessments. Sensitivity analyses for the co -primary endpoints, including different methods for handling of the missing data, will be conducted to assess the robustness of the primary analysis results. More details of missing da ta handling will be described in the SAP. 7.2.4. Baseline Evaluations Demographics and other baseline characteristics, including disease -specific information, will be summarized descriptively. 7.2.5. Efficacy Analyses This Phase 3 study will use the placebo arm of the A POLLO study as an external control. Patient -level data from this study will be compared with patient -level data from APOLLO for efficacy analyses. For the co -primary and secondary clinical efficacy endpoints, the ALN - TTRSC02 arm in this study will be com pared to the placebo arm from the APOLLO study. For the secondary endpoint of TTR percent reduction, the ALN -TTRSC02 arm in this study will be compared to the patisiran -LNP arm in this study. The treatment comparison will be conducted at Month 9 and/or Mo nth 18. The efficacy endpoints beyond 18 months will be summarized descriptively. The patisiran -LNP arm in this study will mainly serve as a reference arm. For the clinical efficacy endpoints at Month 9 and Month 18, the patisiran -LNP arm will be summari zed descriptively and the treatment difference between ALN -TTRSC02 and patisiran -LNP arm in this study will not be tested. In addition, the efficacy assessments over time for patients before and after the switch to ALN -TTRSC02 will be summarized. 7.2.5.1. Co-Prim ary Endpoint The co -primary endpoints are change from baseline at Month 9 for mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL- DN total scores. The co -primary endpoints will be each be tested at a significant level of 0.05 and both must be significant to declare a positive trial. The primary comparison will be conducted at Month 9 and additional analyses will be performed at Month 18. The co -primary endpoint mNIS+7 will compare change in mNIS+7 from baseline at Month 9 between the ALN -TTRSC02 group in this study and the placebo gro up in the APOLLO study. The treatment effect will be estimated based on the least -square (LS) means using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline mNIS+7 score as a covariate and factors including treatment group (ALN -TTRSC02 vs placebo), gen otype (V30M vs non -V30M) and age of disease onset (<50 vs ≥50 years old). The other co -primary endpoint Norfolk QoL-DN total score will compare change at Month 9 between the ALN -TTRSC02 group in this study and the placebo group in the APOLLO study. The tre atment effect will be estimated based on the least -square (LS) means using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline score as a covariate and factors including treatment"

Co-primary endpoint data that are missing will be multiply imputed separately for each treatment group using a regression procedure based on baseline covariates. The details will be spe cified in the SAP. The co -primary endpoints for the patisiran -LNP group in this study will be summarized descriptively. 7.2.5.2. Secondary Endpoints For the secondary clinical efficacy endpoints, the treatment comparison will be made between the ALN -TTRSC02 group in this study and the placebo group in the APOLLO study. For the TTR percent reduction endpoint, the ALN -TTRSC02 group will be compared with the patisiran - LNP group in this study. To control the overall type I error, the secondary endpoints will be tested in the following hierarchical order :  10-MWT gait speed change from baseline at Month 9  mBMI (BMI [kg/m2] multiplied by serum albumin level [g/L]) change from baseline at Month 9  R-ODS change from baseline at Month 9  TTR percent reduction through 9 months  All-cause hospitalization and death events over 18 months (overall population)  All-cause hospitalization and death events over 18 months (patients with cardiac involvement) For 10 -MWT gait speed, mBMI, and R -ODS, the analysis will be based on an ANCOVA mod el similar to the model described for the analysis of N orfolk QoL -DN while adjusting for baseline value of the endpoint being modeled. In the APOLLO study, mBMI was not assessed at Month 9. The average values of Day 189 and Day 357 will be derived as Mont h 9. The primary comparison will be conducted at Month 9 and additional analyses will be performed at Month 18. The TTR percent reduction through Month 9 will be derived as the average trough TTR percent reduction from Month 6 to 9 which is the steady stat e period for both ALN -TTRSC02 and patisiran -LNP. A Hodges -Lehmann method stratified by previous TTR stabilizer use (yes vs no) will be used to estimate the 95% CI for the median difference between the ALN -TTRSC02 and patisiran -LNP groups in this study. Non -inferiority will be declared if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the treatment difference is greater than –10%. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted to compare the TTR percent reduction between the ALN -TTRSC02 group from this study and the pooled pat isiran -LNP groups from this Phase 3 study and the APOLLO study. The composite endpoint of all -cause hospitalization and death events over 18 months will be analyzed using recurrent event method Andersen -Gill model with treatment group (ALN - TTRSC02 vs pla cebo) as an independent variable. The endpoint will be analyzed for both the overall population and in patients with cardiac involvement."

Compliance with GCP provides public assu rance that the rights, safety, and well -being of study patients are protected consistent with the principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 8.1.1. Informed Consent The Investigator will ensure that the patient/legal guardian is given full and adequate oral and written information about the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study. Patients/legal guardians must also be notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time. The patient/legal guardian should be given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided. The patient’s/legal guardian’s signed and dated informed consent must be obtained before conducting any study tests or procedures that are not part of routine care. The Investigator must maintain the original, signed ICF. A copy of the signed ICF must be given to the patient/legal guardian. 8.1.2. Ethical Review The study protocol, including the ICF (assent form, if applicable), must be approved or given a favorable opinion in writing by an IRB or IEC, as appropriate. The Investigator must submit written approval before he or she can enroll any patient into the study. The Investigator is responsible for informing the IRB or IEC of any amendment to the protocol in ac cordance with local requirements. In addition, the IRB or IEC must approve all patient materials for the study. The protocol must be reapproved by the IRB or IEC upon receipt of amendments and annually, as local regulations require. Initial IRB or IEC ap proval of the protocol, and all materials approved by the IRB or IEC for this study including the patient consent form and recruitment materials must be maintained by the Investigator and made available for inspection. The Investigator will submit reports of SAEs as outlined in Section 6.5.7 . In addition, the Investigator agrees to submit progress reports to the IRB or IEC per their local reporting requirements, or at least annually and at the conclusion of the study.

The Sponsor or designee will provide this information to the Investigator. Major changes in this research activity, except those to remove an apparent immediate hazard to the patient, must be reviewed and approved by the Sponso r and the IRB or IEC that approved the study. Amendments to the protocol must be submitted in writing to the Investigator’s IRB or IEC and the Regulatory Authority for approval before patients are enrolled or randomized under the amended protocol, and pat ients must be re -consented to the most current version of the ICF. 8.1.3. Serious Breach of Protocol Investigators must notify the medical monitor within 24 hours of becoming aware of a serious breach of the protocol. A serious breach is a breach that is likely to affect to a significant degree the safety and rights of a study participant or the reliability and robustness of the data generated in the clinical trial. 8.1.4. Study Documentation, Confidentiality, and Records Retention All documentation relating to the stud y should be retained for 2 years after the last approval in an ICH territory or as locally required, whichever is longer. If it becomes necessary for the Sponsor, the Sponsor’s designee, applicable IRB/IEC, or applicable regulatory authorities to review o r audit any documentation relating to the study, the Investigator must permit direct access to all source documents/data. Records will not be destroyed without informing the Sponsor in writing and giving the Sponsor the opportunity to store the records fo r a longer period of time at the Sponsor’s expense. The Investigator must ensure that the patients’ confidentiality will be maintained. On the eCRFs or other documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, patients should not be identified by their nam es, but by the assigned patient number or code. If patient names are included on copies of documents submitted to the Sponsor or designees, the names will be obliterated and the assigned patient number added to the document. Documents not for submission to the Sponsor (eg, signed ICFs) should be maintained by the Investigator in strict confidence. The Investigator must treat all of the information related to the study and the compiled data as confidential, whose use is for the purpose of conducting the st udy. The Sponsor must approve any transfer of information not directly involved in the study. To comply with local and/or regional regulations, this clinical study may be registered and study results may be posted on public registries, such as ClinicalTria ls.gov. 8.1.5. End of Study The end of study is defined as the last patient last visit. 8.1.6. Termination of the Clinical Study or Site Closure The Sponsor reserves the right to terminate the study for clinical or administrative reasons at any time. If the site does not recruit at a reasonable rate, or if there is insufficient adherence to the protocol requirements, the study may be closed at that site. Should the study be terminated and/or the site closed for whatever reason, all documentation and study drug pertain ing to the"

The Investigator should promptly inform the pat ients, and assure appropriate therapy and follow -up. 8.2. Data Quality Control and Quality Assurance 8.2.1. Data Handling Study data must be recorded on CRFs (paper and/or electronic) provided by the Sponsor or designee on behalf of the Sponsor. Case report forms must be completed only by persons designated by the Investigator. If eCRFs are used, study data must be entered by trained site personnel with access to a valid and secure eCRF system. All data entered into the eCRF must also be available in the source d ocuments. Corrections on paper CRFs must be made so as to not obliterate the original data and must be initialed and dated by the person who made the correction. 8.2.2. Study Monitoring The Monitor, as a representative of the Sponsor, has an obligation to closel y follow the study conduct at the site. The monitor will visit the Investigator and clinical study center periodically and will maintain frequent telephone and written contact. The monitor will maintain current personal knowledge of the study through obs ervation, review of study records and source documentation, and discussion of the conduct of the study with the Investigator and staff. The monitor will review source documents, systems and CRFs to ensure overall quality and completeness of the data and to confirm study procedures are complied with the requirements in the study protocol accurately. The Sponsor, or its designee, will be allowed to conduct site visits to the investigation facilities for the purpose of monitoring any aspect of the study. The Investigator agrees to allow the monitor to inspect the drug storage area, study drug stocks, drug accountability records, patient charts and study source documents, site standard operating procedures and training records, and other records relative to stu dy conduct. 8.2.3. Audits and Inspections Periodically, the Sponsor or its authorized representatives audit clinical investigative sites as an independent review of core trial processes and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP guidelines of the ICH, and any applicable regulatory requirements. A regulatory authority, an IEC or an IRB may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including sour ce data verification. The Investigator should contact the Sponsor and designee immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency, an IEC or an IRB about an inspection. 8.3.

Patients will be randomized 3:1 to ALN - TTRSC02 o r patisiran, a reference comparator. Randomization will be stratified by TTR genotype (V30M vs. non -V30M) and baseline NIS score (<50 vs ≥50). The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 42 days, an 18 -month Treatment Period, and an 18-month Ran domized Treatment Extension Period (RTE) as of Amendment 4, in lieu of the 18 -month Treatment Extension Period (hereafter referred to as the Legacy Treatment Extension Period). A Follow - up Period of up to 1 year will occur after the last dose of study dru g. 18-Month Treatment Period After the Screening period at the start of the Treatment Period, eligible patients will be randomized 3:1 on Day 1 to receive 25 mg of ALN -TTRSC02 administered as a n SC injection q3M or patisiran administered as an IV infusion q3w. During the 18 -month Treatment Period, patients will undergo assessments for efficacy and/or safety (as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments), with key efficacy assessments being perform ed prior to first dose, at Month 9 (primary efficacy analysis timepoint) , and at Month 18 ; samples for TTR assessment will be collected more frequently throughout the 18 -month Treatment Period . All efficacy visits must be conducted at the clinic ( Month 9, Month 18, and modified efficacy visits ). In situations in which a Month 9 or Month 18 efficacy visit is unable to be completed due to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic limiting the patient’s ability or willingness to access the study center or their ability to have received their scheduled doses of study drug, the Medical Monitor should be consulted as soon as possible to determine the appropriate timing of the Month 9 or Month 18 efficacy assessments as applicable. After consultation with the Medical Monitor, the Month 9 or Month 18 efficacy assessments may be completed within 6 months after the intended time point (ie, up to Month 15 or Month 24, respectively). The placebo arm of the APOLLO study will be used as an external control for the primary, most secondary, and most exploratory efficacy analysis. Primary and secondary efficacy evaluations will include mNIS+7, Norfolk QoL -DN questionnaire, 10 -MWT, mBMI, R -ODS questionnaire, and percent TTR reduction. Study personnel performing the m NIS+7 component assessments will not reference the results of any previous assessments. Randomized Treatment Extension (RTE) Period"

Study Drug, Dose, and Mode of Administration ALN -TTRSC02 drug product is a subcutaneously (SC) administered N -acetyl galactosamine ligand (GalNAc) -conjugated small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeti ng liver -expressed transthyretin (TTR) messenger RNA (mRNA). ALN -TTRSC02 will be administered as a 25 mg SC injection q3M (12 weeks). Reference Treatment, Dose, and Mode of Administration Patisiran drug product is an intravenously (IV) administered siRNA targeting liver -expressed TTR mRNA formulated with lipid excipients (DLin -MC3 -DMA, DSPC, cholesterol, and PEG 2000-C-DMG) in isotonic ph osphate buffered saline. Patisiran will be administered as a 0.3 mg/kg IV infusion once every 3 weeks (q3w) ± 3 days . All patients will receive premedication prior to patisiran infusions as described further in the protocol. Duration of Treatment and Study The estimated time on study for each patient is a maximum of 5 years, inclusive of 42 days of Screening, and up to 54 months of open -label treatment ( including 18 months in the Treatment Period, 0 to 18 months in the Legacy Treatment Extension Period and 18 months in the Randomized Treatment Extension Period ), plus a Follow -Up Period up to 1 year . During the Follow -up Period, all patients on ALN -TTRSC02 will undergo safety assessments quarterly until serum TTR levels return to ≥80% of baseline (for up to 1 year after the last dose of study drug), or until the patient starts a TTR lowering regimen as a part of clinical care, whichever comes first; all patients will be followed for a minimum of 3 months. Female patients of child -bearing potential who discontinue ALN -TTRSC02 will be followed until serum TTR levels return to ≥80% of baseline. Statistica l Methods A full statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to first patient dosed. The primary endpoint mNIS+7 will compare change in mNIS+7 from baseline at Month 9 between the ALN -TTRSC02 group in this study and the placebo group in the APO LLO study. The treatment effect will be estimated based on the least squares (LS) means using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with baseline mNIS+7 score as a covariate and factors including treatment group (ALN -TTRSC02 vs placebo), genotype (V30M vs non -V30M) and age of disease onset (<50 vs ≥50 years old). The primary endpoint will be tested at a significance level of 0.05 and must be significant to declare a positive trial. For the key secondary endpoint s of change in Norfolk QoL -DN total score and 10 -MWT gait speed from baseline at Month 9, the analysis will be based on an ANCOVA model similar to the model described for the analysis of change in mNIS+7 from baseline at Month 9, while adjusting for baseline value of the"
99,page_99,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 (vutrisiran) Amendment 4, 19 February 2021 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 9 endpoint being modeled and including baseline NIS score (<50 vs ≥50) as an additional factor in the model. For these 2 endpoints, data that are missing will be multiply imputed separately for each treatment group using a regression procedure based on baseline covariates. For chang e from baseline at Month 18 analyses, the analysis will be based on a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM), adjusting for a covariate (baseline value for the endpoint being modeled), categorical factors (treatment group, visit [Month 9 vs Month 18], genotype, age of disease onset, baseline NIS score), and an interaction term (treatment group by visit). For mNIS+7, baseline NIS score will not be included in the model. The primary endpoint for the patisiran group in this study will be summarized d escriptively. The TTR percent reduction through Month 18 will be derived as the average trough TTR percent reduction from Month 6 to 18 which is the steady state period for both ALN -TTRSC02 and patisiran. A Hodges -Lehmann method stratified by previous TTR stabilizer use (yes vs no) will be used to estimate the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the median difference between the ALN -TTRSC02 and patisiran groups in this study. Non -inferiority will be declared if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the treatment difference is greater than –10%. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted to compare the TTR percent reduction between the ALN -TTRSC02 group from this study and the pooled patisiran groups from this Phase 3 study and the APOLLO study. Overall type I error control for secondary endpoints will be achieved by a hierarchical testing procedure. The analysis of exploratory efficacy endpoint s will be described in the SAP. Safety data will be summarized descriptively."

Disease Overview Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis (hATTR amyloidosis) is a rare, life -threatening, autosomal dominant, multi -systemic disease caused by mutations in the transthyretin (TTR) gene that results in rapidly progressive, d ebilitating morbidity and high mortality. The cardinal manifestations of hATTR amyloidosis are polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy. TTR, also known as prealbumin, is a tetrameric protein predominantly produced by hepatocytes (>95% of circulating TTR is live r-derived), with a smaller fraction produced by the choroid plexus and retina [Liz 2010 ]. The primary physiological role of TTR is to serve as a carrier of retinol (also known as vitamin A), which involves TTR binding to the retinol binding protein (RBP): vitamin A complex. TTR also serves as a minor carrier for thyroxine (T4). In hATTR amy loidosis, inherited mutations in the TTR gene lead to destabilization of the tetrameric protein and disassociation of the TTR subunits into dimers and individual mutant and wild-type (wt) monomers, which subsequently misfold. These misfolded TTR monomers can then self -assemble into oligomers and form amyloid fibrils and plaques in the extracellular space of various tissues [Hou 2007 ], including the peripheral nervous system, heart, gastrointestinal tract, ki dney, central nervous system and eye, leading to cellular injury and organ dysfunction with corresponding clinical manifestations. Since almost all patients are heterozygous for the mutated TTR allele, the amyloid fibrils typically consist of both mutant a nd wtTTR. There are over 120 reported TTR genetic mutations associated with hATTR [Ando 2013 ; Brodsky 2008 ; Connors 2003 ]. The disease is mo st often caused by the valine to methionine mutation at position 30 in the human TTR gene (V30M)primarily in families with heritage from Portugal, Sweden, Japan, and Brazil [Parman 2016 ]. Another common genotype is the isoleucine substitution for valine at positi on 122 (V122I). This mutation occurs in up to 4% of African Americans and in over 5% of West African populations [Jacobson 1997 ]. Historically, due to incomplete understanding of etiology and pathogenesis, 2 clinical syndromes of hATTR amyloidos is have been described in the medical literature: hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (previously known as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, or FAP) and hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (previously known as familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy, or FAC), both of which are characterized by amyloid deposits comprised of both mutant and wt TTR [Yazaki 2000 ]. However, while patients with hATTR amyloidosis may present with predominantly polyneuropathy or cardi omyopathy, most patients with hATTR amyloidosis manifest signs and symptoms of both polyneuropathy and cardiomyopathy over the course of their disease. Therefore, hATTR amyloidosis is increasingly viewed as a single hereditary disease with a spectrum of c linical manifestations rather than 2 distinct syndromes [Swiecicki 2015 ]. The clinical manifestations of the length -dependent, symmetrical polyneuropathy are the result of amyloid -mediated injury to large and small peripheral nerve fibers [Ando 2013 ; Benson and Kincaid 2007 ; Plante -Bordeneuve and Said 2011 ]. Sensory abnormalities include painful dysesthesias in the feet and hands, as well as loss of sensation leading to thermal burns in these areas and to joint injury in the lower limbs. Progressive muscle atrophy and motor weak ness in both lower and upper limbs leads to impaired ambulation (progressing from the use of one stick"
130,page_130,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 (vutrisiran) Amendment 4, 19 February 2021 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 40 to two for ambulation, followed by needing to use a wheel chair and then becoming bed -ridden over just a few years), and inability to perform other activ ities of daily living. Autonomic dysfunction results in debilitating orthostatic hypotension, severe gastrointestinal symptoms, and bladder dysfunction with recurrent urinary tract infections. Polyneuropathy stage or severity is classified by FAP stage or Polyneuropathy Disability (PND) score, both of which are based on ambulatory ability. The degree of neurologic impairment has historically been measured using the Neurologic Impairment Score (NIS), which has been shown to be correlated with FAP stage a nd PND score; an increase from baseline in NIS score signifies worsening in neurologic impairment, which in turn correlates with a higher FAP stage designation and PND score [Adams 2015 ]. The maximum impairment score for the NIS is 244 points, and a change from baseline of 10 to 14 points per year has been observed in untreated patients based on data from an hATTR amyloidos is clinical study and an observational natural history study [Adams 2015 ; Berk 2013 ]. This is in contrast to patients with diabetic polyneuropathy where NIS progression is <1 point/year [Ziegler 2011 ]. For clinical studies, the modified NIS+7 (mNIS+7) score, a more sensitive measure with a scale from 0 to 304 points, has been developed to prov ide a more comprehensive measure of polyneuropathy in patients with hATTR amyloidosis [Suanprasert 2014 ]. Cardiac infiltration with amyloid leads to heart wall thickening and cardiomyopathy characterized by clinical heart failure due to both diastolic and systolic dysfunction, as well as cardiac conduction disturbances and arrhythmias [Ando 2013 ; Benson and Kincaid 2007 ; Carvalho 1992 ; Connors 2004 ; Soares 2005 ]. Patients with symptomatic heart failure experienc e rapid progression of their amyloid cardiomyopathy, with substantial worsening of echocardiographic and biomarker measures of cardiac function, ambulation, and quality of life seen over a period of 18 months or less [Ruberg and Berk 2012 ]. 1.2. Current Treatments The treatment of hATTR amyloidosis requires a multidisciplinary approach primarily involving neurology, gastroenterology, and cardiology specialties. Palliative/symptomatic therapies directed at specific symptoms such as pain, nausea/vomiting and diarrhea have been the mainstay of treatment. Two treatment approaches that have historically been used for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis are orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), which serves to eliminate mutant TTR from the circulation, but does not aff ect the hepatic production of wt TTR [Carvalho 2015 ; Ericzon 2015 ; Okamoto 2009 ], and TTR tetramer stabilizers (including tafamidis and diflunisal), which have been shown in clinical studies to reduce neuropathy in patients with early stage polyneuropathy [Berk 2013 ; Coelho 2012 ]. However, these therapies are restricted to a small subset of patients with hATTR amyloidosis with early stage neuropathy. Furthermore, the majority of patients receiving tafamidis continue to experience neuropathy progression with a steady decline in quality of life, ability to walk, and to perform activiti es of daily living [Barroso 2017 ]. Recently, the antisense oligonucleotide inotersen and the short interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) patisiran were shown in randomized control led studies to significantly reduce neurologic impairment and improve quality of life compared with placebo in patients with hATTR amyloidosis [Adams 2017 ; Dyck 2017 ; Wang et al. 2017 ]. Both novel therapies, albeit"
131,page_131,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 (vutrisiran) Amendment 4, 19 February 2021 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 41 through different mechanisms, aim at reducing the expression of TTR messenger RNA (mRNA), and the amount of circulating amyloidogenic protein in patients with hATTR amyloidosis. 1.3. RNAi Therapeutics to Reduce TTR Levels Patisiran -LNP (ONPATTRO™; hereafter referred to as patisiran) developed by Alnylam, which targets the production of hepatic TTR, is approved in the US for the treatment of the polyneuropathy of hATTR amyloidosis in adults and in the EU for the treatment of hATTR amyloidosis in adult patients with stage 1 and stage 2 polyneuropathy. The recommended dose of patisiran is 0.3 mg/kg administered via intravenous (IV) infusion once every 3 weeks (q3w). To minimize the risk of infusion related reactions (IRRs), a ll patients must receive pre - medication including corticosteroids (10 mg dexamethasone IV), histamine 1 (H1) and histamine 2 (H2) blockers, and paracetamol or equivalents 60 minutes prior to the infusion. Patisiran utilizes the mechanism of RNA interferenc e to selectively degrade TTR mRNA and thereby reduce the expression of its corresponding protein [Bumcrot 2006 ]. Patisiran is an siRNA that is formulated as lipid nanoparticles (LNP) to target delivery to hepatocytes in the liver, the primary s ource of TTR protein in circulation. Following IV infusion, opsonization of the LNP by apolipoprotein E facilitates binding to the low -density lipoprotein receptor on hepatocytes and subsequent endocytosis. Fusion of the ionizable lipid component of the LNP with the endosomal membrane then leads to release of the siRNA into the cytoplasm where it can bind to and activate the RNA -induced silencing complex (RISC). Upon binding and activation of RISC in the cytoplasm within hepatocytes, the siRNA duplex unwi nds and the antisense strand specifically binds to a genetically conserved sequence in the 3’ untranslated region of wt and mutant TTR mRNA. The Argonaute -2 endonuclease within the RISC/siRNA enzyme complex catalytically degrades wt and mutant TTR mRNA, r esulting in a reduction of wt and mutant TTR protein. Alnylam had also developed another siRNA -conjugate therapeutic, revusiran, primarily for the treatment of patients with hATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy; however, this program was discontinued as described further in the ALN -TTRSC02 Investigator’s Brochure (IB). ALN -TTRSC02 (also known as vutrisiran) is in clinical development for the treatment of ATTR amyloidosis. This molecule is designed to have greater potency and prolonged duration of actio n compared to current and previous siRNAs evaluated in the clinic for treatment of this disease. ALN -TTRSC02 has the same nucleotide sequence as revusiran but employs a different ratio of chemical modifications to confer increased stability of the siRNA. ALN -TTRSC02 drug product comprises the drug substance ALN -65492, an siRNA targeting TTR mRNA that is conjugated to an N -acetyl galactosamine ligand (GalNAc) to facilitate delivery to the liver, formulated in 10 mM sodium phosphate, 110 mM sodium chloride at pH 7 for subcutaneous (SC) injection. Uptake of ALN -TTRSC02 occurs via the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR), a member of the C -type lectin family of receptors that recognizes and binds glycoproteins with terminal galactose (Gal) or GalNAc residues [Ashwell and Morell 1974 ; Nair 2014 ]. It is expressed on the cell su rface of hepatocytes at a high copy number (0.5 -1 million per cell) [Baenziger and Fiete 1980 ; Schwartz 1980 ], and facilitates clearance of desialylated glycoproteins from the blood [Geffen and Spiess 1992 ]. Binding of the carbohydrate ligand to the ASGPR leads to receptor -mediated endocytosis of the ligand -receptor complex followed by"
132,page_132,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 (vutrisiran) Amendment 4, 19 February 2021 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 42 release of its cargo in the endocytic pathway, and subsequent recycling of the receptor to the cell surface for successive rounds of uptake. ALN -TTRSC02 has been shown to have increased potency and duration of TTR reduction in nonclinical species and in a cli nical study in healthy volunteers described in Section 1.4.2 , enabling a much lower dose, lower injection volume, and significantly less frequent dosing for patients compared to other TTR -lowering drugs. 1.4. Clinical Experience with Patisiran and ALN -TTRSC02 1.4.1. The APOLLO Study The safety and efficacy of patisiran was shown in a Phase 3 multicenter, multinational, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controll ed study (ALN -TTR02 -004, APOLLO) that met the primary and all secondary endpoints [Adams 2018 ]. This study demonstrated that in patients with hATTR amyloidosis, who exhibited a broad range of disease severity and TTR genotypes, treatment with patisiran leads to a significant improvement in neuropathy (mNIS+7) relative to placebo at 18 months (primary analysis), as well as significant improvement in quality of life (Norfolk QoL -DN, key secondary analysis) relative to placebo at 18 months. Significant improvement in neuropathy and quality of life were also observed at Month 9. This study furthermore demonstrated that treatment with patisiran is associated with an improvement in overall health (gait speed, nutritional status, and disability), with improvement in these endpoints seen as early as at Month 9. Patisiran treatment was also associated with improvement compared to placebo in exploratory cardiac endpoints including key echocardiographic parameters and the biomarker NT -proBNP [Solomon 2018 ]. In post -hoc analyses, patisiran demonstrated a reduction in the composite event rate of hospitalization and mortality. In the patisiran group, the mean TTR percent reduction from baseline was 82.6% and 84.3% at Month 9 and Month 18, respectively. TTR percent reduction was maintained over the duration of the study. A correlation (Pearson’s r, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.49 -0.68) was observed between the degree of TTR reduction from basel ine and the change in the mNIS+7 at 18 months. Patisiran showed an acceptable safety profile in the APOLLO study. Common adverse events (AEs) occurring more frequently with patisiran compared to placebo included peripheral edema (30% versus 22%) and infus ion related reactions (IRRs) (19% versus 9%, respectively). 1.4.2. ALN -TTRSC02 -001 Phase 1 Clinical Study ALN -TTRSC02 has been evaluated in a recently completed Phase 1 study (study ALN - TTRSC02 -001). ALN -TTRSC02 -001 was a randomized, single -blind, placebo contr olled single - ascending dose study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of ALN -TTRSC02 in healthy subjects and in healthy subjects of Japanese descent. Single doses of 5, 25, 50, 100, 200 or 300 mg ALN -TTRSC02 were administered by SC injection to cohorts of 8 subjects (6:2 ratio ALN -TTRSC02 to placebo). Subjects remained blinded to treatment assignment through Day 90. Eighty healthy volunteers were randomized in 10 cohorts and followed for up to 314 days. ALN -TTRSC02 reduced serum TTR in a dose dependent fashion with higher doses of ALN - TTRSC02 achieving deeper and longer duration of serum TTR reduction. At the proposed dose of 25 mg ALN -TTRSC02, a single dose resulted in maximum TTR reduction of 94% and mean"
133,page_133,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 (vutrisiran) Amendment 4, 19 February 2021 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 43 maximum TTR reduction of 83% that was maintained for 90 days (n=12). Consistent with the expected PD effect, vitamin A levels were also reduced following a single dose of ALN - TTRSC02. Similar PD effects were observed in the subjects of Japanese descen t, as compared to the subjects in the non -Japanese cohorts. AEs were reported in 77% and 50% of ALN -TTRSC02 and placebo treated subjects, respectively. Among ALN -TTRSC02 treated patients, the majority of AEs were mild. ALN - TTRSC02 drug -related AEs includ ed injection site reactions in 4 subjects that were mild and transient including bruising (50 mg), erythema (200 mg) and pain (200 mg and 300 mg); there were no drug -related AEs in patients receiving ALN -TTRSC02 doses ≤25 mg. There were no severe or serio us AEs; no subject discontinued from the study due to an AE. A dose -dependent pattern in transaminase elevations was observed across the ALN -TTRSC02 doses tested, in particular at doses ≥100 mg; the majority were mild, transient, and none were reported as AEs. Most alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) elevations were ≤3 x upper limit of normal (ULN); 1 subject receiving ALN -TTRSC02 50 mg had AST >3 x ULN and 1 subject receiving ALN -TTRSC02 200 mg had ALT and AST >3 x ULN, which were asymptomatic and resolved to <ULN without intervention. There were no concurrent elevations in bilirubin or alkaline phosphatase. There were no clinically significant changes in renal function or hematologic parameters, including platelets and no clinical ly significant changes in electrocardiogram (ECG), vital signs or physical exam. Further information on the chemistry, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety of ALN -TTRSC02 is provided in the current edition of the Investigator’s Brochure. 1.5. Study Design Rationa le This is a global Phase 3 open -label study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and PK/PD profile of ALN -TTRSC02 in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis. Patients will be randomized 3:1 to ALN -TTRSC02 or patisiran. Patisiran is the reference com parator arm. All patients randomized to patisiran will be transitioned to ALN -TTRSC02 after completion of the 18-month Treatment Period. The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 42 days, an 18 -month Treatment Period, and an 18 -month Randomize d Treatment Extension Period (RTE) as of Amendment 4 , in lieu of the 18 -month Treatment Extension Period (hereafter referred to as the Legacy Treatment Extension Period). A Follow -up Period of up to 1 year will occur after the last dose of study drug. See also Section 3.1. The proposed development plan for ALN -TTRSC02 builds upon learnings from the previous development of another siRNA that targets TT R, patisiran (described in Section 1.4). The completed patisiran Phase 3 APOLLO study, which enrolled a similar patient population to the current study and incorporated similar endpoints to the current study, will be used as an external control for efficacy analysis. The primary endpoint in t his study, change from baseline in mNIS+7 score at Month 9, and the key secondary endpoint of Norfolk QoL -DN total score at Month 9, will be compared with the placebo group from the APOLLO study at Month 9 as the primary analysis. The use of an external c ontrol for comparison is supported by the principles outlined in the EMA guideline on clinical trials in small populations (CHMP/EWP/83561/2005), ICH E10 guidance on control groups in clinical trials, as well as the USA's 21st Century Cures Act (Section 30 12 Targeted Drugs for Rare Diseases). Based on these guidelines, an external"
134,page_134,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 (vutrisiran) Amendment 4, 19 February 2021 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 44 comparison is an appropriate clinical study design for diseases occurring in small populations, with well understood natural history of disease course. The natural history of hA TTR amyloidosis has been well -characterized in several, large, randomized clinical trials, including the APOLLO study, as well as natural history studies. Importantly, these studies all demonstrate similar rates of disease progression despite having been conducted at substantially different points in time and in patients with different disease characteristics across different geographies [Adams 2015 ; Adams 2018 ; Berk 2013 ; Maurer 2017 ]. The patisiran reference comparator arm will help to validate the use of the external control for the primary and secondary efficacy analyses both by allowing descriptive comparison of the clinic al efficacy endpoints between treatment arms within this study and by establishing similar (non -inferior) level of TTR reduction is achieved for ALN -TTRSC02 and patisiran. Secondary and exploratory endpoints in this study assessing the clinical manifestations of hATTR amyloidosis are similar to those in the APOLLO study. Additional cardiac assessments are included in this study as exploratory endpoints. These endpoints will all be assessed in comparison to the placebo group in the APOLLO study. Safety will be assessed by monitoring of AEs, laboratory data including liver function tests, changes in physical exam, vital signs, and ECG. 1.6. Dose Rationale The proposed dose of ALN -TTRSC02 for this study is 25 mg SC given q3M. This dose was well-tolerated in the Phase 1 study (see Section 1.4.2 ) and is expected to provide efficacy similar to patisiran based on the anticipated magnitude of TTR lowering. Modeling and simulation predicted that the proposed 25 mg dose of ALN -TTRSC02 administered SC q3M will lead to substantial and persistent serum TTR reduction, comparable to TTR lowering observed with patisiran in the Phase 3 APOLLO study. At steady state, which is achieved by approximately 6 months, 25 mg SC q3M regimen of ALN -TTRSC02 is predicted to achieve median trough TTR reductions of 86%, which is similar to patisiran. This magnitude of TTR lowering is expected to lead to durable clinical benefit as evidenced by the statistically significant difference in mNIS+7 and all the secondary endpoints, including Norfolk QoL -DN, in the patisiran arm compared to placebo in the pivotal Phase 3 APOLLO study. Furthermore, on the Phase 3 APOLLO study, this magnitude of TTR lowering was associated with an acceptable safety profile."
135,page_135,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 (vutrisiran) Amendment 4, 19 February 2021 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 45 Overall, available noncl inical and clinical data suggest the selected dose will appropriately balance safety and efficacy in the broad hATTR patient population. 1.7. Benefit -Risk Assessment Based on available nonclinical and clinical data, with evidence of TTR reduction in the healthy subject study, TTR reduction by ALN -TTRSC02 is anticipated to beneficially impact disease progression in patients with hATTR amyloidosis, as has been shown with other available TTR lowering agents including patisiran and inotersen. The q3M and q6M SC reg imen s are infrequent, easy to administer, do not require premedication, and thus may maximize convenience and minimize overall burden of care. In the Phase 1 clinical study in healthy subjects, single SC doses up to the highest tested dose (300 mg) of ALN -TTRSC02 were well tolerated. Patients with hATTR amyloidosis often suffer substantial loss in ambulation and mobility associated with other comorbidities that significantly impact activities of daily living and can make healthcare visits challenging. aims to further minimize the need for frequent healthcare visits and further mitigate patient burden . This is consistent with global trends toward decreased healthcare encounters , the importance of which has been further highlighted by the COVID -19 pandemic . Given the biological target of ALN -TTRSC02, the available nonclinical and clinical data, and the mode of administration, important potential risks for ALN -TTRSC02 are injection site reactions (ISRs), liver func tion test (LFT) abnormalities, and consequences of vitamin A deficiency. During the study, patients will be closely monitored, including evaluation of injections sites. As ALN -TTRSC02 is targeted for delivery to the liver, there is a potential for develo pment of LFT abnormalities. Patients presenting with any laboratory result considered unacceptable as per exclusion criteria (see Section 4) at tim e of enrollment will be excluded from participation in this study, and LFTs will be routinely monitored throughout the study per the Schedule of Assessments. Criteria for dose withholding, modification and stopping ALN - TTRSC02 dosing due to LFT abnormalit ies are provided in Section 5.2.3 . Detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks of ALN -TTRSC02 and additional safety informa tion may be found in the current edition of the ALN -TTRSC02 Investigator’s Brochure. For patisiran, important identified risks include infusion related reactions (IRRs). All patients must receive premedication with a corticosteroid, paracetamol/acetaminop hen, and H1 and H2 blockers prior to patisiran administration to reduce the risk of IRRs (see Section 5.2.2.2 ). Potential risks include consequences of vitamin A deficiency and severe hypersensitivity (eg, anaphylaxis) to the active substance or any of the excipients. Detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks of patisiran and additional safety information may be found in the current edition of the patisiran Investigator’s Brochure or, where approved, in the ONPATTRO prescribing/product information. Nonclinical and clinical data with ALN -TTRSC02 and patisiran have shown that the lowering of circulating vitamin A associated wit h the reduction in TTR (a carrier of retinol) does not result in severe vitamin A deficiency; transport and tissue uptake of vitamin A can occur through alternative mechanisms in the absence of retinol binding protein. However, as the vitamin A content of the diet may vary between different individuals, all patients will be instructed to take the recommended daily allowance of vitamin A while on the study (see Section 5.2).

Summary of Study Design This is a global Phase 3 randomized, open -label study designed to evaluate efficacy, safety, and PK/PD of ALN -TTRSC02 in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis. Patients will be randomized 3:1 to ALN -TTRSC02 or patisiran, a reference comparator. Randomization will be stratified by TTR genotype (V30M vs. non -V30M) and baseline NIS score (<50 vs ≥50). The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 42 days, an 18 -month Treatment Period, and an 18 -month RTE Period in lieu of the 18 -month Legacy Treatment Extension Period. A Follow -up Period of up to 1 year will occur after the last dose of study drug ( Figure 2)."
138,page_138,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 (vutrisiran) Amendment 4, 19 February 2021 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 48 18-Month Treatment Period After the Screening period at the start of the Treatment Period, eligible patients will be randomized 3:1 on Day 1 to receive 25 mg of ALN -TTRSC02 administered as a SC injection q3M or patisiran administered as an IV infusion q3w; patients in the patisiran arm will also receive premedications prior to each dose (see Section 5.2.2.2 ). During the 18 -month Treatment Period, patients will undergo assessments for efficacy and/or safety (as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments), with key efficacy assessments being perfo rmed prior to first dose, at Month 9 (primary efficacy analysis timepoint) and at Month 18; samples for TTR assessment will be collected more frequently throughout the 18 -month Treatment Period. All efficacy visits must be conducted at the clinic (Month 9 , Month 18, and modified efficacy visits). In situations in which a Month 9 or Month 18 efficacy visit is unable to be completed due to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic limiting the patient’s ability or willingness to access the study cent er or their ability to have received their scheduled doses of study drug, the Medical Monitor should be consulted as soon as possible to determine the appropriate timing of the Month 9 or Month 18 efficacy assessments as applicable. After consultation with the Medical Monitor, the Month 9 or Month 18 efficacy assessments may be completed within 6 months after the intended time point (ie, up to Month 15 or Month 24, respectively). Dosing may be allowed outside of the study center (eg, the patient’s home) un der certain circumstances as specified in Section 5.2.2.1 and Section 5.2.2.2 . In addition, routine assessments and collection of relevant safety information may be collected outside the study center as specified at the beginning of Section 6. The placebo arm of the APOLLO study will be used as an external control for the primary, most secondary, and most exploratory efficacy analysis. Primary and secondary efficacy evaluations will includ e mNIS+7, Norfolk QoL -DN questionnaire, 10 -MWT, mBMI, R -ODS questionnaire, and percent TTR reduction. Study personnel performing the mNIS+7 component assessments will not reference the results of any previous assessments. In order to allow for a robust cro ss study comparison, attempts will be made to minimize differences between the HELIOS -A and APOLLO study populations. As such, baseline disease characteristics will be monitored and may result in enrollment limitations based on certain characteristics (eg, genotype) to ensure comparability. Decisions around enrollment adjustments will be made by staff without access to primary efficacy results. Randomized Treatment Extension (RTE) Period"

A positive urine pregnancy test should be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test prior to discontinuing the study drug. Patients who disco ntinue study drug and/or decline procedural assessments should not be automatically removed from study. In general, patients who discontinue study drug dosing for any reason will be encouraged to remain on the study to complete the remaining assessments so that their experience (including, at a minimum, information on vital status, cardiac transplant procedures, LVAD placement and hospitalizations for the duration of the study) is captured in the final analyses. If this occurs, the Investigator is to dis cuss with the patient the appropriate processes for discontinuation from study drug and must discuss with the subject the options for continuation of the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 3), including different options for follow -up and collection of data (eg, in person, by phone, by mail, through family or friends, or from options not involving patient contact, such as communication with other treating phys icians, or from review of medical records), including endpoints and adverse events, and must document this decision in the patient’s medical records. If a patient discontinues dosing due to an AE, including serious adverse events (SAEs), the event should b e followed as described in Section 6.5.7 . When a patient discontinues study drug dosing, the primary reason must be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). Patients who discontinue study drug and remain on study may receive treatment consistent with local standard practice for their disease per Investigator judgement, as applicable. Patients who discontinue study drug early for any reason during the Treatment Period (defined as the time the first dose of study drug is administered on Study Day 1 through completion of the Month 18 assessments) should complete the Early Drug Discontinuation visit and will be encouraged to remain on the study to complete the modified Month 9 and Month 18 efficacy assessments visits, prioritizing the primary and secondary assessments, where possible so that their experience is captured in the final analyses. If a patient discontinues study drug and completes th e Early Drug Discontinuation visit within 3 months of Month 9 or Month 18 and remains on the study, they will not be required to complete the modified efficacy assessments at Month 9 and/or Month 18, as applicable depending on the time they discontinue stu dy drug (Table 3). Patients who discontinue study drug during the Legacy Treatment Extension Period or the RTE Period will be asked to return to complete the Early Drug Discontinuation visit (Table 3). Patients who discontinue study drug, but who remain on study, may receive treatment consistent with local standard practice for their disease per Investigator j udgment, as applicable. For patients who discontinue study drug and remain in the study, all AEs will be collected for 90 days after the last dose, thereafter, SAEs and AEs of clinical interest (see definition in Section 6.5.7.1 ) will be collected for the remainder of their participation in the study. All patients who discontinue study drug will also be asked to complete safety follow -up visits, per the Follow -up Period schedule (see Table 4) until serum TTR levels return to ≥80% of baseline (for up to 1 year after the last dose of study drug), or until the patient starts a TTR lowering regimen as a part of clinical care, whicheve r comes first; all patients will be followed"

Female patients of child -bearing potential who discontinue ALN - TTRSC02 will be followed until serum TTR levels return to ≥80% of baseline. 4.3.2. Stopping a Patient’s Study Participation 4.3.2.1. Patient or Legal Guardian Stops Participation in the Study A patient or their legal guardian may stop participation in the study at any time. Patients considering stopping their participation in the study should be informed that they can discontinue study dru g and/or decline procedural assessments and remain in the study for the collection of important study data as described in Section 4.3.1. If a patie nt still chooses to discontinue study drug and stop participation in all follow -up, every effort should be made to conduct the Early Drug Discontinuation Visit assessments in Table 3 within 4 weeks of the last dose during the Treatment Period, and at any time during the Legacy Treatment Extension Period or the RTE Period . If the patient does not wish to or is unable to continue further study participation, the Investigator is to discuss with the patient appropriate procedures for stopping participation in the study. Data collected from the patient can continue to be used. In addition, in the countries where the collection and processing of the patient data is based on the patient’s consent, if a patient withdraws consent to collect and process his/her data (see Section 4.3.2.2 ), as applicable, patient data up to the withdrawal of consent will be included in the analysis of the study. In addition, where permitted, publicly available data (such as appropriate national or regional vital status registry or other relevant databases) can be included after wi thdrawal of consent, where available and allowable by local law. 4.3.2.2. Withdrawal of Consent to Process the Patient’s Personal Data Where allowed by local law, the patient may decide to withdraw consent to collect, store, use biological samples and as applicable , other personal data, informing the study doctor at any time in writing or in any other form that may be locally required. The Sponsor will continue to keep and use the patient’s study information (including any data resulting from the analysis of the patient’s biological samples until the time of withdrawal) according to applicable law. The process for the storage and, as applicable, further use of remaining samples will be followed per local requirements. 4.3.2.3. Investigator or Sponsor Stops Participation of a Patient in the Study The Investigator or Sponsor may stop the participation of a patient in the study at any time if this is considered to be in the patient’s best interest. However, study integrity and interpretation are best maintained if all enrolled p atients continue study assessments and follow -up even if study drug is discontinued. Termination of the clinical study and site closure are described in Section 8.1.6 . 4.3.2.4. Recording Reason for Stopping a Patient’s Study Participation The primary reason that a patient’s study participation is stopped must be recorded in the appropriate section of the eCRF and all efforts will be made to complete and report the"

If a patient’s study participation is stopped due to an AE, including SAEs, the event should be followed as described in Section 6.5.7 . 4.3.3. Lost to Follow -Up A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if the patient repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the clinical study center. The following actions must be tak en if a patient misses a required study visit: • The site must attempt to contact the patient and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain if the patien t wishes to continue in the study and/or should continue in the study. • Before a patient is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the patient (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the patient’s medical record. • Should the patient continue to be unreachable, the patient will be considered to ha ve stopped participation in the study. • For patients who are lost to follow -up, the Investigator can search publicly available records (where permitted and allowed by local law) to ascertain survival status. Attempts should also be made to collect information related to cardiac transplant procedures, left -ventricular assist device placement and hospitalizations from other sources for the duration of the study. This ensures that the outcome of the study is as comprehensive as possible. 4.3.4. Replacement of Study Patients Patients who discontinue the study drug or stop participation in the study will not be replaced. 5. TREATMENTS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS 5.1. Treatments Administered Study drug supplied for this study must not be used for any purpose other than the present study and must not be administered to any person not enrolled in the study.

ALN -TTRSC02 ALN -TTRSC02 25 mg SC injectio n will be administered q3M (12 weeks ±3 days during the Treatment Period . Study drug SC injections in the clinic will be administered under the supervision of the Investigator or a trained healthcare professional. ALN -TTRSC02 may be administered at a location other than the study center (e g, the patient’s home) as specified below. If a patient has tolerated at least 1 dose of ALN -TTRSC02 in the clinic, subsequent dosing may be administered outside the study site (eg, the patient’s home) at all time points where allowed by applicable country and local regulations. In these cases, dosing should be administered by a trained healthcare professional, with oversight by the Investigator. If the patient is unable to come to the study center, and a visit by a home healthcare professional is not poss ible due to circumstances related to the COVID -19 pandemic, ALN -TTRSC02 25 mg SC q3M may be administered by the patient or the caregiver under the oversight of the Investigator, and following consultation with the Medical Monitor, as allowed by applicable country and local regulations. In such cases, the patient or caregiver must receive appropriate training on ALN - TTRSC02 administration. This measure is intended to remain in effect only during periods of time when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the abilit y of patients to travel to the study site or healthcare professionals to go to patients' homes for dosing."

In addition, instructions and procedures related to administration of ALN - TTRSC02 (25 mg q3M only) by a patient or caregiver will be provided in the Patient/Caregiver Storage and Administration Instructions. Method of Administration of ALN -TTRSC02 ALN -TTRSC02 is for SC use. The SC injection site may be marked and mapped for later observation. The preferred site of injection is the abdomen. Optional additional sites are the upper arms and thighs. If a local reaction around the injection site occurs, photographs may be obtai ned. Additional details, including detailed instructions for study drug administration, can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. Detailed Instructions for Use for the pre -filled syringe will also be provided. Missed Doses of ALN -TTRSC02 If a patient does not r eceive a dose of ALN -TTRSC02 within the specified dosing window, the Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor. After such consultation, the dose may be administered with up to an 8 -week delay or as determined by the Medical Monitor (to be considered a delayed dose). If a dose is administered with a delay, the next dose will resume following the original schedule. In cases in which a dose is delayed in this manner for issues related to the COVID -19 pandemic, the Medical Mon itor should be informed as soon as possible, but prior consultation is not required unless the dose cannot be administered within the 8 -week delay, then the Medical Monitor must be consulted . In all cases, the dose should be administered as close as possi ble to the scheduled timepoint. If a dose is delayed, all assessments associated with the originally scheduled dose may also be delayed to coincide with the delayed dose. During the Treatment Period, every effort should be made to avoid missed doses of ALN -TTRSC02. During the Treatment Period, if a patient misses a dose for reasons unrelated to the COVID -19 pandemic, the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, will discuss whether the patient will be able to continue in the study (see also Section 4.3). 5.2.2.2. Patisiran Patisiran 0.3 mg/kg IV infusion will be administered once every 3 weeks (q3w) ±3 days. The amount (in mg) of study drug to b e administered should be determined based on the patient's weight (kg). Dosing is based on actual body weight. For patients weighing ≥ 100 kg, the maximum recommended dose is 30 mg. If a patient has tolerated at least 2 doses of patisiran administered in the clinic, dosing may be administered outside the study site (eg, the patient’s home) at all timepoints where allowed by applicable country and local regulations. In these cases, dosing should be administered by a trained healthcare professional, with ove rsight by the Investigator."
150,page_150,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 (vutrisiran) Amendment 4, 19 February 2021 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 60 Required premedication for patients in the patisiran arm All patients should receive premedication prior to patisiran administration to reduce the risk of infusion -related reactions (IRRs). Each of the following medicinal products should be given on the day of patisiran infusion at least 60 minutes prior to the start of infusion: • Intravenous corticosteroid (dexamethasone 10 mg, or equivalent) • Oral paracetamol (500 mg) • Intravenous H1 blocker (diphenhydramine 50 mg, or equiva lent) • Intravenous H2 blocker (ranitidine 50 mg, or equivalent) Oral premedication equivalents are permitted, but must be administered in the presence of a healthcare professional. Modifications to lower the corticosteroid dose may be made to the premedi cation regimen for either of the following 2 reasons: 1. If a patient is having difficulty tolerating the corticosteroid premedication regimen (eg, patient develops uncontrolled hyperglycemia, altered mental status, or other complication), then lowering of th e corticosteroid premedication may be allowed for that patient after consultation with the medical monitor. 2. If a patient has tolerated 3 or more infusions of patisiran with their current corticosteroid premedication regimen (ie, patient has not had IRRs during the past 3 or more infusions), then lowering of the corticosteroid premedication is recommended. Steps to lower corticosteroid dosing are provided in the Study Manual. Corticosteroid tapering may be performed in the clinic or, at the discretion o f the investigator, may be performed outside of the clinic (eg, in the patient’s home) after consultation with the Medical Monitor. Additional or higher doses of one or more of the premedications may be administered to reduce the risk of IRRs, if needed. Guidelines for management of IRRs can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. Method of Administration of patisiran Patisiran is for IV use and should be administered by a healthcare professional. Weight from previous visit may be used for calculating dose. W eight must be collected predose. The patient’s infusion site should be assessed for signs of any localized reaction during the infusion and for 30 minutes after the end of the infusion. The patient should be observed for 1 hour following completion of dosi ng for observation and completion of assessments. Detailed instructions for study drug preparation and administration can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. Missed Doses of patisiran If a patient does not receive a dose of patisiran within the dosing window (±3 days) due to the COVID -19 pandemic , the dose may be administered with up to 7 days delay after the scheduled visit, after consultation with the Medical Monitor (to be considered a delayed dose). If a dose is administered with a delay, the next dose wi ll resume following the original schedule per the"

In all cases, the dose should be administered as close as possible to the scheduled time point. If a dose is delayed, all assessments associated with the originally scheduled dose m ay also be delayed to coincide with the delayed dose. A dose will be considered completed if 80% or more of the total volume of the IV solution has been administered to the patient. Patients will be permitted to miss an occasional dose of study drug. How ever, if a patient misses 2 consecutive doses for reasons unrelated to the COVID -19 pandemic, the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, will discuss whether the patient will be able to continue in the study. 5.2.2.3. Switching from Patisiran to A LN-TTRSC02 After Month 18 After the Treatment Period, p atients in the patisiran arm will switch to ALN -TTRSC02 treatment Patients who enter the Legacy Treatmen t Extension Period (as of Amendment 4) will receive the 25 mg q3M dose and complete visits in the Legacy Treatment Extension Period . If a patient receiving patisiran is unable to complete the Month 18 efficacy visit at the study center due to the COVID -19 pandemic before Week 84 they may transition to treatment with ALN -TTRSC02 at Week 84 ; the patient should still complete the Month 18 efficacy assessment as soon as possible (see also Section 3.1). 5.2.3. LFT Criteria for Wi thholding, Monitoring and Stopping ALN -TTRSC02 Dosing 1. For the ALN -TTRSC02 cohort, dosing decisions may be made based on LFT results (Table 8) collected at the previous dosing visit (up to 14 weeks prior to dosing); in all cases the most recently available LFTs should be used. All laboratory samples should be sent to the central l aboratory; an exception is for situations related to the COVID -19 pandemic if central laboratory collection is not possible, then a local laboratory may be used. These local laboratory results must be sent to the site for review by the Investigator and en try into the clinical database. 2. For any ALT or AST elevation >3× ULN, central laboratory results should be used to guide subsequent monitoring as detailed in Table 7. 3. For any ALT or AST elevation >3× ULN: a. Confirm using central laboratory, as soon as possible, ideally within 2 to 3 days, but no later than 7 days.

Birth control methods which are considered highly effective include : • Placement of an intrauterine device. • Placement of an intrauterine hormone -releasing system. • Bilateral tubal occlusion. • Surgical sterilization of male partner (with the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate; for female patients on the study, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that patient). • Established use of oral (except for low dose gestagens), implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormon al methods of contraception associated with the inhibition of ovulation. • True sexual abstinence, when in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception. Abstinent patients must agree to use one of the above -mentioned contraceptive methods, if they start heterosexual relationships during the study and for up to 90 days after the last dose of study dru g. Investigators should advise females of childbearing potential of the most appropriate birth control method available within their country taking into account local medical practice. Females of child -bearing potential include female patients who have exp erienced menarche (or begin menarche over the course of the study) and who are not postmenopausal or permanently sterilized (eg, bilateral tubal occlusion, hysterectomy, or bilateral salpingectomy). A postmenopausal state is defined as the absence of mens es for 12 months without an alternative medical cause, confirmed by follicle stimulating hormone level within the postmenopausal range. For male patients, no contraception is required. However, contraception use by males should be consistent with local r egulations as described in the corresponding patient informed consent forms. Compliance with contraception requirements will be assessed on a regular basis by the Investigator throughout the course of the study (see Section 6.5.6.2 ). 5.6.2. Alcohol Restrictions Patients will limit alcohol consumption throughout the course of the study. Alcohol is limited to no more than 2 units per day (unit: 1 glass of win e [approximately 125 mL] = 1 measure of spirits [approximately 1 fluid ounce] = ½ pint of beer [approximately 284 mL]) for the duration of the study."

STUDY ASSESSMENTS The schedule of study assessments is provided in Table 1 (Screening through Treatment Period Month 9), Table 2 (Treatment Period from Month 9 through Month 18) , Table 3 (Legacy Treatment Extension Period , Early Drug Discontinuation, and Other Visits ), Table 4 (Randomized Treatment Extension Period), Table 5 (ALN -TTRSC02 PK Time Points) and Table 6 (Patisiran PK Time Points). Additional information on the collection of study assessments will be detailed in the Study Reference Manual. In this study there are 2 types of study centers: • Patient Care Sites (PCS) can screen, dose, and manage the well -being of patients and collect safety assessments, and can administer efficacy assessments that include, but are not limited to, completion of a questionnaire or collection of blood samples for assessment of TTR and other PD biomarkers, as well as cardiac biomarkers, but will not perfor m the following efficacy assessments: NIS, mNIS+7, HRdb, 10 -MWT, FAP and PND, KPS, echocardiogram. • Central Assessment Sites (CAS) can perform all efficacy assessments and perform the same assessments as at a PCS (as stated above). Efficacy assessments (N IS, mNIS+7, HRdb, 10 -MWT, FAP and PND, KPS, echocardiogram) in this study may require special training as described further in Section 6.2; therefor e, all patients must be sent to a CAS to collect these efficacy assessments during screening and predose baseline assessments , Month 9 and Month 18 of the Treatment Period and the RTE Period , and modified efficacy visits for patients who discontinue early during the Treatment Period . Where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure allow, routine assessments may be performed outside of the study center (eg, the patient’s home) by a trained healthcare professional at all timepoints. These a ssessments include the following: vital signs, physical exam, weight, ECGs, pregnancy tests, urine collection, blood draws (clinical laboratory assessments, ADA, PK; ATTR/vitamin A; exploratory samples), collection of information regarding vital status, ho spitalizations, urgent care visits, procedures, and concomitant medications. All laboratory samples should be sent to the central laboratory; an exception is for situations related to the COVID -19 pandemic if central laboratory assessments are not possibl e, then a local laboratory may be used. These local lab results must be sent to the site for review by the Investigator and entry into the clinical database. Wherever possible, AE collection associated with visits outside of the clinic will be collected b y qualified site staff through verbal contact with the patient. With the exception of patients unable to come to the site due to the COVID -19 pandemic limiting the patient’s ability or willingness to access the study center, at a minimum, patients must vis it the site for scheduled dosing and assessments at the Treatment Period Week 12 and Week 60 visits within the study visit windows and for efficacy assessments as detailed below. If any study assessments are not able to be completed at the site or at home within the study visit window, the study physician (or delegate) must, at a minimum, verbally contact the patient within the expected window for each study visit to collect releva nt safety information (including, but not limited to, AEs, concomitant medications, hospitalizations/procedures, and vital status)."
157,page_157,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 (vutrisiran) Amendment 4, 19 February 2021 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 67 All efficacy visits must be conducted at the clinic (Month 9, Month 18, , and modified efficacy vis its for those who discontinue early during the Treatment Period ). In situations in which a n efficacy visit is unable to be completed due to the COVID -19 pandemic limiting the patient’s ability or willingness to access the study center or their ability to receive their scheduled doses of study drug, the Medical Monitor should be consulted as soon as possible to determine the appropriate timing of the efficacy assessment. After consultation with the Medical Monitor, efficacy assessments may be completed wit hin 6 months after the intended time point (ie, up to Month 15 or Month 24) during the Treatment Period as necessary . Further details regarding visits performed outside of the clinic are provided in the Study Reference Manual. 6.1. Scree ning Assessments See Table 1 for a list of Screening visit assessments. An informed consent form (ICF) or assent form that has been approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) must be signed by the patient (or legal guardian) before the Screening procedures are initiated (Table 1) and before any procedures are performed in the RTE Period ( Table 4). All patients (or their legal guardians) will be given a copy of the signed and dated ICF and/or assent form. In addition of the ICF, patients will be asked to sign a Medical Records Release Form (where allowed by local regulations) at Screening for the purpose of obtaining information on vital status, cardiac transplant procedures, left -ventricular assist device plac ement (Section 6.2.8 ), and hospitalizations (Section 6.2.7 ) from patients for the duration of the study. This information will be obtained by the patient’s physician through contacting the patient or family or from death registries. Signing the Medi cal Records Release Form will be optional and will apply if the patient discontinues from the study early. Every effort should be made to collect the Medical Records Release Form from all patients enrolled in the study. Also see Section 4.3.2.1 for the collection of vital status after withdrawal of consent and Section 4.3.3 for patients who are lost to follow - up. Patients will complete the following 3 visit types prior to randomization for the Treatment Period : the ICF and Medical Records Release Form will be obtained at the Visit 1 (Screening), and all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assessed except for the NIS and PND score criteria; see Section 4.1); the NIS and PND score inclusion crite ria will be assessed at Visit 2 (Baseline first assessment); other baseline assessments will be completed at Visit 3 or at Day 1 prior to first dose. Visits 1, 2 and 3 may each occur over multiple days. 6.1.1. Retesting If screening laboratory abnormalities, i n the Investigator’s judgement, are felt likely to be transient, then the laboratory tests may be repeated. The Investigator’s rationale should be documented. Laboratory values can be retested once during screening provided that the patient can be evaluat ed for eligibility and randomized within the allowed Screening period. Qualifying LFTs (AST, ALT and bilirubin) are an exception to this rule and may not be repeated."

Rescreening For patients who do not meet all study eligibility requirements, due to a transient clinical condition during screening or who fail to complete screening activities due to unforeseen and unavoidable circumstances, rescreening once may be permitted after consultation with the Medical Monitor after a minimum of 5 days have elapsed from a patient’s last screening assessment. In this case, a patient will be re -consented and all screening procedures must be repeated. 6.1.3. Demographic and Medical History/Disease History Medical history will be collected during screening Visit 1 (including any cardiac disorders, any eye disorders or previous ophthalmology test results, and prior medications). Documented technetium scintigraphy and/or tissue biopsy testing for amyloidosis performed prior to study enrollment should be collected and recorded a s part of medical history. Information on prior use of tetramer stabilizers at any time prior to first dose should be collected and recorded. Information on other prior medications, hospitalization, and procedures through 1 year prior to first dose should be collected and recorded. At screening Visit 2 and Visit 3, only additional medical history changes since Visit 1 will be collected. Also, technetium scintigraphy scans and/or tissue biopsy testing for amyloidosis performed as part of clinical care during the study should be collected and recorded as part of concomitant procedure information. 6.2. Efficacy Assessments See the beginning of Section 6 for p rocedures to follow in situations in which a n efficacy visit is unable to be completed due to the COVID -19 pandemic limiting the patient’s ability or willingness to access the study center. 6.2.1.

A Computer Aided Sensory Evaluator (CASE) IV device will be used for this assessment. • Postural blood pressure will be measured to assess autonomic function as described in the Study Manual . Points are assigned based on the change in blood pressure with standing. A summary of the scoring of the components of the mNIS+7 is provided in Section 10.1. 6.2.1.2. Neurologic Impairment Score (NIS) The NIS assessment is a 244 -point composite measure of neurologic impairment which includes a physical exam of lower limbs, upper limbs and cranial nerves to assess motor strength/weakness and determine the fol lowing component scores: • NIS-W • NIS-R • NIS-sensation (NIS -S) 6.2.1.3. Personnel and Procedures to Ensure Quality and Consistency of NIS and mNIS+7 Scoring The NIS and mNIS+7 will be evaluated at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 4). The NIS -W and NIS -R assessments obtained for NIS calculation do not need to be repeated for the mNIS+7 calculation. As per the Schedule of Assessments for the 18-month Treatment Period , 2 independent assessments will be performed on separate days (1 assessment on each day); the 2 assessments should be performed approximately 24 hours apart from each other but not more than 7 days apart. Each site should make every effort to have these asses sments performed by the same assessor. NIS and QST assessments will be performed by certified staff trained on the u se of the CASE IV device. NCS studies will be performed by trained staff. Study personnel performing the mNIS+7 component assessments will not reference the results of any previous assessments. All site staff performing the mNIS+7 will be trained and ce rtified by the peripheral neuropathy laboratory at the , USA. The peripheral neuropathy laboratory at the also serves as the central laboratory that will assess the mNIS+7 score. All data will be transmitted to the wher e qualified personnel will assess the quality and acceptability of all test scores.

This assessment will be performed by a certified trained staff during the Treatment Period at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 3). The average heart rate difference while taking eight deep breaths will be m easured using a CASE IV device. As per the Schedule of Assessments, 2 independent assessments will be performed on separate days (1 assessment on each day); the 2 assessments should be performed approximately 24 hours apart from each other but not more t han 7 days apart. Each site should make every effort to have this assessment performed by the same assessor. 6.2.3. Norfolk Quality of Life -Diabetic Neuropathy (Norfolk QoL -DN) The Norfolk QoL -DN questionnaire is a standardized 35 -item patient -reported outcomes measure that assesses 5 domains: physical function, large fiber neuropathy, activities of daily living, symptoms, small fiber neuropathy, and autonomic neuropathy. The total score ranges from -4 (best possible quality of life) to 136 points (worst possibl e quality of life) [Vinik 2005 ; Vinik 2014 ]. The Norfolk QoL -DN questionnaire will be completed at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 4). 6.2.4. Ten-meter Walk Test (10 -MWT) The time it takes for a patient to walk 10 meters (gait speed) will be assessed at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 4). The 10-MWT will be performed and recorded following procedures outlined in the Study Reference Manual. The test must be completed without assistance from another person; ambulatory aids such as canes and walkers are permitted. As per the Schedule of Assessments for the 18-month Treatment Period , 2 independent assessments are to be performed approximately 24 hours apart from each other but not more than 7 days apart. Each site should make every effort to have this assessment pe rformed by the same assessor. 6.2.5. Modified Body Mass Index (mBMI) The nutritional status of patients is evaluated using the mBMI; calculated as the product of body mass index (BMI) (weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) and serum albumin (g/L). Weight, height, and serum albumin (collected as part of the serum chemistry panel) will be collected at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 4). The site will not perform the calculation for mBMI. 6.2.6. Rasch -built Overall Disability Scale (R -ODS) An assessment of the disability each patient experiences will be assessed through the R -ODS questionnaire at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 4)."

Deaths and Hospitalizations All deaths and hospitalizations will be recorded at Day 1 post dose and throughout the study as specified as part of adverse events (AEs) monitoring (see Section 6.5.7 ) according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 4). Reason for deaths will be adjudicated by an Independent Clinical Adjudication Committee (see Section 3.8). 6.2.8. Vital Status Check Vital status checks will be performed at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1 to Table 4). Vital status checks should include checking for the occurrence of heart transplantation or left -ventricular assist device implantation procedures. Also see Section 4.3.2.1 for the collection of vital status after withdrawal of consent and Section 4.3.3 for patients who are lost to follow -up. 6.2.9. European Quality of Life -5 Dimensions 5 -Levels (EQ -5D-5L) and EQ -Visual Analog Scale (EQ -VAS) The EQ -5D index score is based on the response to questions evaluating 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension scored is based on 5 possible levels where level 1 reflects the best possi ble score for that dimension. As an example, the 5 levels for the dimension of self -care include: level 1: no problems with washing or dressing self, level 2: slight problems, level 3: moderate problems, level 4: severe problems, level 5: unable. The EQ -5D index score is derived based on scores from all 5 dimensions; score range is from 0 (worst QoL) to 1 (best QoL). The EQ -VAS is a single question evaluating the patient’s own global impression of their overall health and is evaluated on a scale of 0 (w orst possible health) to 100 (best possible health). The EQ -5D-5L and EQ -VAS questionnaire will be completed at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 4). 6.2.10. PND Score and FAP Stage Ambulation and changes in disease stage will be evaluated through physician assessment of PND score and FAP stage [Coutinho 1980 ; Yamamoto 2007 ].

Vital Signs Vital signs will be measured as specified at the timepoints specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 4), and include blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and respiratory rate. Vital signs will be measured predose, when applicable. When vital signs and blood sample collection occur at the same time, vital signs should be performed before blood samples are drawn, where possible. Vital signs should be measured predose in the seated or supine position, after the patient has rested comfortably for 10 minutes. Blood pressure should be take n using the same arm during a single visit. Body temperature in degrees Celsius will be obtained via oral, tympanic, or axillary methods. Heart rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in beats per minute, and respiration rate will be counted for a full minute and recorded in breaths per minute. Additional vital sign assessments, as medially indicated, may be added at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice (as applicable). Vital signs results will be recorded in the eCRF. 6.5.2. Weig ht and Height Height will be measured in centimeters. Body weight will be measured in kilograms. Height and body weight measurements will be collected at the timepoints specified in in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 4) and will be recorded in the eCRF. For patients on the patisiran arm , weight must be collected prior to each dose. 6.5.3. Physical Examination Full and symptom -directed physical examinations will be conducted according to the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 4); if a physical examination is scheduled for a dosing visit, it should be conducted prior to dosing. Full physical examinations will include the examination of the following: general appeara nce; head, eyes, ears, nose and throat; respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and dermatological systems; thyroid; lymph nodes; and neurological status. Symptom -directed physical examinations will be guided by evaluation of change s in symptoms, or the onset of new symptoms, since the last visit. In situations where the patient has a home visit, symptom -directed physical examinations may be deferred until the next in -clinic visit . Clinically significant abnormalities observed durin g the physical examination are recorded on the medical history or AE eCRF. 6.5.4. Electrocardiogram A 12 -lead ECG reporting rhythm, ventricular rate, RR interval, PR interval, QRS duration, and QT interval will be obtained locally as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 4). Triplicate readings should be performed at Baseline and thereafter single readings can be performed."

Patients should be supine for at least 5 minutes before each ECG is obtained. When ECG and blood sample collection occur at the same time, ECGs should be performed before blood samples are drawn. The Inv estigator or qualified designee will review all ECGs, including those collected by a healthcare professional outside of the study center, to assess whether the results have changed since baseline and to determine the clinical significance of the results. Additional ECGs may be collected at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per DMC advice. ECG recordings will be archived according to the Study Reference Manual. 6.5.5. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS) The Columbia –Suicide Severity Rating Sc ale (C -SSRS) will be used to assess patient’s mental status as it relates to suicidal ideation and behavior. This questionnaire will be administered to the patient by trained and certified study personnel. The C -SSRS will be performed as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 4). 6.5.6. Clinical Laboratory Assessments Clinical laboratory assessments are listed in Table 8 will be collected as specified in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 1 to Table 4) and should be evaluated by a central laboratory. Clinical laboratory assessments may be collected at the clinical study center or outside the clinic (eg, the patient’s home) by a trained healthcare professional within the study visit window as described at the beginning of Section 6. For the ALN -TTRSC02 arm, ALN -TTRSC02 dosing decisions may be made based on LFT results ( Table 8) collected at the previous dosing visit (up to 14 weeks prior to dosing); in all cases the most recently available LFTs should be used. Specific instructions for transaminase elevations are provided in S ection 5.2.3 . While local laboratory results may be used for urgent clinical and dosing decisions, on the day of the assessments, all laboratory ass essments specified in Table 8 which are performed at the clinic or outside the study center (eg, the patient’s home) should also be sent in parallel to the central laboratory. In the case of discrepant local and central laboratory results on samples drawn on the same day, central laboratory results will be relied upon for clinical and dosing decisions. The only excepti on for central laboratory testing is related to the COVID -19 pandemic as described in the beginning of Section 6. For the patisiran arm, LFTs should be performed according to patisiran visit windows and do not need to be available prior to dosing. For any other unexplained clinically relevant abnormal laboratory test occurring after study drug administration, the test should be repeated and followed up at the discretion of the Investigator, or as per the Medical Monitor or DMC advice, until it has returned to the normal range or stabilized, and/or a diagnosis is made to adequately explain the abnormality.

Definitions Adverse Event According to the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E2A guideline Definitions and Standards for Expedited Reporting, and 21 CFR 312.32, IND Safety Reporting, an adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigationa l subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. Serious Adverse Event A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: • Results in death • Is life -threatening (an event which places the patient at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred. It does not include an event that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death) • Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization • Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity • Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect • Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardi ze the patient and may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions, or the d evelopment of drug dependency or abuse) Adverse Events of Clinical Interest The following are considered to be AEs of clinical interest: • Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) >3× upper limit of normal (ULN) • Severe or serious i njection site reactions (ISRs), ISRs that are associated with a recall phenomenon (reaction at the site of a prior injection with subsequent injections), recurrent ISRs that are increasing in severity, or ISRs that lead to temporary dose interruption or pe rmanent discontinuation of ALN -TTRSC02 • An ISR is defined as a local reaction at or near the site of injection. “At or near” the injection site includes reactions at the injection site, adjacent to the injection site, or a reaction which may shift slightly away from the injection site due to gravity (eg, as may occur with swelling or hematoma). A systemic reaction which includes the injection site (eg, generalized urticaria, other distinct entities or conditions like lymphadenopathy that may be near the in jection site) is not considered an ISR"

Adverse Event Severity Adverse events are to be graded according to the categories detailed below: Mild: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. Moderate: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (eg, preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money). Severe: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living (ie, bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden); OR life - threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated; OR death related to an adverse event. Changes in severity should be docu mented in the medical record to allow assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity. Adverse events characterized as intermittent require documentation of the start and stop of each incidence. When changes in the severity of an AE occ ur more frequently than once a day, the maximum severity for the experience that day should be noted. If the severity category changes over a number of days, then those changes should be recorded separately (with distinct onset dates). AE severity and ser iousness are assessed independently. ‘Severity’ characterizes the intensity of an AE. ‘Serious’ is a regulatory definition and serves as a guide to the Sponsor for defining regulatory reporting obligations (see definition for SAE). Relationship of the Ad verse Event to Study Drug The relationship of each AE to study drug should be evaluated by the Investigator by a “yes” or “no” response to the question: “Is there a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drug?” 6.5.7.2. Eliciting an d Recording Adverse Events Eliciting Adverse Events The patient and legal guardian, if applicable, should be asked about medically relevant changes in his/her health since the last visit. The patient should also be asked if he/she has been hospitalized, h ad any accidents, used any new medications, or changed concomitant medication routines (both prescription and OTC). In addition to patient observations, AEs will be documented from any clinically relevant laboratory findings, physical examination findings , ECG changes, or other findings that are relevant to patient safety. Recording Adverse Events The Investigator is responsible for recording non -serious AEs that are observed or reported by the patient after administration of the first dose of study drug r egardless of their relationship to study drug through the end of study. Non -serious AEs will be followed until the end of study."

The Investigator is responsible for recording SAEs that are observed or reported by the patient after the time when the informed consent is signed regardless of their relationship to study drug through the end of study. SAEs will be followed unt il satisfactory resolution, until baseline level is reached, or until the SAE is considered by the Investigator to be chronic or the patient is stable, as appropriate. For patients who discontinue study drug early and remain in the study, all AEs will be c ollected for 90 days after the last dose, thereafter, SAEs and AEs of clinical interest (see definition in Section 6.5.7.1 ) will be collected for th e remainder of their participation in the study. All AEs must be recorded in the source records for the clinical study center and in the eCRF for the patient, whether or not they are considered to be drug -related. Each AE must be described in detail: ons et time and date, description of event, severity, relationship to study drug, action taken, and outcome (including time and date of resolution, if applicable). For SAEs, record the event(s) in the eCRF and, as applicable, the SAE form. For AEs that are co nsidered AEs of clinical interest (Section 6.5.7.1 ), the Sponsor or its designee should complete the supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF. Ad ditional clinical and laboratory information may be collected. Refer to CRF completion guidelines for details on reporting events in the supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF. For all ISRs, the Investigator, or delegate, should submit an Injection Site Reaction Signs or Symptoms eCRF, recording additional information regarding each injection site reaction that is entered on the AE eCRF (eg, symptom(s), injection site location, follow -up actions taken, etc.). If patients develop ocular symptoms suggestive of vitamin A deficiency, for example reduced night vision or night blindness, the Investigator should consult with the Medical Monitor to determine if an ophthalmological assessment is needed. Any information collected during an ophthalmologica l assessment should be recorded in the eCRF and reports or images of ophthalmological assessments should be collected as well. 6.5.7.3. Reporting Adverse Events of Clinical Interest to Sponsor/Designee For AEs that are considered AEs of clinical interest (Section 6.5.7.1 ), the Sponsor or its designee should be notified within 24 hours using a supplemental AEs of Clinical Interest eCRF. 6.5.7.4. Serious Adverse Events R equire Immediate Reporting to Sponsor/Designee An assessment of the seriousness of each AE will be made by the Investigator. Any AE and laboratory abnormality that meets the SAE criteria in Section 6.5.7.1 must be reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours from the time that clinical study center staff first learns of the event.

Biomarkers, DNA Genotyping, and Biospecimen Repository Alnylam’s RNAi therapeutics platform permits the highly specific targeting of investigational therapies based on genetic sequence. It is possible that variations in the target genetic sequence will result in variations in drug effect. More generally, genetic variations may account for the well -described heterogeneous manifestations of disease in patients with hATTR amyloidosis, as well as their responses to treatment. Where allowed per local regulations, ethics committee (IRB/EC) approval, and patient consent (and assent, where applicable), samples will be collected as part of this study to permit exploratory investigations and the application of novel approaches to bioanalyses that may furthe r elucidate the outcomes of this study, or potentially advance understanding of the safety, mechanism of action, and/or efficacy of ALN -TTRSC02 and patisiran . Biological specimens will be collected at the intervals indicated in the Schedule of Assessment s (Table 1 through Table 6). Potential exploratory investigations may include DNA, RNA, or biochemical metabolite assessments as they relate to disease progression, efficacy or safety. The biospecimen repository will also include residual material from routine samples (safety laboratory samples, PK samples, etc.) that are obtained during the study. These specimens will be securely stored in a central biorepository for up to 10 years following the completion of this clinical study (ie, last patient last visit), or as per local regul ations. After 10 years have elapsed, samples will be destroyed. Details regarding the collection, processing, storage, and shipping of the samples will be provided in the Laboratory Manual.

Determination of Sample Size Approximately 160 patients will be enrolled in this study, with a 3:1 randomization ratio to either ALN -TTRSC02 or patisiran. The sample size was chosen to enable an adequate characterization of the long -term safety profile, as well as the efficacy of ALN -TTRSC02 in this patient population. For the primary efficacy endpoint of mNIS+7 and the key secondary endpoint of Norfolk QoL -DN total scores, the ALN -TTRSC02 arm in the Phase 3 study will be compared to the placebo arm from the APOLLO study. For the mNIS+7 change from baseline at 9 months, the observed mean (±standard deviation [SD]) was 15 ± 17 points for the placebo arm from t he APOLLO study. Assuming a mean change of 0 points for the ALN -TTRSC02 arm, there is >90% power to establish the superiority over placebo using a 2 -sided t -test with a significance level of 0.05. For the Norfolk -QoL DN total score change from baseline a t 9 months, the observed mean (±SD) was 11.5 ± 19.2 points for the placebo arm from the APOLLO study. Assuming a mean change of -4 points for the ALN -TTRSC02 arm, there is >90% power to establish the superiority over placebo using a 2 -sided t -test with a significance level of 0.05. For safety, a sample size of >100 patients on ALN -TTRSC02 can provide reasonable assurance that the true cumulative one -year incidence of adverse drug events (ADE) is no greater than 3% when no ADE is observed. To match the ca rdiac disease severity with the APOLLO study population, the study plans to enroll no more than 15% of patients with NT -proBNP values greater than 3000 ng/L. 7.2. Statistical Methodology Additional data summaries to help understand any impact of the COVID -19 pa ndemic and any descriptive comparison of on efficacy , PD and safety assessments will be outlined in the SAP. 7.2.1.

Sensitivity analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint of mNIS+7 and the key secondary endpoint of Norfolk QoL -DN total scores , including different methods for handling of the missing data, will be conducted to assess the robustness of the primary analysis results. More details of missing data handling will be described in the SAP. 7.2.4. Baseline Evaluations Demographics and other baseline characteristics, including disease -specific information, will be summarized descriptively. 7.2.5. Efficacy Analyses This Phase 3 stud y will use the placebo arm of the APOLLO study as an external control. Patient -level data from this study will be compared with patient -level data from APOLLO for efficacy analyses. For the primary and secondary clinical efficacy endpoints, the ALN - TTRSC 02 arm in this study will be compared to the placebo arm from the APOLLO study. For the secondary endpoint of TTR percent reduction, the ALN -TTRSC02 arm in this study will be compared to the patisiran arm in this study. The treatment comparison will be co nducted at Month 9 and/or Month 18. The efficacy endpoints beyond 18 months will be summarized descriptively. The patisiran arm in this study will mainly serve as a reference arm. For the clinical efficacy endpoints at Month 9 and Month 18 , the patisiran arm will be summarized descriptively and the treatment difference between ALN -TTRSC02 and patisiran arm in this study will not be tested. 7.2.5.1. Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint mNIS+7 will compare change in mNIS+7 from baseline at Month 9 between the ALN -TTRSC02 group in this study and the placebo group in the APOLLO study. The treatment effect will be estimated based on the least squares (LS) means using an analysis of"

The primary endpoint will be tested at a significance level of 0.05 and must be significant to declare a positive trial. Primary endpoint data that are missing will be multiply imputed separately for each treatment group using a regression procedure based on baseline covariates. The detail s will be specified in the SAP. The mNIS+7 score for the patisiran group in this study will be summarized descriptively. 7.2.5.2. Secondary Endpoints For the secondary clinical efficacy endpoints, the treatment comparison will be made between the ALN -TTRSC02 group in this study and the placebo group in the APOLLO study at Month 9 or Month 18 as specified. For the TTR percent reduction endpoint, the ALN -TTRSC02 group will be compared with the patisiran group in this study. To control the overall type I error, the secondary endpoints will be tested in the following hierarchical order : • Norfolk QoL -DN total score change from baseline at Month 9 • 10-MWT gait speed change from baseline at Month 9 • mNIS+7 change from baseline at Month 18 • Norfolk QoL -DN total score change from baseline at Month 18 • 10-MWT gait speed change from baseline at Month 18 • mBMI (BMI [kg/m2] multiplied by serum albumin level [g/L]) change from baseline at Month 18 • R-ODS change from baseline at Month 18 • TTR percent reduction through 18 months For cha nge in Norfolk QoL -DN total score and 10 -MWT gait speed from baseline at Month 9, the analysis will be based on an ANCOVA model similar to the model described for the analysis of change in mNIS+7 from baseline at Month 9, while adjusting for baseline value of the endpoint being modeled and including baseline NIS score (<50 vs ≥50) as an additional factor in the model. For these 2 endpoints, data that are missing will be multiply imputed separately for each treatment group using a regression procedure based on baseline covariates. The details will be specified in the SAP. For change from baseline at Month 18 analyses, the analysis will be based on a mixed -effects model for repeated measures (MMRM), adjusting for a covariate (baseline value for the endpoint being modeled), categorical factors (treatment group, visit [Month 9 vs Month 18], genotype, age of disease onset, baseline NIS score), and an interaction term (treatment group by visit). For mNIS+7, baseline NIS score will not be included in the model. In the APOLLO study, mBMI was not assessed at Month 9 or Month 18. The average values of Day 189 and Day 357 will be derived a s Month 9, and the Day 546 value will be substituted as Month 18."

A Hodges -Lehmann method stratified by previous TTR stabilizer use (yes vs no) will be used to estimate the 95% CI for the median di fference between the ALN -TTRSC02 and patisiran groups in this study. Non -inferiority will be declared if the lower limit of the 95% CI for the treatment difference is greater than –10%. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted to compare the TTR percent re duction between the ALN -TTRSC02 group from this study and the pooled patisiran groups from this Phase 3 study and the APOLLO study. 7.2.5.3. Exploratory Endpoints Analysis of exploratory efficacy endpoints will be detailed in the SAP. 7.2.6. Pharmacodynamic Analysis Summary tables and graphical displays of observed values, changes and percentage changes from baseline in PD biomarkers (TTR and vitamin A) will be presented. 7.2.7. Pharmacokinetic Analysis Pharmacokinetic analyses will be conducted for ALN -TTRSC02 and patisiran using non - compartmental method. PK parameters will be calculated using a validated version of Phoenix® WinNonlin. Population pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed to describe the plasma pharmacokinetics using Phoenix NLME (Version 1.1 or later) or a similar software, such as NONMEM. The impact of relevant covariates, such as, weight, sex, race, age, renal function, and hepatic function on plasma PK will be evaluated. Summary tables and figures and inferential statistics will be generated. 7.2.8. Safety Analy ses A summary of study drug exposure, including the durations of exposure and the proportions of patients with dose modifications will be produced. Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary. Results will be tabulated by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC) and Preferred Term. Adverse events will be summarized by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term. The number and percentage of patients experiencing AEs after th e first dose of the study drug will be summarized. Separate tabulations will be produced for treatment -related AEs, SAEs, and discontinuations due to AEs. By -patient listings will be provided for deaths, SAEs, and events leading to discontinuation of trea tment. Descriptive statistics will be provided for clinical laboratory data, 12 -lead ECG interval data and vital signs data, presented as both actual values and changes from baseline over time Laboratory shift tables from baseline to worst values will be p resented.

After the Week 36 dose (last dose prior to the Month 9 efficacy assessments), patients will be transitioned from vial -based injections to the pre -filled syringes as this presentation becomes avai lable. Several additional changes are being implemented as outlined below. The following secondary objective/endpoint has been added:  A new objective has been added to determine the efficacy of ALN -TTRSC02 on improvement in neurologic impairment and qualit y of life. This will be assessed by analyzing the change at Month 18 compared to baseline in mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DN total score in ALN -TTRSC02 -treated patients. A Medical Records Release form has been added:  All p atients will be asked to sign a n optiona l Medical Records Release Form (where allowed by local regulations) in addition to the informed consent form. This form will ensure collection of vital status data , cardiac transplant procedures, left -ventricular assist device placement, and hospitalizations from patients who discontinue early from the study. The following additional assessment timepoints or clarification have been made to the Schedule of Assessments :  Vital status assessments have been added to reflect collection of this information at every visit throughout the study.  Collection of Polyneuropathy Disability (PND) score and Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (FAP) stage assessments at the Month 9 efficac y visit to ensure consistency in the timing of the collection of disease stage information with the ALN - TTR02 -004 (APOLLO) study.  Clarified the timing of hepatitis tests, exploratory biomarkers (urine, plasma, serum), optional exploratory DNA sample, and p harmacoeconomic assessments (Patient and Caregiver Impact Survey; Patient Experience Survey; Patient Preference Survey)  Added an additional check of serum TTR and vitamin A at Week 42.  Clarified that treatment administration and efficacy visits during the Extension Period at Month 27 and Month 36 are expected to be distinct visits, consistent with the"

Also clarified the safety assessments to be conducted at the administration and efficacy visits.  Added a clarificatio n to indicate the predose and postdose patisiran pharmacokinetic blood draws will be timed based on the start and end of patisiran infusion.  Clarified that that LFTs must be obtained with results available within 28 days before the clinic visit on which AL N-TTRSC02 dosing is scheduled during treatment from Month 9 to Month 18 and during the treatment extension period. Additional protocol modifications or clarifications have been added for the following:  The study design description was updated to clarify that the Sponsor will be making efforts to enroll a population in this study that is comparable to the APOLLO study population to enable robust cross -study comparisons.  Under female contraception requirem ents, clarified that use of oral, implantable, injectable, or transdermal hormonal methods of contraception must be associated with the inhibition of ovulation.  When recording medical history, clarified that information on prior tetramer stabilizer use anytime should be recorded and not only the use within the 1 year prior to the first dose of study drug.  Clarified that follicle -stimulating hormone testing will be performed in all post - menopausal women to confirm suspected post -menopausal status.  Additional requirements for study termination were implemented in line with ICH E6 (R2) Guideline, and the publication policy details were updated to match language in the Clinical Trial Agreement.  Added the international non -proprietary name (INN), vutrisiran, of the drug product ALN -TTRSC02; updated the comparator name “patisiran -LNP” to “patisiran” throughout the protocol.  Rescreening criteria limited previously to LFT and NIS eligibility requirements have broadened to allow more flexibility.

RATIONALE FOR PROTOC OL AMENDMENT The purpose of this protocol amendment is to incorporate Urgent Safety Measures (USMs) that were communicated to investigators in a Dear Investigator Letter dated 31 March 2020 to assure the safety of study participants while minimizing risks to study integrity amid the COVID -19 pandemic. These changes were to be immediately adopted by the investigator site per the Dear Investigator Letter dated 31 Mar ch 2020 and are in line with guidance from both the European Medicines Agency and the United States Food and Drug Administration on the conduct of clinical trials during the COVID -19 pandemic. [EMA 2020; FDA 2020 ] The USM modi fications and new procedures are summarized in Section 1.1 and a detailed summary of protocol changes is provided in Section 2.1. This proto col amendment also incorporates removal of the secondary endpoint all -cause hospitalization and death events over 18 months in patients with cardiac involvement. This change is summarized in Section 1.2 and a detailed summary of protocol changes is provided in Section 2.2. These changes will not be implemented until appropriate Health Authority and Ethics Committee (EC) and/or Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. 1.1. Urgent Safet y Measures due to the Impact of the COVID -19 Pandemic Urgent Safety Measures were implemented by the Sponsor, as mentioned above, to ensure the safety of study participants and the integrity of study data in response to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic. The changes are outlined below, and a detailed summary of the USMs is provided in Section 2.1.  Expanded ALN -TTRSC02 Dosing Outside the Study Center Administration of ALN -TTRSC02 will be permitted outside the study center by a home healthcare professional (eg, the patient’s home) at all time points provided the patient has tolerated at least 1 dose of ALN -TTRSC02 administered in the study center (previously allowed after Month 18).  Expanded use of Pre -filled Syringes for ALN -TTRSC02 Administration ALN -TTRSC02 may be administered via pre -filled syringes at any time point during the study as this presentation becomes available (previously allowed after Week 36).  ALN -TTRSC02 Dosing Outside the Study Center by Patient or Caregiver Following appropriate training on ALN -TTRSC02, dosing will be permitted by the patient or caregiver at all timepoints under the oversight of the Investigator and following consultation with the Medical Monitor. This measure is intended to remain"
212,page_212,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN-TTRSC02 (vutrisiran) Amendment 2, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 2 in effect only during periods of time when the COVID -19 pandemic impe des the ability of patients to travel to the study site or healthcare professionals to go to patients' homes for dosing. In addition, added references to patient/caregiver instructions for administration, storage of study drug, and reporting of product complaints.  Expanded Window After Which a ALN -TTRSC02 Dose Will be Considered Delayed If a patient does not receive a dose of ALN -TTRSC02 within the specified dosing window, the dose may be administered with up to an 8 -week delay (previously 6 weeks) to be considered a delayed dose . In cases in which a dose is delayed in this manner for issues related to the COVID -19 pandemic, the Medical Monitor should be informed as soon as possible, but prior consultation is not required. In all cases, the dose should be administered as close as possible to the scheduled time point. Given the long activity of the drug resulting in sustained suppression of TTR as observed in Phase 1 study, an occasional delay of 8 weeks in dosing is expected to have minimal impact on the T TR suppression (decrease of only 7% in TTR suppression relative to vutrisiran original scheduled dosing) as predicted by the Sponsor’s PK/PD modeling. Resumption of dosing as per original dosing schedule is expected to be tolerated based on the safety from Phase 1 study which evaluated doses as high as 300 mg (12× higher than the therapeutic dose of 25 mg administered quarterly). Accordingly, this change has been implemented to provide greater flexibility amid travel and other restrictions related to the C OVID -19 pandemic, in order to minimize the number of missed doses on study.  Expanded Patisiran Dosing Outside the Study Center Administration of patisiran will be permitted outside the study center by a home healthcare professional (eg, the patient’s home) at all timepoint s (previously allowed after Month 9) , provided the patient has tolerated at least 2 doses of patisiran administered in the study center . These changes were implemented to reduce the frequency of patie nt visits to the study center, and therefore reduce potential exposure to COVID -19, while maintaining continuity of study drug dosing. Based on the overall safety profile of patisiran, the frequency of infusion -related reactions (IRRs) decreases over time and IRRs do not increase in severity. When IRRs have occurred, most have been mild or moderate in severity, have not required any treatment and have not resulted in interruption during the infusion or a change in administration. When infusions have been in terrupted due to an IRR, these have primarily been reported in patients during the first 2 infusions. Thus, for patients who tolerate infusions, these data support home administration following 2 doses administered at the study center. Home dosing of stu dy drug will be performed by a healthcare professional, with oversight of the Investigator, allowing for ongoing appropriate monitoring of the patient."
213,page_213,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN-TTRSC02 (vutrisiran) Amendment 2, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 3  Premedication Equivalents may be Administered Orally Clarified that oral premedication equivalents are p ermitted, but must be administered in the presence of a healthcare professional. There have been no increases in IRR frequency with oral steroids compared to IV steroids for pre -medication.  Corticosteroid Tapering Outside the Study Center Corticosteroid t apering may be performed in the clinic or, at the discretion of the Investigator , may be performed outside of the clinic (eg, in the patient ’s home) after consultation with the Medical Monitor . This change was implemented to allow for reduction of steroid s, where it is deemed in the best interest of the patient by the investigator, in the context of expanded home dosing necessitated by the COVID -19 pandemic as outlined above. Patisiran dosing, and thus steroid tapering, will be performed by a healthcare professional, with oversight of the investigator, allowing for appropriate monitoring of the patient. Support for this approach comes from a review of data from the patisiran treated patients who have tapered steroids in the global -label extension studies (ALN - TTR02 -003, ALN -TTR02 -004 and ALN -TTR02 -006) where IRRs were infrequent, mild, and tapering of steroids was not associated with an increase in the rate of IRRs.  Expanded the Patisiran Administration Window Expanded the patisiran administration window . If a patient does not receive a dose of patisiran within the dosing window (±3 days) due to COVID -19, the dose may be administered with up to 7 days delay after the scheduled visit, after consultation with the Medical Monitor (to be considered a delayed d ose). Previously the dose was to be considered missed if received outside the dosing window (±3 days). Based on Phase 1 data with patisiran (ALN -TTR02 -001), an occasional 7 -day delay in dosing for patisiran is expected to have a minimal impact on TTR supp ression (ie, a decrease of ~10% in TTR suppression relative to patisiran original scheduled dosing). Resumption of dosing as per the original dosing schedule is expected to be tolerated based on the safety results from earlier patisiran studies. According ly, this change has been implemented to provide greater flexibility amid travel and other restrictions related to the COVID -19 pandemic, in order to minimize the number of missed doses on study.  Assessments Performed Outside the Study Center Routine ass essments may be performed outside of the study center (eg, the patient’s home) by a trained healthcare professional at all timepoints. These assessments include the following: vital signs, physical exam, weight, ECGs, pregnancy tests, urine collection, bl ood draws (clinical laboratory assessments, ADA, PK; ATTR/vitamin A; exploratory samples), collection of information regarding vital status, hospitalizations, urgent care visits, procedures, and concomitant medications. Wherever possible, AE collection ass ociated with visits outside of the clinic will be collected by qualified site staff through verbal contact with the patient."
214,page_214,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN-TTRSC02 (vutrisiran) Amendment 2, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 4 All laboratory samples should be sent to the central laboratory however, an exception has been added that local laboratory assessme nts are permitted in cases when assessment at central laboratory is not possible due to complications related to the COVID -19 pandemic. Added that with the exception of patients unable to come to the site due to the COVID -19 pandemic limiting the patient’s ability or willingness to access the study center, at a minimum, patients must visit the site for scheduled dosing and assessments at the Week 12 and Week 60 visits within the study visit windows and for efficacy assessments as detailed below. If any study assessments are not able to be completed at the site or at home within the study visit window, the study physician (or delegate) must verbally contact the patient to collect relevant safety information (including, but not limited to, AEs, concomitant medications, hospitalizations/procedures, and vital status).  Liver Function Tests (LFTs) The timing of LFT assessments was updated to coincide with ALN -TTRSC02 dosing visits (which are every 12 weeks). Thus, starting at Week 12, patients on ALN - TTRSC02 will have LFT results done every 12 weeks, instead of the current schedule of assessments, where LFT were assessed every 6 weeks until Month 9 and then every 12 weeks after Month 9. Additionally, the requirement for additional LFT results within 28 days p rior to each ALN -TTRSC02 dose has been removed. Dosing decisions may will be based on the LFTs collected at the previous dosing visit (up to 14 weeks prior to dosing) . These changes were implemented in order to limit the number of times a patient needs to visit the site/interact with home healthcare professionals and reduce potential exposure to COVID -19. The changes are based on the available safety data from the prior Phase 1 study (ALN -TTRSC02 -001) and from this study (HELIOS -A), which have shown that ALN -TTRSCO2 continues to have an acceptable safety profile. In HELIOS -A, as of 08 April 2020, 120 patients had received a total of 305 doses of vutrisiran 25 mg every 3 months (mean 2.5 doses, range: 1 -5 doses). This provides a mean exposure of 130.4 d ays (range: 1 to 339 days) and most patients (101 out of 120) have had at least 2 doses of vutrisiran. No subjects in the ongoing HELIOS -A study have had laboratory elevations of >3xULN for ALT or AST and no subjects have required interruption of study dr ug due to elevations in liver transaminases, bilirubin or adverse hepatic events. Thus, with increasing exposure in HELIOS -A, vutrisiran continues to have an acceptable hepatic safety profile. The Sponsor acknowledges that liver transaminase elevations r emain an important potential risk based on the mechanism of action of vutrisiran, as well as findings in pre-clinical studies and early -phase clinical trials. The specific rules for monitoring and dosing in the setting of transaminase elevations outlined in the protocol are unchanged (Section 5.2.3 Table 6 [Monitoring and Dosing Rules for Asymptomatic Patients with Confirmed Isolated Elevations of ALT and/or AST >3× ULN, with No Alternative Cause Identified ])."
215,page_215,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN-TTRSC02 (vutrisiran) Amendment 2, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 5 Given the available safety data for vutrisiran, the degree of risk of COVID -19 exposure related to the additional visits is considered in excess of the degree of risk mitigation obtained by more frequent LFT monitoring. With the current changes, a robust LFT monitoring schedule of every 12 weeks, is maintained and the results will be regularly reviewed by the Medical Monitor and the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). Continuous monitoring of adverse events will also allow for detection of any clinically relevant events and additional LFTs may be obtained at any time at the discretion of the investigator.  Efficacy Assessments at Month 9 Clarified that all efficacy visits must be conducted at the clinic (Month 9, Month 18, Month 27, Month 36, a nd modified efficacy visits). Specified that for situations in which a Month 9 efficacy visit is unable to be completed due to the COVID -19 pandemic limiting the patient’s ability or willingness to access the study center or their ability to have received their scheduled doses of study drug, the Medical Monitor should be consulted as soon as possible to determine the appropriate timing of the Month 9 efficacy assessment. After consultation with the Medical Monitor , Month 9 efficacy assessments may be completed within 6 months after the intended time point ( ie, up to Study Month 15). This change was implemented to allow for collection of critical efficacy data while limiting unnecessary patient exposure to COVID 19 and to ensure, to the extent possible, that study integrity is maintained amid travel and other restrictions related to the COVID -19 pandemic. It is anticipated that the estimated treatment effects at Months 9 and 18 on vutrisiran treatment will be similar to the treatment effects observed on patisiran treatment in Study ALN -TTR02 -004 (APOLLO). For these endpoints in the APOLLO study, treatment differences between patisiran and placebo -treated patients increased from Month 9 to Month 18. These increasing treatment differences were attributable largely to continued progression between Months 9 and 18 among placebo -treated patients. Based on these data, the delayed Month 9 efficacy assessments up to Month 15 would be similar to unobserved Month 9 efficacy assessments that would have been missed without this delayed assessment allowance, if not slightly worse considering potentially missed doses. Therefore, it is expected that this missing data minimization strategy will yield similar if not conservative estimated treatment effects on vutrisiran compared to what may have been observed had the COVID -19 pan demic not occurred during the course of this study.  Transthyretin (TTR)/Vitamin A Assessments After Week 12, TTR/Vitamin A sample collections between ALN -TTRSC02 dosing visits have been removed for all patients. This change has been made as part of the ov erall strategy of reducing visits and assessments during the COVID -19 pandemic. Removal of these assessments is not expected to have a meaningful impact on the TTR efficacy endpoint at Month 18 as our modeling data support that there are minimal fluctuati ons in TTR levels over the dosing interval following Week 12; ie, following 2nd dose of ALN -TTRSC02."
216,page_216,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN-TTRSC02 (vutrisiran) Amendment 2, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 6  Timing of other assessments Reduced the frequency of select assessments or combined assessments from different visits to align with do sing visits in order to limit the number of times a patient needs to visit the site/interact with home healthcare professionals and reduce potential exposure to COVID -19.  Secondary Endpoint of TTR percent reduction Changed the secondary endpoint related to comparison of TTR pe rcent reduction in the ALN -TTRSC02 arm compared to patisiran through 9 months to 18 months. This change is being implemented to address concerns with regard to missed doses related to COVID -19 during critical time periods preceding the Month 9 assessment with potential impact to the integrity of this endpoint. TTR percent reduction through Month 9 was planned to be evaluated for noninferiority compared to the within -study randomized patisiran arm. This endpoint was specified in the SAP to be evaluated on the Per -protocol (PP) Population. With dosing flexibility adopted due to the COVID - 19 pandemic, it is expected that the number of patients qualifying for the PP Population will be substantially reduced, thus greatly reducing power for the originally planne d Month 9 analysis of TTR percent reduction. Changing TTR percent reduction from Month 9 to Month 18 is anticipated to allow for a more viable noninferiority comparison with sufficient power.  Collection of Information Related to COVID -19 Information relat ed to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on patient participation in the study will be collected for each patient in order to enable analysis of the impact of the COVID -19 global pandemic on clinical trial data.  Updates to Study Administration Text Text was updated to provide clarification of Investigator responsibilities regarding communication of new study information to patients and IRB/IECs. 1.2. Changes Not Related to Urgent Safety Measures Several additional changes are being implemented, which are outlined below and a detailed summary is provided in Section 2.2.  Secondary Endpoint of all -cause hospitalization and death events over 18 months in Pa tients with Cardiac Involvement The secondary endpoint all -cause hospitalization and death events over 18 months in patients with cardiac involvement was removed. This change was implemented based on review of baseline data which suggests that a minority of patients are likely to meet pre -specified criteria for the cardiac subpopulation thus limiting the value of this analysis. Initial projections of sample size was based upon the ALN -TTR02 -004 Study (APOLLO), which enrolled 90/148 (60.8%) patisiran -treated patients into the Cardiac Subpopulation. In the current study, only 36/122 (29%) vutrisiran -treated patients"
217,page_217,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN-TTRSC02 (vutrisiran) Amendment 2, 06 May 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 7 qualified for the Cardiac Subpopulation, which is anticipated to result in an under - powered endpoint. The following changes are not detailed: administrative changes, corrections to typographical errors, punctuation, grammar, abbreviations, and formatting."

The corresponding text has been revised throughout the protocol. Deleted text is indicated by strikeout ; added text is indicated by bold font. 2.1. Urgent Safety Measure COVID -19-related Changes to be Adopted Immediately Purpose: The following changes were made related to administration of ALN-TTRSC02 :  Expanded ALN -TTRSC02 Dosing Outside the Study Center  Expanded use of Pre -filled Syringes for ALN -TTRSC02 Administration  ALN-TTRSC02 Dosing Outside the Study Cen ter by Patient or Caregiver  Expanded Window After Which a Dose Will be Considered Delayed  Modified other dose, administration, and product complaint sections to match new administration strategy The primary changes occur in Section 5.2.2.1 (ALN -TTRSC02 ) and Section 5.2.1 (Description ) 5.2.2.1. ALN -TTRSC02 Revised text: ALN -TTRSC02 25 mg SC injection will be administered q3M (12 weeks ±3 days during the Treatment Period and ±7 days during the Treatment Extension Period). Study drug SC injections in the c linic will be administered under the supervision of the Investigator or a trained healthcare professional. ALN -TTRSC02 may be administered at a location other than the study center (eg, the patient’s home) as specified below. All ALN -TTRSC02 doses will be administered at the clinic during scheduled study assessment visits during the Treatment Period on Day 1 through Month 18. During the Treatment Extension Period, starting at Week 84/Month 19, patients who are tolerating their ALN -TTRSC02 injections as de termined by the Investigator and where applicable country and local regulations allow, may have ALN -TTRSC02 administered outside the clinic (eg, home) by a healthcare professional trained on study drug administration. If a patient has tolerated at least 1 dose of ALN -TTRSC02 in the clinic, subsequent dosing may be administered outside the study site (eg, the patient’s home) at all time points where allowed by applicable country and local regulations. In these ca ses, dosing should be administered by a trai ned healthcare professional, with oversight by the Investigator. If the patient is unable to come to the study center, and a visit by a home healthcare professional is not possible due to circumstances related to th e COVID -19 pandemic, ALN -TTRSC02 may be a dministered by the patient or the caregiver under the oversight of the"

I n such cases, the patient or caregiver must receive appropri ate training on ALN -TTRSC02 administration. This measure is intended to remain in effect only during periods of time when the COVID -19 pandemic impedes the ability of patients to travel to the study site or healthcare professionals to go to patients' home s for dosing. Additional details, including detailed instructions for study drug administration, can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. In addition, instructions and procedures related to administration of ALN -TTRSC02 by a patient or caregiver will be provid ed in the ALN -TTRSC02 Patient/Caregiver Storage and Administration Instructions. Method of Administration of ALN -TTRSC02 ALN -TTRSC02 is for SC use and should be administered by a healthcare professional . The SC injection site may be marked and mapped for later observation. The preferred site of injection is the abdomen. Optional additional sites are the upper arms and thighs. If a local reaction around the injection site occurs, photographs may be obtained. Additional details, including detailed instructions for study drug administration, can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. Detailed Instructions for Use for the pre -filled syringe will also be provided. Missed Doses of ALN -TTRSC02 If a patient does not receive a dose of ALN -TTRSC02 within the spe cified dosing window, the Investigator should contact the Medical Monitor. After such consultation, the dose may be administered with up to a 6an 8-week delay (to be considered a delayed dose). Thereafter, the dose will be considered missed and not admin istered. If a dose is administered with a delay, the next dose will resume following the original schedule. In cases in which a dose is delayed in this manner for issues related to the COVID -19 pandemic, the Medical Monitor should be informed as soon as p ossible, but prior consultation is not required. In all cases, the dose should be administered as close as possible to the scheduled timepoint. During the Treatment Period, every effort should be made to avoid missed doses of ALN -TTRSC02. During the Trea tment Period, if a patient misses a dose for reasons unrelated to the COVID -19 pandemic , the Investigator, in consultation with the Medical Monitor, will discuss whether the patient will be able to continue in the study (see also Section 4.3). 5.2.1.

In these cases, dosing should be administered by a trained healthcare professional, with oversight by the Investigator. Required premedication for patients in the patisiran arm All patients should receive premedication prior to patisiran administration to reduce the risk of infusion -related reactions (IRRs). Each of the following medicinal products should be given on the day of patisiran infusion at least 60 minutes prior to the start o f infusion:  Intravenous corticosteroid (dexamethasone 10 mg, or equivalent)  Oral paracetamol (500 mg)  Intravenous H1 blocker (diphenhydramine 50 mg, or equivalent)  Intravenous H2 blocker (ranitidine 50 mg, or equivalent) For premedications not available or not tolerated intravenously, equivalents may be admi nistered orally. Oral premedication equivalents are permitted, but must be administered in the presence of a healthcare professional. Modifications to lower the corticosteroid dose may be made to the premedication regimen for either of the following 2 reasons: 1. If a patient is having difficulty tolerating the corticosteroid premedication regimen (eg, patient develops uncontrolled hyperglycemia, altered mental status, or other complication), then lowering of the corticosteroid premedication may be allowe d for that patient after consultation with the medical monitor. 2. If a patient has tolerated 3 or more infusions of patisiran with their current corticosteroid premedication regimen (ie, pati ent has not had IRRs during the past 3 or more infusions), then lowering of the corticosteroid premedication is recommended. Corticosteroid tapering should be performed in the clinic. Steps to lower corticosteroid dosing are provided in the Study Manual Pharmacy Manual . Corticosteroid tapering may be performed in the clinic or , at the discretion of the investigator, may be performed outside of the clinic (eg, in the patients home) after consultation with the Medical Monitor. Additional or higher doses of one or more of the premedications may be administered to reduce the risk o f IRRs, if needed. Guidelines for management of IRRs can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. Method of Administration of patisiran Patisiran is for IV use and should be administered by a healthcare professional. Weight from previous visit may be used for calculating dose. Weight must be collected predose. The patient’s infusion site should be assessed for signs of any localized reaction during the infusion and for 30 minutes after the end of the infusion. The patie nt will"

Detailed instructions for study drug preparation and administration can be found in the Pharmacy Manual. Missed Doses of patisiran If a patient does not receive a dose of patisiran within the dosing window (±3 days) due to COVID -19 the dose will be considered missed and not administered the dose may be administered with up to 7 days delay after the scheduled visit, after consultation with the Medical Monit or (to be considered a delayed dose). If a dose is administered with a delay, the next dose will resume following the original schedule per the Schedule of Assessments.

RATIONALE FOR PROTOC OL AMENDMENT The COVID -19 pandemic has led to a shift in healthcare from the clinic to home settings world - wide and has required adjustments to ensure patient saf ety and study integrity which were implemented in a previous protocol amendment (Amendment 2 dated 06 May 2020 ). To date, the risk mitigation steps introduced with this prior amendment have allowed dosing to continue as scheduled for the majority of ALN -TTRSC02 patients, while maintaining appropriate safety monitoring and minimizing missed efficacy assessments. However, the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic present s risks in some regions for disruption of treatment, potentially impacting key efficacy assessments , until a vaccine or effective treatment is widely available. This amendment includes revisions to the study endpoints for the primary purpose of mitigating any potential impact from the pandemic on key efficacy assessments. This amendment also includes ana lysis of efficacy endpoints at Month 18 as secondary endpoints in the statistical hierarchy to allow more complete characterization of the treatment effect of ALN -TTRSC02. Collectively, these changes will ensure the adequate evaluation of the effects of AL N-TTRSCO2 on neurological impairment, quality of life, gait speed, nutritional status and disability , while minimizing potential confounding effects of the COVID -19 pandemic . As the primary analysis will be conducted at Month 9, it should be noted that a s of the time of this amendment, the majority (approximately 67%) of patients have not yet completed the Month 9 efficacy visit. The Sponsor has remained blinded to efficacy data in accordance with the data integrity plan and thus has made the changes without any knowledge of these data. Therefore, the changes to the co -primary endpoint and select secondary endpoints are not considered to impa ct study integrity. The changes to the endpoints are outlined below and a detailed summary of changes is provided in Section 2. Changes to the Primar y Analysis at Month 9 to Mitigate Risks related to the Pandemic Quality of life (Norfolk Quality of Life -Diabetic Neuropathy [Norfolk QoL -DN]), nutritional status (modified body mass index [mBMI]), and disability (Rasch -built Overall Disability Scale [R-ODS]) are efficacy measures that are important for establishing the benefit of ALN - TTRSC02 in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. The pandemic has the potential to affect components of these assessments in multiple ways, including changes in anxiety and stress from the pandemic, the potential for loss of employment, and disruptions in physical activity and social interactions due to social distancing and the closure of public gathering places related to the pandemic."
234,page_234,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 (vutrisiran) Amendment 3 Summary of Changes, 17 July 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 2 While it is dif ficult to predict the precise impact of the pandemic, changes to endpoints at Month 9 have been introduced to mitigate the potential risk of these external factors confounding interpretation of the true treatment effect of ALN -TTRSC02:  The co -primary endpo int of change from baseline in Norfolk QoL -DN total score at Month 9 has been changed to the first key secondary endpoint in the hierarchical testing order. Modified NIS+7 will now be the sole primary endpoint at Month 9. While Norfolk QoL -DN involves neur opathy -specific measures, it also includes questions about general physical and emotional health, both of which may be impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic in a manner that is difficult to precisely estimate. The change to key secondary endpoint has been made to mitigate the risk of any potential confounding impact of the pandemic. Establishing the efficacy of ALN - TTRSC02 on the patient’s perception of neuropathy impairment with the Norfolk - QoL remains a critical objective of the study; having this measure as a key secondary endpoint will support the clinical relevance of observed changes in the primary endpoint of modified NIS+7. Modified NIS+7 is a well -established and reproducible measure of neuropathy progression that may be less susceptible to external fa ctors associated with the pandemic and thus will remain as the primary endpoint at Month 9.  The secondary endpoints of mBMI and R -ODS at Month 9 have been changed from secondary to exploratory endpoints. R-ODS captures activity and social participation lim itations and provides an overall picture of disability. Modified BMI provides an assessment of nutritional status. Both of these assessments may also be impacted by pandemic related stressors, missed doses and/or impact on lifestyle. Accordingly, these two endpoints have been changed from secondary to exploratory endpoints at Month 9. With this amendment, these endpoints will be formally tested at Month 18, when we expect they will be less subject to impact from the pandemic, as described below. Expanded A nalysis at Month 18 to Further Characterize Treatment Effect Over Time  The following efficacy endpoints have been added to the testing hierarchy at Month 18 for change from baseline parameters compared to the placebo arm of Study ALN -TTR02 -004 (APOLLO; pat isiran): mNIS+7, Norfolk QoL -DN total score, timed 10 -meter walk test (10 -MWT), mBMI, and R -ODS. The addition of these endpoints at Month 18 is consistent with the timepoint used for analysis of the primary endpoint in the APOLLO study. The expanded analy sis at Month 18 will allow for more complete characterization of the treatment effect of ALN -TTRSC02 over time and the potential for sustained improvements in neurologic impairment, quality of life, gait speed, disability and nutrition. Additional Changes to Endpoints  Removed change at Month 18 compared to baseline in mNIS+7 and Norfolk QoL-DN total score in ALN -TTRSC02 -treated patients. The additional endpoint analyses added at Month 18 have replaced the need for this analysis."
235,page_235,"Clinical Study Protocol ALN -TTRSC02 -002 ALN -TTRSC02 (vutrisiran) Amendment 3 Summary of Changes, 17 July 2020 Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Confidential 3  Removed the secondary endpoint of composite events of all -cause deaths and/or all - cause hospitalizations in the overall population (over 18 months) compared to the placebo arm of the APOLLO study ; removed adjudication of the reasons for hospitalizations.

Additional Changes and Clarifications  Added a clarification that for submission of the marketing authorization to the European Union, formal hypothesis testing will be conducted at Month 18, with mNIS+7 compared to the placebo arm of the APOLLO study at Month 18 considered the primary endpoint. Details will be specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP).  Added a definition of the Per -Protocol Population.  Similar to the clarification at Month 9 for efficacy assessments in t he previous amendment ( Amendment 2 dated 06 May 2020 ), a specification was added that when a Month 18 efficacy visit is unable to be completed due to the COVID -19 pandemic limiting the patient’s ability or willingness to access the study center or their ab ility to have received their scheduled doses of study drug, the Medical Monitor should be consulted as soon as possible to determine the appropriate timing of the Month 18 efficacy assessment. After consultation with the Medical Monitor, Month 18 efficacy assessments may be completed within 6 months after the intended time point (ie, up to Study Month 24).  Added clarification that if a dose is delayed (up to 8 -weeks for ALN -TTRSC02 or 7 days for patisiran), study assessments associated with the originally scheduled dose may also be delayed to coincide with the delayed dose.  Added clarification that the delay of Month 18 efficacy assessments will not affect the timepoint for patients on patisiran to switch to ALN -TTRSC02 at Week 84.  Removed the requirement that assessors who perform efficacy assessments at Central Assessment Sites will be different from site personnel who monitor administration of study drug and the well -being of the patient during the study. This change was made as involvement of site pers onnel in patient management is not expected to impact efficacy assessment evaluations and the requirement placed an undue burden on sites , especially amid COVID -19 restrictions at the sites.  Added a clarification that postural blood pressure will be measur ed as described in the Study Manual. The following changes are not detailed: administrative changes and corrections to typographical errors, punctuation, grammar, abbreviations, and formatting."

Purpose: Addition of a Randomized Treatment Extension (RTE) Period The primary change occurs in Section : Section 3.1, Summary of Study Design Revised text: This is a global Phase 3 randomized, open -label study designed to evaluate efficacy, safety, and PK/PD of ALN -TTRSC02 in adult patients with hATTR amyloidosis. Patients will be randomized 3:1 to ALN -TTRSC02 or patisiran, a reference comparator. Randomization will be stratified by TTR genotype (V30M vs. non -V30M) and baseline NIS score (<50 vs ≥50). The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 42 days, an 18 -month Treatment Period, and an 18 -month RTE Period in lieu of the Legacy Treatment Extension Period . A Follow -up Period of up to 1 year will occur after the last dose of study drug (Figure 2) . 18-Month Treatment Period After the Screening period at the start of the Treatment Period, eligible patients will be randomized 3:1 on Day 1 to receive 25 mg of ALN -TTRSC02 administered as a SC injection q3M or patisiran administered as an IV infusion q3w; patients in the patisiran arm wil l also receive premedications prior to each dose (see Section 5.2.2.2). During the 18 -month Treatment Period, patients will un dergo assessments for efficacy and/or safety (as outlined in the Schedule of Assessments), with key efficacy assessments being perf ormed prior to first dose, at Month 9 (primary efficacy analysis timepoint) and at Month 18; samples for TTR assessment will be collected more frequently throughout the 18 -month Treatment Period. All efficacy visits must be conducted at the clinic (Month 9, Month 18, Month 27, Month 36, and modified efficacy visits). In situations in which a Month 9 or Month 18 efficacy visit i s unable to be completed due to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic limiting the patient’s ability or willingness to access the study center or their ability to have received their sch eduled doses of study drug, the Medical Monitor should be c onsulted as soon as possible to determine the appropriate timing of the Month 9 or Month 18 efficacy assessments as applicable. After consultation with the Medical Monitor, the Month 9 or Month 18 efficacy assessments may be completed within 6 months after the intended time point (ie, up to Month 15 or Month 24, respectively). Dosing may be allowed outside of the study center (eg, the patient’s home) under certain circumstances as specified in Sectio n 5.2.2.1 and Section 5.2.2.2 . In addition, routine asse ssments and collection of relevant safety information may be collected outside the study center as specified at the beginning of Section 6."
