0,page_0,"1 The incidence of psychological comorbidities in paediatric and young adults with inflammatory bowel disease, and the impacts of mental health conditions on quality of life, disease severity and resource utilisation: a population-based cohort study in the UK Protocol NCT number: [Not available at submission] Study ID: P043 Document Date: 24th January, 2022 Project highlights  This study will provide the first UK-based population level analysis of the risk of psychological comorbidities in children, adolescents, and young adults with IBD. The data resulting from this project will provide a measure of the magnitude of any associations. These insights will be valuable for clinicians managing people IBD in this age range; allowing early interventions to be targeted to those most at risk, and potentially reducing the likelihood of more serious future mental health problems.  The dataset available for use in this project is one of the highest quality primary care data sources available world-wide. It provides the complete coded primary care record with robust data on comorbidities and treatments. In the paediatric population complete records since birth are available for the majority of people."
1,page_1,"2  Our in-house matching algorithm ensures a higher quality of case-control matching than is available using any other existing statistical software or tools. This is vital to produce reliable data and satisfy external peer review. Matching within a population-based sample has additional advantages over the use of secondary care cohorts, US claim-based datasets, or disease registry datasets. These advantages include minimisation of bias in the control group and the opportunity to select a comparator group affected by another chronic condition. Background Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises 3 main subtypes; ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease (CD) and IBD unclassified (IBDU). IBD develops at any age; with around 10% diagnosed in childhood.(1) Whilst UC is the most common subtype of IBD in adults, CD is more common in the paediatric IBD (PIBD) population. International trends have confirmed a global rise in the incidence of PIBD; in particular, a steep rise in the incidence of CD.(2) In Scotland, data shows a dramatic increase in PIBD, especially in incidence of CD which has risen 500% over just 40 years.(3) PIBD is associated with more extensive disease compared to adult onset IBD, with additional considerations which include growth failure, delayed puberty, poor bone density and psychosocial impact during a vulnerable period of life.(1, 4) The goals of treating IBD are to induce and maintain remission and to avoid disease complications, drug-related complications and unnecessary surgery, psychological health, promoting a return to, and maintenance of, a normal lifestyle that includes education, family, social function and physical activity.(1, 5) Other essential goals in children include optimizing growth, puberty, and psychological health and promoting a return to, and maintenance of, a normal lifestyle that includes education, family, social function, and physical activity.(1)"
2,page_2,"3 Psychological comorbidities associated with PIBD include anxiety; which may be related to the perceived or actual side effects of IBD therapies, altered body image and a feeling of lack of control over their lives, and depression; associated with severe/active disease, current steroid use and the need for an ostomy.(6) Conflicting results and methodological constraints have limited previous understanding of psychosocial functioning in PIBD.(7) Reported rates of clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety have ranged from 25% to 73% in children and adolescents with PIBD.(6) However, recent studies highlight growing concerns for psychiatric morbidity in IBD in children and young adults. A US study(8) of 58,020 IBD patients aged 5-24 reported a prevalence of psychiatric disorders of 21.6%; mainly comprising depression and anxiety disorders. IBD was found to be 5 times more likely associated with psychiatric disorders than with controls, and the incidence of these disorders was associated with a steady increase in trend over time (2% in 2006 compared to 15% in 2017).(8) Similarly, Swedish data(9) from 6464 PIBD patients, indicate an association of IBD with psychiatric morbidity of 17.3%. Most concerningly, this study reported IBD to be significantly associated with suicide attempt and as well as mood disorders, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, personality disorders, attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorders. Results for each sex were similar. A correlation of age and development of psychiatric disorders was indicated for patients with very early-onset IBD (<6 years). Furthering our understanding of the psychosocial sequalae of IBD in children and young adults is particularly important in light of evidence suggesting that symptoms of anxiety and depression may decrease adherence to treatment, thus impacting on longer term disease outcomes,(6) and has been emphasized in a recent call to action issued within gastroenterology to improve understanding and early identification of comorbidities associated with IBD.(10) To the best of our knowledge, there have not been any large population-based studies assessing the association between psychosocial comorbidities in IBD in"
3,page_3,"4 children and young adults and disease related outcomes. The aim of this study is therefore to fill this data gap, and to examine the following objectives. Such new insights will be valuable for clinicians in optimising patient care for IBD patients; allowing early interventions to be targeted to those most at risk, and potentially preventing the development of more serious mental health problems such as depression; linked to difficulties with medication adherence, and anxiety; which may exacerbate future disease activity.(7, 10) Ultimately, we anticipate that these data will be useful in understanding the potential cycle and interrelationship between IBD and mental health in children and young adults. Objectives: Stream 1 – Incidence of mental health conditions Primary Objectives  Compare the risk and cumulative incidence of mental health conditions in children and young adults with IBD compared to matched population controls in the primary care setting, stratified by IBD type Secondary Objectives  Determine severity of mental health conditions in those with and without IBD (e.g. evidence of self-harm, suicide attempt, behavioural disorders) Objectives: Stream 2 – Impacts of mental health conditions Primary Objective:  Determine the association of mental health conditions in children and young adults with IBD on quality-of-life indicators Secondary Objectives:  Compare IBD severity/disease markers in children and young adults with IBD with and without mental health illness"

5,page_5,"6 Methods The study protocol was specified a priori and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (Study identifier: TBC#). Data source The Optimum Patient Care Research Database (OPCRD). This database incorporates pseudonymised primary care records from 700 GP practices distributed across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The current OPCRD cohort size is over 5 million actively registered people, and historic records available for 10.1 million people. The cohort dataset can be enhanced through direct-to-patient and direct-to-care provider questionnaires at additional cost if required. Study design The proposed study will use the retrospectively collected data of all eligible patients within the database at the date of data extraction. Within this primary care cohort, all patients with IBD comprising of the three main subtypes; ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease (CD) and IBD unclassified (IBDU), excluding microscopic colitis, radiation induced enterocolitis and drug-induced enterocolitis, will be identified using diagnostic codes and prescription records. A diagnostic algorithm will be developed to facilitate robust case identification of IBD and IBD subtypes, as well as mental health outcomes. Statistical methods We will use standard descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviations, etc) to describe the characteristics of the study cohort."
6,page_6,"7 Recorded sociodemographic characteristics and clinical features Sociodemographic data will comprise by age group, age at diagnosis, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Ethnicity will be categorised as follows to be consistent with the UK official census categories: White, Asian, Black African/Caribbean, Mixed, and Other. The index of multiple deprivation (IMD) will be used as a measure of socioeconomic status. This is derived from patient postcode at the point of data extraction. Stream 1: Study Cohort Stream 1: Definition of people with new onset IBD The eligible PIBD cases will comprise all incident cases of PIBD over the last decade, we will not follow patients up beyond 01/01/2020 due to changes in patient health behaviour and primary care interactions due to COVID-19. We will extract sociodemographic details for all these cases and matched controls (described below). Sociodemographic data will comprise by age group, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Ethnicity will be categorised as follows to be consistent with the UK official census categories: White, Asian, Black African/Caribbean, Mixed, and Other. The index of multiple deprivation (IMD) will be used as a measure of socioeconomic status. This is derived from patient postcode at the point of data extraction. Stream 1: Definition of matched controls without IBD We will match each incident case of PIBD with controls (children without IBD) using propensity score matching (matching on the sociodemographic variables list above and matching within primary care practice if numbers allow). People with a known diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) will be excluded from the potential pool of controls. We will compare the incidence of new onset mental health conditions in PIBD and controls using a similar approach to that used by Butwick et al. (2019) in their paper exploring psychiatric disorders in a"
7,page_7,"8 PIBD cohort in Sweden.(9) The mental health conditions to be examined are listed in table 1 although there is scope to add to or modify these in discussion with the study authors. For a composite ‘any psychological condition’ outcome (see Table 1), risk will be stratified by age of PIBD onset and sex. We will then go beyond the analysis of the Swedish study to estimate the cumulative risk of the ‘any psychological condition’ composite outcome in PIBD patients compared with controls. This will provide a unique, robust, estimate of the overall mental health burden (prevalence) in PIBD. Condition Description Primary outcomes Any psychological condition A composite of all the chronic psychiatric conditions listed below* (depression, anxiety, eating disorders, body image disorder, attention-deficit disorder, behavioural disorders, adjustment disorder, acute stress disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder) Depression Major recurrent depression or treated depressive episode Anxiety Non-phobia related anxiety episodes or disorder Secondary outcomes Self-harm Any coded episode of deliberate self-harm of any type Suicide attempt Any episode of suicide attempt and suicide related codes, including deliberate medication overdose Other chronic psychiatric conditions Eating disorders, body image disorder, attention-deficit disorder (ADHD), behavioural disorders, adjustment disorder, acute stress disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Others Problems with sleep *this excludes conditions which are potentially single events i.e. self-harm or suicide attempt. (See Appendix 1 – Table s3 for Read Codes and SNOMED Codes"
8,page_8,"9 for mental health conditions, Table s4 for mental health condition algorithms and Table s5 for WHO ICD-10 mental health conditions). Stream 1: Incidence of mental health conditions The study will report the incidence of each mental health condition overall in the PIBD cases and controls, and adjusted hazard ratios to test the association between PIBD and risk of the same mental health conditions. Within the PIBD cohort we will examine the relationship between PIBD age of onset, sex, ethnicity, and social deprivation and the ‘any psychological condition’ composite outcome. Cox proportional hazards models will be used to compare disease incidence in PIBD cases and controls and also when comparing the associations of baseline features and outcomes within the PIBD cohort. The study start date will be the date of diagnosis of PIBD or, for controls, the date of diagnosis of their matched counterpart. The end of follow-up will be the first of; the point of data extraction (exact date TBC), the patient’s 25th birthday, date of loss to follow-up (either GP practice deregistration or death). All individuals contributing at least six months of follow-up time in the analysis will be included. Those with existing evidence of the mental health condition prior to baseline will be excluded for analysis of that particular outcome where it would not reoccur, for example if individual has already received a diagnosis of recurrent depressive disorder they would not receive this diagnosis again, although conditions at baseline that can reoccur, such as suicide attempt, would not be excluded. Models will be adjusted for age, gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and other childhood conditions (asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, thyroid disease, epilepsy, diabetes, cancer, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) including systemic JIA, systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis). Statistical significance for analyses will be reported using P values and 95% confidence intervals as appropriate."
9,page_9,"10 Cumulative risk (i.e. prevalence) of the ‘any psychological condition’ composite outcome will be evaluated up to age 25. Cumulative incidence will be calculated by using methods to estimate risk similar to those recently published when assessing lifetime risk of other chronic conditions in the Lancet.(11, 12) Key outputs will be cumulative risk plots, presenting the cumulative incidence of the outcome by age for PIBD patients compared to controls. At a particular age, the cumulative incidence estimate can be interpreted as the lifetime incidence of the outcome up until the year of age in question. Childhood cumulative risk will be defined as the cumulative incidence at age 18. Stream 1: Sensitivity analysis To evaluate the magnitude of potential bias from including, as matched controls, people who are registered with GP practices but who do not attend their practice, we also repeated the primary analysis including only controls with a least one primary care consultation in the year preceding their index date. All statistical analyses were performed using R statistical package software version 3.4.1. The study was conducted in line with the RECORD (Reporting of studies conducted using observational routinely collected data) guidelines.(13) Stream 2: Stream 2: Study design The proposed study will use the retrospectively collected data of all eligible patients within the database at the date of data extraction. Within this primary care cohort, all patients with IBD will be identified using diagnostic codes and prescription records. A diagnostic algorithm will be developed to facilitate robust case identification of IBD and IBD subtypes as well as mental health outcomes."
10,page_10,"11 Stream 2: Study cohort The eligible IBD cases will comprise all prevalent cases of IBD aged under 25 at 01/01/2015 (index date) comprising of the three main subtypes; ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease (CD) and IBD unclassified (IBDU), excluding microscopic colitis, radiation induced enterocolitis and drug-induced enterocolitis. We will extract sociodemographic details for all individuals. Sociodemographic data will comprise by age group, age at diagnosis, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Ethnicity will be categorised as follows to be consistent with the UK official census categories: White, Asian, Black African/Caribbean, Mixed, and Other. The index of multiple deprivation (IMD) will be used as a measure of socioeconomic status. This is derived from patient postcode at the point of data extraction. We will identify comorbid psychological condition groups in all people with PIBD. These will comprise 3 composite phenotypes; anxiety/panic disorders, major depression or depressive episodes, and other psychological conditions. Other psychological conditions will be a composite of; eating disorders, body image disorder, attention-deficit disorder (ADHD), behavioural disorders, adjustment disorder, acute stress disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Where numbers are sufficient, subgroups of the broad ‘other psychological conditions’ composite may be examined. At the index date, we will define groups in the IBD case population based on mental health phenotype, including a comparator group without mental health comorbidity at the index date, and compare the sociodemographic characteristics of these groups. Stream 2: Follow-up We will then describe incidence of each study outcome in the five years after the index date for each group, and the relative incidence of each outcome in those with and without mental health comorbidity."
11,page_11,"12 Stream 2: Study outcomes These will comprise the following. Quality of life indicators: Affective symptoms (depression, low mood, deliberate self-harm, suicidal ideation or parasuicide), IBD symptoms, absence from school, absence from work, unemployment, substance abuse, and sleep problems. IBD symptoms will comprise; abdominal pain, discomforts or bloating, diarrhoea, weight loss, growth retardation and tiredness/fatigue. (See Appendix 1 – Table s1 for Read Codes and SNOMED codes). IBD severity indicators: Medication use, surgical intervention, nutritional supplement use, and markers of nutritional status. Surgical intervention will comprise any abdominal surgery, and stoma formation (as a separate outcome). Medication use will comprise use of: rectal 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), oral 5-ASA, rectal steroids, oral steroids, antimetabolites, tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) and other biologic therapies. The latter of these groups may not be well captured in primary care and if so this will be reported in the limitations section of the final study manuscript. Nutritional supplements will comprise the five most prescribed nutritional supplements: Modulen, Fortisip, Ensure, Osmolite, and Neocate. Nutritional markers will comprise; being underweight (under the 5th centile of weight for height or BMI < 18.5 kg/m2 after age 18) and growth retardation related codes. (See Appendix 1 – Table s2 for Read Codes and SNOMED codes). Healthcare resource utilisation: Primary care attendances and hospital admissions. Hospital admissions will be separated into general admissions (including those for IBD) and psychiatric admissions. (See Appendix 1 – Table s2 for Read Codes and SNOMED codes)."
12,page_12,"13 Stream 2: Statistical methods We will use standard descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviations, etc) to describe the characteristics of the study cohort overall and by mental health phenotype. Across mental health condition phenotypes we will describe the incidence of recording of all the quality-of-life indicators, IBD severity markers, and healthcare resource utilisation outcomes up to five years after the index date (01/01/2015), compared to incidence in the group without mental health conditions. The end of follow-up will be the first of; 01/01/2020 (5 years after the index date) we will not follow patients up into 2020/21 due to changes in patient health behaviour and primary care interactions due to COVID-19, the patient’s 25th birthday, date of loss to follow-up (either deregistration or death). All individuals contributing at least six months of follow-up time in the analysis will be included. We will not follow patients up into 2020/21 due to changes in patient health behaviour and primary care interactions due to COVID-19. Relative incidence between those with and without mental health conditions will be estimated for repeated events (e.g. number of hospital admissions) and binary events (e.g. quality of life indicators) using, as appropriate, Poisson regression, negative binomial regression (if we need to account for overdispersion), or zero- inflated Poisson regression (if we need to model rare events). To account for variable duration of follow-up, we will include the natural logarithm of person- years of follow-up as a model offset. Confidence intervals will be estimated using robust SEs. Models will be adjusted for age, gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and other childhood conditions (asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, thyroid disease, epilepsy, diabetes, cancer, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) including systemic JIA, systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and psoriatic arthritis). Statistical significance for analyses will be reported using P values and 95% confidence intervals as appropriate. Where numbers allow, we will report absolute and relative incidence in subgroups by, mental health condition group, age group (5-<12; 12-<16; 16-<18; 18-<25) (child, adolescent, young adult), and sex."
