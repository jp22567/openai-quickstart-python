Strict adherence to an avoidance diet can be complicated by difficulty in interpreting', 'food labels (Joshi, 2002), the presence of undeclared or hidden allergens in commercially', 'prepared foods (Vierk, 2002; Altschul, 2001), and inattention to or mistrust of food warning', 'labels (Vierk, 2007). Foods prepared outside the home (eg, at school, daycare centers,', 'restaurants, homes of family/friends) present additional sources of accidental exposure.', 'Accidental food allergen exposures are common, with 55% of peanut-allergic patients', 'experiencing at least 1 allergic reaction over approximately 5 years (Sicherer, 1998). The', 'burden of avoidance and constant fear of accidental exposure can negatively affect the', 'health-related quality of life (HRQOL) for patients with peanut allergy and their families', '(Anagnostou, 2014; Avery, 2003; Primeau, 2000).', 'Early clinical studies of peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) demonstrated promising safety', 'and efficacy of this approach in peanut-allergic patients (Anagnostou, 2014; Yu, 2012;', 'Varshney, 2011; Blumchen, 2010; Hofmann, 2009; Jones, 2009). Each of these studies', 'included an oral food challenge to evaluate desensitization after completion of a period of', 'dosing with increasing amounts of peanut flour, peanut protein, or whole crushed roasted', 'peanuts, followed by a period of maintenance therapy, and showed that peanut OIT was', 'generally well tolerated and could induce a clinically meaningful level of desensitization.', 'Symptoms associated with peanut OIT included rash, wheezing, rhinorrhea, sneezing,', 'itching, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.
