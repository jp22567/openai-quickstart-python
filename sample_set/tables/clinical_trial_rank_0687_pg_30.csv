Single ECG required at End of Study. On days where ECG time points align with PK sampling time points, ECGs must be performed prior to PK samples being drawn. ECGS will be collected and stored centrally."

This may be performed at the EOT visit. 11. Imaging is only required for participants with extramedullary disease (CT, MRI, or PET/CT can be applied per local guidance).
